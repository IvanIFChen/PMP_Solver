                   To life
        Whose every day is a project
      That I run from time's shoulders.
               To my friends,
            the key stakeholders:
Gurmail Kandola, John Serri, and Kulwinder
Baldev Khullar, Ruth Gordon, and Bhupinder
Stanley Wong and Srilatha are a few to name.
       With friends, I can see clearly
          Through storm and rain.
           Friends without whom
      Every path is just a trail of dust.
     With whom I'm like the first man
       Walking on the planet Earth.
Acknowledgments
        ach time I get a book published, I re-learn a lesson that transforming an idea into a fin-
   E    ished book takes a project (it produces a unique product--that is, the book--and it has a
   beginning and an end) and a project team. As they say (well, if they don't anymore, they should),
   first things first. Let me begin by thanking Mitzi Koontz for initiating this project. With two
   thumbs up, thanks to Cathleen Small for managing this project from the planning stage
   through the executing stage, the monitoring/controlling stage, and all the way to the closing
   stage.
   It's my pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of other members of the team as well: Bill
   Hartman for layout, Sandy Doell for proofreading, and Kelly Talbot for indexing. My special
   thanks to Paul Gneco, the technical editor of this book, for carefully reviewing a number of
   chapters and offering valuable feedback.
   In some ways, writing this book is an expression of the project manager and educator inside
   me. I thank some great minds from whom I directly or indirectly learned about management
   during my journey in the computer industry from Novell to Dream Logic: Chuck Castleton
   at Novell, Delon Dotson at Netscape and MP3.com, Kate Peterson at Weborder, and Dr. John
   Serri at Dream Logic. I also thank my colleagues and seniors in the field of education for help-
   ing me in so many ways to become a better educator. Here are a few to mention: Dr. Gerald
   Pauler (Brooks College), Professor David Hayes (San Jose State University), Professor Michael
   Burke (San Jose State University), and Dr. John Serri (University of Phoenix).
   Last, but not least, my appreciation (along with my heart) goes to my wife, Renee, and my son,
   Adam, for not only peacefully coexisting with my projects, but also for supporting them.

Introduction

   "`Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'"
   --Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll




       he primary purpose of this book is to help you pass the Project Management Professional
   T   (PMP) exam administered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). Because the book
   has a laser-sharp focus on the exam objectives, expert project managers who want to pass the
   PMP exam can use this book to ensure that they do not miss any objective. Yet this is not an
   exam-cram book. The chapters and the sections within each chapter are presented in a logical
   learning sequence: A topic and a chapter only depend upon the previously covered topics and
   chapters, and there is no hopping from topic to topic. The concepts and topics, both simple
   and complex, are clearly explained when they appear for the first time. No prior knowledge of
   project management is assumed. This facilitates stepwise learning, prevents confusion, and
   makes this book useful also for beginners who want to get up to speed quickly to pass the
   PMP exam, even if they are new to the discipline of project management.


Who This Book Is For
   With a focus on the PMP exam topics, this book is designed to serve the following audiences:
        Project management practitioners who want to prepare for the PMP exam.
        Entry-level project managers and project team members who want to prepare for the
        PMP exam.
        Beginners who want to join the field of project management.
        Project managers who want a book to use as a quick and easy reference to the disci-
        pline of project management.
        Instructors and trainers who want a textbook for a course on project management.
                                                                                 Introduction          xv


How This Book Is Organized
   This book tells the story of project management in a cohesive, concise, yet comprehensive
   fashion. The book is written to the most current version of the PMP exam based on the
   Fourth Edition of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) by
   PMI. The discipline of project management, according to the PMBOK Guide, contains nine
   knowledge areas, such as cost management and quality management, and five process groups:
   initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. The PMBOK Guide
   and almost all project management exam books are organized along the knowledge areas. How-
   ever, the exam objectives published by PMI, referred to as tasks in the exam specifications by
   PMI, are organized in order of the process groups. This poses a problem for the reader prepar-
   ing for the exam based on exam objectives. For example, one of these books refers to 11 chap-
   ters for one exam objective in its exam readiness checklist. This book solves that problem by
   presenting the material in order of process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring
   and controlling, and closing. This order of presentation is also consistent with the lifecycle of
   a project, and therefore facilitates natural learning by connecting to real-world experience.



How Each Chapter Is Organized
   With the exception of Chapter 1, on project management framework, each chapter begins with
   a list of exam objectives on which the chapter is focused. These objectives are officially called
   tasks by PMI, and these tasks are organized into domains, which are essentially the process
   groups, except the last domain. I have exactly followed the order of the domains published by
   PMI, but I have shuffled around a few objectives to keep the topics and the subject matter in
   line with sequential learning and to avoid hopping from topic to topic.
   The first section in each chapter is an introduction in which I establish three underlying con-
   cepts or topics that will be explored in the chapter. Each chapter has the following features:
        Exam Objectives. Each exam objective covered in the chapter is fully explained at
        the beginning of the chapter.
        Big Picture. Each chapter begins with introducing the big picture of the topics cov-
        ered in the chapter. This prepares the reader for a smooth dive into the details.
        Study Checkpoints. Each chapter in its body presents Study Checkpoints, which
        are exercises to ensure that you get the crucial points in the covered material. The
        solution to Study Checkpoints are presented in Appendix A.
        Notes and Tips. As you read through a chapter, you will find Notes that present
        additional helpful material related to the topic being described and Tips that provide
        additional real-world insight into the topic being discussed.
        Summary. The Summary section of each chapter provides the big, unified picture
        while reviewing the important concepts in the chapter.
xvi    Introduction


              Exam's Eye View. The Exam's Eye View section highlights the important points in
              the chapter from the perspective of the exam: the things that you must comprehend,
              the things that you should watch out for because they might not seem to fit in with
              the ordinary order of things, and the facts that you should memorize for the exam.
              Key Terms and Definitions. This section lists the important terms and concepts
              introduced in the chapter along with their definitions.
              Review Questions. Each chapter ends with a Review Questions section that has a
              two-pronged purpose: to help you test your knowledge about the material presented
              in the chapter and to help you evaluate your ability to answer the exam questions
              based on the exam objectives covered in the chapter. The answers to the review
              questions are presented in Appendix B.



      About the PMP Exam
        This book covers the material for the PMP exam. Passing this exam is necessary to obtain PMP
        certification.
        To be eligible to take the PMP exam, you must meet a set of minimum requirements. A sum-
        mary of these requirements and other details are listed in the following table.

As mentioned previously, the PMP exam objectives are organized along the process groups
(stages of the project lifecycle, as we call them in this book). These process groups and the top-
ics of professional and social responsibility are called the domains. The relative weight given to
these domains in the PMP exam is listed in the following table.

If you have already taken the CAPM exam, which is not a requirement for the PMP exam,
you should know that the main differences between the questions in the two exams are the
following:
      The PMP exam will have situational questions that assume you have been working
      in the project management field.
      The CAPM exam is entirely based on the PMBOK Guide, whereas the PMP exam
      can have questions on topics not covered in the PMBOK Guide or not covered in
      much detail. Some of these topics are management theories and professional and
      social responsibilities based on the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by the
      PMI. Of course, this book covers these topics.
The following points are common to both the PMP and CAPM exams:
      Pretest questions are randomly placed throughout the examination. Your score does
      not depend on these questions.
      Computer-based exams are preceded by a 15-minute computer tutorial, which is not
      part of the allotted exam time.
      The passing score is determined by an approach called the Modified Angoff
      Technique, which relies on the collective judgment of groups of CAPM certificants
      from around the globe. The final passing score for the examination is based on this
      pooled judgment and the calculation of the standard error on the mean. Finally, item
      analysis and reliability indices are calculated for each question.
These credential examinations are offered via computer at locations in North America and in
other countries around the world. For a complete list of computer-based testing locations,

xviii   Introduction


         For the most up-to-date information regarding these examinations, please visit the certifica-
         tion section of PMI's website at www.pmi.org.
         Following are a few tips that you can use during the exam:
              PMI has a very formal way of naming processes, process groups, knowledge areas,
              and some documents. However, just like in real life, do not expect that the exam will
              always refer to these names in a formal way. To help you on this issue, this book
              refers to these names in both formal and informal ways. For example, controlling
              quality (informal) means the Perform Quality Control process (formal), scope man-
              agement (informal) means Project Scope Management (formal), and initiating (or
              initiation) means Initiating Process Group.
              The questions in the PMP exam can be wordy and might include unnecessary infor-
              mation to distract you from the relevant facts. So, you need to read the questions
              carefully and patiently and figure out what counts and what does not.
              Get comfortable with the idea that there will be some questions that you will not be
              able to answer correctly. In such a situation, just believe in yourself and your experi-
              ence, and accordingly select the best answer. You may have the option to leave these
              questions for a possible review later if you have time. (Read the instructions before
              starting the exam to find out.) Key point: Move on without getting frustrated.
              There will be tricky questions to weed out candidates who might have project man-
              agement experience, but who do not have an in-depth understanding of the disci-
              pline of project management from the perspective of PMI, as covered in this book.
              There will be questions for which you will need to choose between an innocent way
              of skipping the formal process to save time and following the formal project man-
              agement process. In almost all cases, the correct answer will be to follow the process.
              There will be questions for which you will need to choose between facing the prob-
              lem head on or taking an easy way out, such as dodging a thorny issue, ignoring a
              challenging problem, or postponing a difficult decision. Almost always, the correct
              answer is to meet the problem head on in a professional manner.
              To answer some questions correctly, understand that in the world of project manage-
              ment as seen from the perspective of PMI, project managers communicate directly
              and clearly and do not say things between the lines. For example, if you have a prob-
              lem with a team member, you talk to the team member face to face rather than
              going to the member's manager, which you might need to do eventually if you can't
              solve the problem by directly dealing with the team member.
              Understand clearly the roles of the key stakeholders, such as the project manager,
              project sponsor, and customer. Especially understand your responsibilities as a project
              manager. You need to be proactive to make decisions and manage the project, influ-
              ence the factors that contribute to changes rather than waiting for the changes to
              occur, and have up-to-date information about the project.
         Best wishes for the exam; go for it!

Introduction
  What do the Taj Mahal, the Internet, and this book have in common? Projects! All three of
  them are products of projects. Even given all the required material and the knowledge, how do
  people really build immense and complex structures or systems, such as the Taj Mahal of Agra,
  the Eiffel Tower of Paris, or the World Wide Web of the Information Age? The answer is again
  projects. Through projects, it is possible to build small and big and simple and complex things
  in an effective and efficient manner. All projects need to be managed. A so-called unmanaged
  project is simply a poorly managed project that is destined to fail. Therefore, the importance
  of project management cannot be overstated.
  Managing a project means managing the lifecycle of the project, starting from the beginning
  (initiating) and going to the end (closing); this is accomplished using processes, which consti-
  tute what are called project management knowledge areas. Although you use your knowledge in
  terms of processes to manage the projects, the management will be greatly influenced by the
  environment in which the project runs, such as the structure and culture of the performing
  organization.
  The goal of this chapter is to walk you through the framework of project management. To that
  end, we will explore three avenues: the project lifecycle, project management knowledge areas,
  and the project environment.



Basic Concepts
  Each discipline of knowledge builds upon some basic concepts. The terms that refer to or define
  these concepts make up the language of the discipline. The very basic terms in project man-
  agement are described briefly in the following list:
       Project. A project is a work effort made over a finite period of time with a start and
       a finish to create a unique product, service, or result. Because a project has a start
       and an end, it is also called a temporary effort or endeavor.
       Organization. An organization is a group of individuals organized to work for some
       purpose or mission. Computer companies, energy companies (to whom you pay your
       electric bills), and cable companies are examples of organizations. An organization
       might offer products, such as books and donuts, or services, such as Internet access
       or online banking. A project is usually performed inside an organization. Organiza-
       tion is a very general concept that includes groups for profit and nonprofit, public
       and private, and government and nongovernment.
              PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                              Chapter 1          5


 Project stakeholder. A project stakeholder is an individual or an organization that
 can be positively or negatively affected by the project execution. A project can have a
 wide spectrum of stakeholders, from the project sponsor, to an environmental orga-
 nization, to an ordinary citizen.
 Process. A process is a set of related tasks performed to manage a certain aspect of a
 project, such as cost. Each process belongs to a knowledge area and corresponds to a
 process group.
 Knowledge area. A knowledge area in project management is defined by its knowl-
 edge requirements related to managing a specific aspect of a project, such as cost, by
 using a set of processes. PMI recognizes a total of nine knowledge areas, such as cost
 management and human resource management.
 Performing organization. The performing organization is the organization that is
 performing the project.
 Project management. Project management is the usage of knowledge, skills, and
 tools to manage a project from start to finish with the goal of meeting the project
 requirements. It involves using the appropriate processes.
 Program. A program is a set of related projects managed in a coordinated fashion to
 improve overall efficiency and effectiveness and to obtain benefits and control that
 would not be obtained by managing them individually. For example, a program
 could be delivering a product (or service) that consists of sub-products (or service
 components) delivered by the constituent projects. Also, a program might include
 related work that is not included in the scope of any of the constituent projects.
 Program management. Program management is the centralized, coordinated man-
 agement of a specific program to achieve its strategic goals, objectives, and benefits.
 Program management office (PMO). The program management office is an entity
 in an organization that is responsible for providing centralized, coordinated support
 to the program managers managing programs and unrelated projects.
 Project management office. Project management office (PMO) refers to an entity
 in an organization that is responsible for providing centralized coordinated manage-
 ment and support for projects in the organization.


        ALERT
 Although both have the same abbreviation, PMO, the project management office and
 program management office are not identical. For example, only an organization that
 runs programs will have a program management office, whereas an organization that
 runs individual projects can have a project management office.
6     Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


                Portfolio. A portfolio is a set of projects, programs, and related work that is man-
                aged in a coordinated fashion to obtain business objectives in the strategic plan of
                the organization.
                Portfolio management. Portfolio management is the centralized management of
                one or more portfolios that includes identifying, authorizing, prioritizing, managing,
                and controlling projects, programs, and other related work in order to obtain specific
                business objectives in the strategic plan of the organization.
        This is a minimal set of terms that you need to understand before you can start exploring the
        world of project management. More terms will be introduced as you continue exploring the
        discipline of project management in this book.
        Now that you understand these basic terms, you can ask a very basic question: What does it
        mean to manage a project? In other words, what's involved in managing a project?


    Managing Projects
        Before getting into project management, you need to understand what a project is. At any orga-
        nization there are many activities being executed every day. Most of these activities are orga-
        nized into groups of interrelated activities. These groups fall into two categories: projects and
        operations. An operation is an ongoing and repetitive set of tasks, whereas a project has a life-
        cycle--a beginning and an end.


    Understanding a Project
        A project is a work effort made over a finite period of time with a start and a finish to create
        a unique product, service, or result. Because a project has a start and a finish, it is also called a
        temporary effort or endeavor. In other words, a project is a temporary endeavor taken to create
        a unique product, service, or result. So, a project has two defining characteristics: It is tempo-
        rary, and it creates a unique product. Let's explore further these two defining concepts: tem-
        porary and unique.
        Temporary. The temporary nature of projects refers to the fact that each project has a definite
        beginning and a definite end. A project can reach its end in one of two possible ways:
                The project has met its objectives--that is, the planned unique product has been
                created.
                The project has been terminated before its successful completion for whatever reason.
        The temporary nature of projects can also apply to two other aspects:
                The opportunity to market the product that the project will produce is temporary--
                that is, the product needs to be produced in a limited timeframe; otherwise, it will
                be too late.
                A project team is temporary--that is, the project team is disbanded after the project
                ends, and the team members may be individually assigned to other projects.
                       PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                    Chapter 1      7


   However, remember that the temporary nature of a project does not refer to the product it cre-
   ates. The projects can create lasting products, such as the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower, or the
   Internet. The second defining characteristic of a project is that it must create a unique
   product.
   Unique product. The outcome of a project must be a unique product, service, or result. How
   do a product, a service, and a result differ from each other?
        Product. This is a tangible, quantifiable artifact that is either the end item or a com-
        ponent of it. The big-screen television set in your living room, the Swiss watch on
        your wrist, and the wine bottle on your table are some examples of products.
        Service. Actually, when we say a project can create a service, we really mean the
        capability to perform a service. For example, a project that creates a website for a
        bank to offer online banking has created the capability to offer the online banking
        service.
        Result. This is usually the knowledge-related outcome of a project--for example,
        the results of an analysis performed in a research project.
   Quite often, I will refer to product, service, or result as just "product" for brevity.
   Projects are organized to execute a set of activities that cannot be addressed within the limits
   of the organization's ongoing normal operations. To clearly identify whether an undertaking is
   a project, you must understand the difference between a project and an operation.


Distinguishing Projects from Operations
   An organization executes a multitude of activities as part of the work to achieve objectives.
   Some of these activities are to support projects and others are to support what are called oper-
   ations. An operation is a set of tasks that does not qualify to be a project. In other words, an
   operation is a function that performs ongoing tasks: It does not produce a unique (new) prod-
   uct or it does not have a beginning and an end--or both. For example, to put a data center
   together is a project, but after you put it together, keeping it up and running is an operation.
   It is important to understand that projects and operations share some characteristics, such as
   the following:
           Both require resources, including human resources (people).
           Both are constrained to limited, as opposed to unlimited, resources.
           Both are managed--that is, planned, executed, and controlled.
           Both have objectives.
   The distinctions between projects and operations can be made by sticking to the definition of
   a project--that it is temporary and unique. Operations are generally ongoing and repetitive.
   Although both projects and operations have objectives, a project ends when its objectives are
   met, whereas an operation continues toward attaining a new set of objectives when the current
   set of objectives has been attained.
8     Part I         INITIATING THE PROJECT


          Projects can be performed at various levels of an organization; they vary in size, and accord-
          ingly can involve just one person or a team. Table 1.1 presents some examples of projects.


           Table 1.1 Examples of Projects
           Project                                           Outcome (Product, Service, or Result)

           Constructing Eiffel Tower                         Product

           Running presidential election campaign            Results: win or lose; Products: documents

           Developing a website to offer online education    Service

           Setting up a computer network in one building     Service

           Moving a computer network from one building       Result: network is moved
           to another

           Study the genes of members of Congress            Results (of the research); Product: research paper



    STUDY CHECKPOINT 1.1
    Identify each of the following items as a project or an operation.
     A.   Restaurant employees serving breakfast to the customers every day
     B.   A bookseller processing customer orders
     C.   A network administrator ensuring that the network stays up and running 24x7
     D.   Writing and publishing a book


          A project can result in a product (or service) that is sustained by an operation. For example,
          constructing the Eiffel Tower is a project, whereas managing it for the tourists visiting it every
          day is an operation.
          How do projects come into existence? In other words, how do you come up with a project?
          Sure, you have an idea, a concept of some final product, but how exactly do you write it down
          and declare it a project? A project is born and brought up through a procedure called progres-
          sive elaboration.


    Understanding Progressive Elaboration
          As the saying goes: Rome was not built in a day. Rest assured, the product of a project--even
          the project plan--is not built in a day, either. Usually there is a concept first and a broad vision
          for the end product--that is, the outcome of the project. The clearer vision you have of the
          unique product that you want from the project, the more accurate the project plan will be. So,
          you move toward the final project plan in incremental steps as the ideas about the final product
                       PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                   Chapter 1           9


   are refined and as you get more and more information about the requirements in a progressive
   fashion. This procedure of defining (or planning) a project is called progressive elaboration.
   Here is an example of progressive elaboration. You wake up one morning with an idea to close
   the digital gap in your community. Now, you have a concept of the final product (result) of
   your project: Close the digital gap in your community. But what do you really mean by that?
   It might include many things--building computers in an economical way and providing them
   at low prices to those who don't have them, raising awareness of the necessity of computer lit-
   eracy, offering classes, and the like. Now you are really working to refine your idea of the final
   product. The second question is, how are you going to do this? Here you are referring to the
   project plan. You can see that the project plan and its accuracy and details depend upon how
   refined the idea of the final product is. The final product or objectives and the plan to achieve
   them will be elaborated further in steps.


                TIP
         Uncontrolled changes that make it into the project without being properly processed
         are called scope creep. Do not confuse progressive elaboration with scope creep.


   Progressive elaboration, in general, means developing something in incremental steps. The pro-
   ject plan will be broadly defined to start and will get more accurate, detailed, and explicit in an
   incremental fashion as better understanding about the project deliverables and objectives devel-
   ops. It involves successive iterations of the planning process resulting in a more accurate and
   complete plan.
   Even after you have an approved final project plan and the project starts executing, progressive
   elaboration continues to some extent. For example, you will see later in this chapter that exe-
   cution and planning stages of the project interact with each other.
   Each stage of a project is managed by performing a set of processes.


Understanding a Process
   Processes are the heart of project management. If you want to think of project management
   like a project management professional, think in terms of processes. Almost everything in the
   world of project management is done through processes.
   What is a process, anyway? Back up a little and look around you; you will see processes every-
   where, not only in project management. For example, when you make coffee in the morning,
   you go through a process. The water, the coffee filter, and the roasted hazelnut coffee made by
   grinding golden-colored beans are the input items to this process. The coffeemaker is the tool,
   and how you made the coffee is the technique. A cup of freshly brewed hazelnut coffee is an
   output item from this process. So, a process is a set of interrelated activities performed to obtain
   a specified set of products, results, or services. A process, as explained in the example and in
   Figure 1.1, consists of three elements: input, tools and techniques, and output.
10     Part I         INITIATING THE PROJECT




                FIGURE 1.1 Three elements of a process: input, tools and techniques, and output

         Of course, you can come up with other examples of processes that you have been using in your
         life without realizing it. In project management, you use processes to accomplish things, such
         as developing a project schedule, directing and managing the project execution, and develop-
         ing and managing the project team.
         As illustrated in Figure 1.1, each process consists of three elements, described in the following
         list:
                 Input. The input to a process consists of the raw data that is needed to start the
                 process. For example, the list of activities that need to be scheduled is one of several
                 input items to the process that will be used to develop the schedule of a project.
                 Tools and techniques. Tools and techniques are the methods used to operate on the
                 input to transform it into output. For example, project management software that
                 helps to develop a schedule is a tool used in the schedule development process.
                 Output. The output is the outcome or the result of a process. Each process contains
                 at least one output item; otherwise, there would be no point in performing a process.
                 For example, an output item of the schedule development process is, well, the project
                 schedule.
         Now that you understand what a process is, you likely realize that you will be using different
         processes at the different stages of a project, such as planning and execution. Actually, the whole
         lifecycle of a project can be understood in terms of five stages, with each stage corresponding
         to a group of processes.


     Understanding the Project Lifecycle
         From initiation/authorization to completion/closure, a project goes through a whole lifecycle
         that includes defining the project objectives, planning the work to achieve those objectives, per-
         forming the work, monitoring and controlling the progress, and closing the project after receiv-
         ing the product acceptance. Figure 1.2 shows the different stages of the project lifecycle; the
         arrows indicate the flow of information.
                    PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                         Chapter 1    11




    FIGURE 1.2 Different stages in the lifecycle of a project. Each of these stages represents a
                   process group.

The five stages, called process groups, of a project lifecycle are described in the following list.
Initiating. This stage defines and authorizes the project. The project manager is named, and
the project is officially launched through a signed document called the project charter, which
contains items such as the purpose of the project, a high-level product description, a summary
of the milestone schedule, and a business case for the project. Another outcome of this stage
is a document called the stakeholder register, which identifies the project stakeholders and impor-
tant information about them. The processes used to perform this stage fall into a group called
the initiating process group.


             NOTE
      In the discipline of project management, like in many other disciplines, the term high-
      level means lacking details or not referring to details. Keep this meaning in mind
      when you read the terms in this book, such as high-level product description, high-
      level plan, and the like. Details are usually worked out through a process called pro-
      gressive elaboration.
12   Part I       INITIATING THE PROJECT


       Planning. In this stage, you, the project manager, along with the project management team,
       refine the project objectives and requirements and develop the project management plan, which
       is a collection of several plans that constitute a course of actions required to achieve the objec-
       tives and meet the requirements of the project. The project scope is finalized with the project
       scope statement. The project management plan, the outcome of this stage, contains subsidiary
       plans, such as a project scope management plan, a schedule management plan, and a quality
       management plan. The processes used to perform this stage fall into a group called the plan-
       ning process group.
       Executing. In this stage, you, the project manager, implement the project management plan,
       and the project team performs the work scheduled in the planning stage. You coordinate all
       the activities being performed to achieve the project objectives and meet the project require-
       ments. Of course, the main output of this project is the project deliverables. Approved changes,
       recommendations, and defect repairs are also implemented in this stage. But where do these
       changes and recommendations come from? They arise from monitoring and controlling the
       project. The stakeholders can also suggest changes, which must go through an approval process
       before implementation. The project execution is performed using the processes that fall into a
       group called the executing process group.
       Monitoring and controlling. You monitor and control the project through its lifecycle, includ-
       ing the executing stage. Monitoring and controlling includes defending the project against
       scope creep (unapproved changes to the project scope), monitoring the project progress and
       performance to identify variance from the plan, and recommending preventive and corrective
       actions to bring the project in line with the planned expectations in the approved project man-
       agement plan. Requests for changes, such as change to the project scope, are also included in
       this stage; they can come from you or from any other project stakeholder. The changes must
       go through an approval process, and only the approved changes are implemented. The processes
       used in this stage fall into a group called the monitoring and controlling process group.
       Closing. In this stage, you manage the formal acceptance of the project product, close any
       contracts involved, and bring the project to an end by disbanding the project team. Closing the
       project includes conducting a project review for lessons learned and possibly turning over the
       outcome of the project to another group, such as the maintenance or operations group. Don't
       forget the last, but not the least, task of the closing stage: celebration. Terminated projects
       (that is, projects cancelled before completion) should also go through the closing stage. The
       processes used to perform the closing stage fall into the group called the closing process group.


                    NOTE
              What we refer to as project stages here are not actually the project phases. A project
              phase is part of the whole project in which certain milestones or project deliverables
              are completed. All these stages, technically called process groups, can be applied to
              any phase of a project that is divided into multiple phases.

   Table 1.2 presents a summary of the project lifecycle. The initiating stage authorizes a project
   by naming the project manager, the planning stage further defines the project objectives and
   plans the work to meet those objectives, the execution stage executes the work, the monitor-
   ing and controlling stage monitors the progress of the project and controls it to keep it in line
   with the plan, and the closing stage formally closes the project by obtaining the product accep-
   tance. Each of these stages is performed by using a group of processes. Thereby, these stages
   are called process groups. In the table these process groups are mapped to another set of names
   for the project stages: starting the project, organizing and preparing, carrying out the work,
   and closing the project.

   The stages of a project or process groups determine when a process is executed, whereas the
   processes themselves belong to certain knowledge areas of project management.


Understanding Project Management Knowledge Areas
   Managing projects requires applying knowledge, skills, and tools and techniques to project
   activities in order to meet the project objectives. You do this by performing some processes at
   various stages of the project, discussed in the previous section. That means processes are part
   of the knowledge required to manage projects. Each aspect of a project is managed by using
   the corresponding knowledge area. For example, each project has a scope that needs to be
   managed, and the knowledge required to manage scope is in the knowledge area called project
14   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


       scope management. To perform the project work within the project scope, you need human
       resources, which need to be managed; the knowledge used to manage human resources is
       called human resource management. You get the idea. Each process belongs to one of the nine
       knowledge areas discussed in the following list.
       Project scope management. The primary purpose of project scope management is to ensure
       that all the required work (and only the required work) is performed to complete the project
       successfully. This is accomplished by defining and controlling what is included in the project
       and what is not. To be specific, project scope management includes the following:
               Collect requirements. Collect the requirements for the project based on the stake-
               holders' needs, which will determine the project scope.
               Define scope. Develop the description for the project and its products, which is the
               basis for the project scope.
               Create the work breakdown structure (WBS). Decompose the project deliverables
               into smaller, more manageable work components. The outcome of this exercise is
               called the work breakdown structure.
               Verify scope. Plan how the completed deliverables of the project will be accepted.
               Control scope. Control changes to the project scope--only the approved changes to
               the scope should be implemented.
       Obviously, these components are performed by using the corresponding processes. So, project
       scope management, in part, defines the work required to complete the project. It's a finite
       amount of work and will require a finite amount of time, which needs to be managed as well.
       Project time management. The primary purpose of project time management is to
       develop and control the project schedule. This is accomplished by performing the following
       components:
               Define activities. Identify all the work activities that need to be scheduled to pro-
               duce the project deliverables.
               Sequence activities. Identify the dependencies among the activities that need to be
               scheduled (that is, the schedule activities) so that they can be scheduled in the right
               order.
               Estimate activity resources. For each schedule activity, estimate the types of
               resources needed and the quantity for each type.
               Estimate activity durations. Estimate the time needed to complete each schedule
               activity.
               Develop schedule. Analyze the data created in the previous steps to develop the
               schedule.
               Control schedule. Control changes to the project schedule.
       You perform these tasks by using the corresponding processes. It will cost you to get the activ-
       ities in the schedule completed, and the cost needs to be managed, too.
                    PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                 Chapter 1           15


Project cost management. The primary goal of project cost management is to estimate the cost
and to complete the project within the approved budget. Accordingly, cost management
includes the following components:
     Estimate cost. Develop the cost of the resources needed to complete the project,
     which includes schedule activities and outsourced (procured) work.
     Determine budget. Aggregate the costs of individual activities to establish a cost
     baseline that includes timing.
     Control cost. Monitor and control the cost variance in the project execution--that
     is, the difference between the planned cost and actual cost during execution, as well
     as changes to the project budget.
You will use the appropriate processes to accomplish these tasks. The resources needed to
complete the project activities include human resources, which need to be managed as well.
Project human resource management. The primary purpose of project human resource man-
agement is to obtain, develop, and manage the project team that will perform the project work.
To be specific, project human resource management includes the following components:
     Develop human resources plan. Identify project roles, responsibilities for each role,
     and reporting relationships among the roles. Also, create the staff management plan
     that describes when and how the resource requirements will be met.
     Acquire project team. Obtain the human resources.
     Develop project team. Improve the competencies of the team members and the
     interaction among members to optimize the team performance.
     Manage project team. Track the performance of team members, provide them with
     feedback, and resolve issues and conflicts. This should all be done with the goal to
     enhance performance--that is, to complete the project on time and within the
     planned cost and scope.
These components are performed by using the corresponding processes. There will be situa-
tions in which your organization does not have the expertise to perform certain schedule activ-
ities in-house. For this or other reasons, you might want to acquire some items or services
from an outside vendor. This kind of acquisition is called procurement, which also needs to be
managed.
Project procurement management. The primary purpose of procurement management is to
manage acquiring products (that is, products, services, or results) from outside the project team
in order to complete the project. The external vendor who offers the service is called the seller.
Procurement management includes the following:
     Plan procurements. Identify purchasing needs, specify the procurement approach,
     and identify potential sellers.
     Conduct procurements. Obtain seller responses, select sellers, and issue contracts.
16   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


               Administer procurements. Manage procurement relationships, monitor the pro-
               curement performance, and monitor and control changes in procurement.
               Close procurements. Complete each project procurement with proper closure, such
               as accepting products and closing contracts.
       Be it the procured or the in-house work, there are always some uncertainties that give rise to
       project risks, which need to be managed.
       Project risk management. A project risk is an event that, if it occurs, has a positive or nega-
       tive effect on meeting the project objectives. The primary purpose of project risk management
       is to identify the risks and respond to them should they occur. To be specific, project risk man-
       agement includes the following:
               Plan risk management. Decide how to determine and execute the risk management
               tasks.
               Identify risks. Identify the potential risks relevant to the project at hand and deter-
               mine the characteristics of those risks.
               Perform qualitative risk analysis. Assess the probability of occurrence and the
               impact for each risk in order to prioritize risks for an action or for further analysis.
               Perform quantitative risk analysis. Estimate the effects of identified risks on pro-
               ject objectives.
               Plan risk responses. Develop action options for risks to maximize opportunities for
               and minimize threats to satisfying project objectives.
               Monitor and control risks. Track identified risks, implement risk response plans,
               identify new risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management processes
               throughout the project.
       These tasks related to risk management are performed by using the corresponding processes.
       The goal of risk management is to help meet the project objectives. The degree to which the
       project objectives and requirements are met is called quality, which needs to be managed.
       Project quality management. Project quality is defined as the degree to which a project satis-
       fies its objectives and requirements. For example, a high-quality project is a project that is
       completed on time and with all the work in the project scope completed within the planned
       budget. Project quality management includes the following:
               Plan quality. Determine the quality requirements and standards that are relevant to
               the project at hand and how to apply them.
               Perform quality assurance. Ensure the planned quality requirements and standards
               are applied.
               Perform quality control. Monitor the quality activities and record the results of
               these activities in order to assess performance and make necessary recommendations
               for corrective actions and changes.
                   PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                 Chapter 1          17


These tasks of project quality management are performed by using the corresponding processes.
In order to unify different pieces into a whole project, the different project management activ-
ities need to be integrated.
Project integration management. The project is initiated, planned, and executed in pieces, and
all those pieces are related to each other and need to come together. That is where integration
management comes in. For example, integrating different subsidiary plans into the project man-
agement plan needs to be managed. Project integration management includes developing the
project charter, developing the project management plan, directing and managing project exe-
cution, monitoring and controlling project work, performing integrated change control, and
closing the project or a phase of a project.
So, while managing all the aspects of the project, you, the project manager, will need to coor-
dinate different activities and groups, and for that you need to communicate.
Project communication management. It is absolutely imperative for the success of the pro-
ject that the project information is generated and distributed in a timely fashion. Some would
say communication is the most important aspect of a project and the most important skill for
a project manager to have. But without a doubt, it is certainly a critically important compo-
nent of project management and a common thread that runs through the project lifecycle.
Communication management includes the following:
     Identify stakeholders. Identify all individuals, groups, and organizations that will
     potentially be impacted by the project and find relevant information about them.
     Plan communication. Determine the information and communication needs of the
     project at hand and the communication approach to be used.
     Distribute information. Make the needed information available to the project
     stakeholders in a timely fashion as planned.
     Manage stakeholder expectations. Communicate and work with the stakeholders to
     understand and meet their needs, address the issues, and manage the expectations
     within the project scope and the project management plan.
     Report performance. Collect and distribute performance information to the stake-
     holders to stay on the same page.
As you have seen, managing a project largely means performing a set of processes at various
stages of the project, such as initiating and planning. Accordingly, processes are grouped cor-
responding to these stages, and the groups are called process groups. Processes are part of the
knowledge required to manage projects. Each of these processes belongs to one of the nine
knowledge areas identified in the PMBOK Guide. So a process has a dual membership--one
in a process group, indicating at what stage of the project the process is performed, and the
other in a knowledge area, indicating what aspect of the project is managed by using the
process. Table 1.3 shows this membership for all the processes identified in the PMBOK
Guide.

20     Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


         Each project is performed by individuals, and it can affect individuals or organizations even if
         they are not directly (officially) involved in the project. Now we are talking about the project
         stakeholders.



     Introducing the Project Stakeholders
         Right from the day you assume responsibility for managing a project, you start meeting a very
         special class of people called project stakeholders. It is very important for the success of the pro-
         ject that you identify these individuals and communicate with them effectively throughout the
         project.


     Identifying Project Stakeholders
         Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively
         or negatively) by the project execution and completion. In other words, a project stakeholder
         has something to gain from the project or lose to the project. Accordingly, the stakeholders fall
         into two categories--positive stakeholders, who will normally benefit from the success of the
         project, and negative stakeholders, who see some kind of disadvantage coming from the pro-
         ject. The implications obviously are that the positive stakeholders would like to see the project
         succeed and the negative stakeholders' interests would be better served if the project was delayed
         or cancelled altogether. For example, your city mayor might be a positive stakeholder in a pro-
         ject to open a Walmart store in your neighborhood because it brings business to the city,
         whereas some local business leaders might look at it as a threat to the local businesses and
         thereby may act as negative stakeholders.
         Negative stakeholders are often overlooked by the project manager and the project team,
         which increases the project risk. Ignoring positive or negative project stakeholders will
         have a damaging impact on the project. Therefore, it's important that you, the project man-
         ager, start identifying the project stakeholders early on in the project. The different project
         stakeholders can have different and conflicting expectations, which you need to analyze
         and manage.
         Identifying all the project stakeholders might be a difficult task, but the following are the obvi-
         ous stakeholders, starting with you:
                 Project manager. Include yourself, the project manager, in the list of the stakehold-
                 ers to start with.
                 Project management office (PMO). If your organization has a PMO, and it is
                 directly or indirectly responsible for the outcome of a project, then the PMO is a
                 stakeholder in that project.
              PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                              Chapter 1          21


 Project team. This team consists of the project manager, the project management
 team, and the individuals who perform the work of the project to produce the pro-
 ject outcome. This team may consist of individuals from different groups and
 departments with different subject matter expertise and skills.
 Program manager. If your project is part of a program, then the program manager is
 certainly a stakeholder of your project.
 Portfolio managers and portfolio review board. A portfolio manager is an individ-
 ual who performs high-level management (governance) of a set of projects or pro-
 grams and interfaces between the projects/programs and the business strategy of
 the organization for which the projects and programs are being run. A portfolio
 review board is a committee that selects and rejects the projects by reviewing them
 for factors such as the project value, return on investment, and risks involved in
 performing the project.
 Functional managers. These are the individuals who play the management roles
 within administrative or functional areas of the organization. For example, the VP of
 marketing is a functional manager and so is the director of engineering. The level of
 authority depends on their position in the hierarchy and also the organizational
 structure. For example, if you are using resources that are under a functional man-
 ager, that functional manager is a stakeholder of your project.
 Operational management. These are the individuals who are performing manage-
 ment roles in the operational areas of the organization. For example, the director of
 IT, who is responsible for maintaining the computer network that your team is
 using, is a stakeholder in your project. Depending on your project, you might be
 handing over the product of the project to an operations group that will be responsi-
 ble for providing the long-term support for it.
 Sellers and business partners. Business partners are entities external to the per-
 forming organization, such as contractors and suppliers, that enter into a contractual
 agreement with the performing organization to provide certain components for the
 project. These components are the products, services, or results that you procure.
 Business partners are the external organizations that fill a specific role for the pro-
 ject, such as installing the product of the project, providing training and support for
 the product, or providing specialized expertise for the project. Business partners are
 different from vendors in that they have a special ongoing relationship with the
 organization, which sometimes is attained by satisfying some requirements, such as
 certifications.
 Customer/user. In general, customers are the entity that will acquire the project's
 outcome, such as product, and users are the entity that will use the product. In some
 cases the customers and users may be the same entity, and in other cases there may
 be a whole chain (with different layers) of customers and users. For example, a text-
 book produced by a project run by a publisher is recommended by the instructors,
 bought by the bookstores, and used by the students.
22   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


               Project sponsor. This is the individual or group that provides financial resources for
               the project. A sponsor has a major stake in the project and may perform an active
               role in the project team from time to time. Following are some of the functions of a
               sponsor:
                The sponsor champions the project when it's conceived. This includes gathering
                   support for the project by performing actions such as acting as project spokesper-
                   son to the higher-level management and spelling out the benefits of the project.
                The sponsor leads the project through the selection process until the project is
                   finally authorized, at which point the leadership role goes to the project manager.
                The sponsor plays an important role in developing the initial project scope and
                   charter.
                The sponsor serves as an authority and a catalyst for issues beyond the control of
                   project managers, such as authorizing some critical changes and other yes/no
                   decisions.
       In addition to these key stakeholders, who are easy to identify, there can be a number of other
       stakeholders, who might be more difficult to identify, inside and outside of your organization.
       Depending upon the project, these might include investors, sellers, contractors, family mem-
       bers of the project team members, government agencies, media outlets, lobbying organiza-
       tions, individual citizens, and society at large. Have I left anyone out?
       While dealing with the stakeholders, the keyword is influence. Watch out for influencers who
       are not direct customers or users of the product or service that will come from the project, but
       who can influence the course of the project due to their position in the customer organization
       or the performing organization. The influence can be positive or negative--that is, for or
       against the project.


                      CAUTION
               Do not confuse the project management team with the project team. The project
               management team consists of individuals involved in the project management tasks.
               It is a subset of the project team, which includes the members of the project manage-
               ment team and also other members, such as those who perform the actual work of
               the project.



       So, not only are the stakeholders affected positively and negatively by the project, but the pro-
       ject can also be impacted positively or negatively by them. It is critical for the success of the
       project that you identify positive and negative stakeholders early on in the project, understand
       and analyze their varying and conflicting expectations, and manage those expectations through-
       out the project.
                      PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                 Chapter 1          23


Identifying the Stakeholder Within: Project Manager
   You, the project manager, are a very special project stakeholder yourself. The job (role) of a
   project manager is extremely challenging and thereby exciting. Depending on the organiza-
   tional structure of your organization, you may be reporting to a functional manager, a program
   manager, a portfolio manager, or to some other manager or executive. Nevertheless, it is your
   responsibility to work with your team and other relevant individuals and groups, such as pro-
   gram managers and portfolio managers, to bring all the pieces together and make the project
   happen--that is, to achieve the project objectives. You do this by using a multitude of skills,
   described here.
   Communication. The importance of communication in project management cannot be
   overemphasized. Even a well-scheduled and well-funded project can fail in the hands of a hard-
   working team of experts due to the lack of proper communication. As a project manager, you
   might be dealing with a wide functional variety of individuals, ranging from executives, to
   marketing personnel, to technologists. You should be able to wear different communication hats
   depending upon whom you are communicating with. For example, you will not be using tech-
   nical jargon to talk to executives or marketing folks, and you will not speak marketing lingo to
   the software developers. You will be speaking to different stakeholders in their language, while
   filling the language gap between different functional groups and eliminating misunderstand-
   ings due to miscommunication. The key point is that you put on the appropriate communica-
   tion hat depending on which individual you are communicating with. Be able to switch
   communication hats quickly and avoid technical jargon and acronyms that are not understood
   by the person or group with whom you are communicating. The goal is clarity of the language
   to convey the message accurately.
   You will be communicating throughout the project. So, for a given project, you must develop
   a communication strategy that addresses the following issues:
        What needs to be communicated?
        With whom do you want to communicate? You might need to communicate differ-
        ent items to different individuals or groups.
        How do you want to communicate--that is, what is the medium of communication?
        Again, this might differ depending on whom you are communicating with.
        What is the outcome of your communication? You need to monitor your communi-
        cation and its results to see what works and what does not, so you can improve com-
        munication.
   Communication is an ingredient for many other skills, such as negotiation and problem-
   solving.
24   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


       Negotiation. A negotiation is give and take, with the goal of generating a win-win outcome
       for both parties. You might need to negotiate at any stage of the project lifecycle. Here are some
       examples of negotiations:
               Negotiating with stakeholders regarding expectations during the project planning.
               For example, the suggested deadline for the project schedule might not be practical,
               or you might need a certain type or quantity of resources to make it happen.
               Negotiating with functional managers to obtain human resources, such as software
               developers.
               Negotiating with team members for specific job assignments and possibly during
               conflict resolution among the team members.
               Negotiating changes to the project schedule, budget, or both because a stakeholder
               proposed changes to the project objectives.
               Negotiating with external vendors in procurement. However, in contract negotia-
               tions, representatives from the legal department might be involved.
       Sometimes you will be negotiating to solve a problem.
       Problem-solving. Project-related problems might occur among the stakeholders (including
       team members) or with the projects. Either way, they are there to damage the project. Your
       task is twofold--to identify the problem early enough and to solve it. Here is the general tech-
       nique for accomplishing this:
         1. Look for early warning signs by paying close attention to formal progress reports and
            to what the team members say and do regarding the project.
         2. Once you identify a potential problem, do your homework. Understand and identify
            the problem clearly by collecting more information without passing judgment.
         3. Once the problem and its causes are clearly identified, work with the appropriate stake-
            holders, such as project team members, to explore multiple (alternative) solutions.
         4. Evaluate the multiple solutions and choose the one you will implement.

       The key point throughout the problem-solving process is to focus on the problem, not on the
       individuals, with the goal of finding the solution in order to help the project succeed. There
       should be no finger-pointing.
       Sometimes, in choosing and implementing the correct solution, you will need to exercise your
       influencing skill.
       Influencing. Influencing means getting individuals or groups to do what you want them to do
       without necessarily having formal authority to mandate an outcome from them. This is increas-
       ingly becoming an essential management skill in today's information economy. To exercise
       influence, you must understand the formal and informal structure of your organization. Again,
       you might need to use influencing when you are dealing with any aspect of the project--for
       example, controlling changes to the project, negotiating schedule or resource assignments,
       resolving conflicts, and the like.
                       PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                  Chapter 1           25


   Leadership. In the traditional organizational structure, project managers do not have formal
   authority over the project team members who perform the teamwork. So you have no other
   choice than to manage by leadership and not by authority (power). The good news is that
   managing by leadership is overall more effective and productive than managing by authority
   anyway. A project team is generally a group of individuals coming together for the lifetime of
   the project from different functional groups with different skills and experience. They need a
   leader to show them the vision and to excite, inspire, and motivate them toward the goals and
   the objectives of the project. You, the project manager, are that leader.
   The Golden Triplet. PMI recommends that in addition to the skills related to application areas
   and management, an effective project manager must have the following three characteristics:
     1. Knowledge. That is, knowledge of project management.
     2. Performance. The ability to use the knowledge to perform the project--that is, to
        make accomplishments and get the job done.
     3. Personal. This relates to the behavior of the project manager while performing the
        project and the related activities. This includes personal effectiveness, attitude, and
        leadership.

   In other words, an effective project manager uses personal abilities, such as a positive attitude
   and leadership skills, to apply project management knowledge effectively in order to lead the
   project to success.
   Different organizations have different attitudes and policies toward project management. The
   structure of the performing organization has a big influence on your job as a project manager.



Organizational Influences on Projects
   A project is typically performed inside an organization called the performing organization, which
   creates an environment for the project called the project environment. The projects are influ-
   enced by the project environment, which is shaped by many elements, such as organizational
   culture, organizational structure, enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets,
   and the maturity of the organization.


Understanding the Organizational Culture
   Each organization often develops its own unique culture, which depends on many factors,
   such as the application area of the organization and the general management philosophy imple-
   mented in the organization. The organizational culture includes the following elements:
           Work environment. The organizational culture is reflected by work ethic and work
           hours. For example, do the employees work strictly from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, or
           do they work late into the night and on weekends?
26   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


               Management style. Organizational culture also reflects authority relationships. Do
               the managers manage by authority or by leadership? How much feedback is taken
               from the employees in making management decisions? How do the employees view
               the authority of the management?
               Policies. The organizational policies, methods, and procedures also reflect the orga-
               nizational culture.
               Values and vision. A significant part of organizational culture lives in the set of val-
               ues, norms, beliefs, and expectations shared within the organization. This may be
               impacted by the organization's mission and vision. For example, a nonprofit organi-
               zation will have different values than a for-profit organization. Furthermore, one
               organization may encourage an entrepreneurial approach while another organization
               may be rigidly hierarchical and take an authoritarian approach to making decisions
               about what to do and what not to do.
       Organizational culture influences multiple aspects of a project, including the following:
               Project selection. The organizational culture will creep into the selection criteria for
               projects and programs. For example, a rigidly hierarchical and authoritarian organi-
               zation may not be very adaptive to programs and projects with high risk.
               Project management style. The project manager should adapt the management
               style to the organizational culture. For example, an authoritarian style may run into
               problems in an entrepreneurial organization with a participative culture.
               Team performance assessments. While making the team performance assessment,
               the project manager should keep in mind the established norms and expectations
               within the organization.
               Project policies and procedures. The project policies and procedures will be influ-
               enced by the organizational policies and procedures because both should be consis-
               tent with each other.
       The culture of an organization is greatly influenced by its structure. From the perspective of a
       project, there are two kinds of organizations: project-based and non-project-based. The pro-
       ject-based organizations fall into two subcategories--those that derive their revenue primarily
       from performing projects for others and those that do in-house projects to deliver products or
       services for customers. Project-based organizations are well aware of the importance of project
       management and generally have systems to support project management. Non-project-based
       organizations generally have a low appreciation for and understanding of the importance of
       project management and often lack systems to support project management. By systems, I mean
       tools and facilities specialized or suitable for performing project management effectively, such
       as project management information systems.
       The point here is that the type of organization and the organizational structure have a great
       influence on how the projects will be managed inside the organization.
                       PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                      Chapter 1            27


Understanding the Organizational Structure
   To do your job efficiently and effectively, you must figure out what kind of organizational struc-
   ture you are in. From the perspective of structure, organizations fall into three categories--func-
   tional organizations, projectized organizations, and matrix organizations.


   Functional Organizations
   A functional organization has a traditional organizational structure in which each functional
   department, such as engineering, marketing, and sales, is a separate entity. As shown in Figure
   1.3, the members of each department (staff ) report to the functional manager of that depart-
   ment, and the functional manager in turn reports to an executive, such as the chief executive
   officer (CEO). Depending on the size of the organization, there could be a hierarchy within
   the functional managers--for example, directors of engineering, QA, and IT operations report-
   ing to the vice president (VP) of engineering, who in turn reports to the CEO.




       FIGURE 1.3 Structure of a functional organization. Gray boxes represent staff involved in a project.

   The scope of a project in a functional organization is usually limited to the boundaries of the
   functional department. Therefore, each department runs its projects largely independent of
   other departments. When a communication needs to occur between two departments, it is
   carried through the hierarchy of functional managers.
   All the managerial power (authority) in a functional organization is vested in the functional
   managers, who control the team members' performance evaluations, salaries, bonuses, hiring,
   and firing. Their role limited to coordinating the project activities, project managers are held
   responsible for the project results even though they have little say over resource assignments
   and holding team members accountable for their work. As a result, project managers in a func-
   tional organization are often frustrated. Their work is, at best, challenging. You, as a project
28   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


       manager in a functional organization, can benefit greatly from your good relationships with
       functional managers and team members. Networking and leadership are the key points to your
       success in a functional organization.
       A project manager in a functional organization has the following attributes:
               The project manager's role and the project team are part-time.
               There is little or no authority over anything: resource assignments, team members,
               and the like.
               The project manager reports directly to a functional manager.
               There is little or no administrative staff to help with the project.


                      NOTE
               In functional organizations, project management might be conducted under other
               names, such as project coordinator or team leader.


       On the other end of the spectrum is the projectized organization.


       Projectized Organization
       A projectized organization's structure is organized around projects. Most of the organization's
       resources are devoted to the projects. As shown in Figure 1.4, the project team members report
       directly to the project manager, who has a great deal of independence and authority. Along with
       responsibility comes the high level of autonomy over the projects. The project managers are
       happy campers in a projectized organization. A functional organization and a projectized
       organization are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of a project manager's authority.
       A project manager in a projectized organization has the following attributes:
               The project manager is full-time.
               The project manager has full authority over the project team.
               There is full-time administrative staff to help with the project.
       In the middle of the spectrum are the matrix organizations.


       Matrix Organization
       A matrix organization is organized into functional departments, but a project is run by a pro-
       ject team, with members coming from different functional departments, as shown in Figure 1.5.
       On the spectrum of a project manager's authority, matrix organizations are in the middle of two
       extremes: functional and projectized organizations. The matrix organizations are generally cat-
       egorized into a strong matrix, which is closer to projectized structure; a weak matrix, which is
       closer to functional structure; and a balanced matrix, which is in the middle of strong and weak.

   We have explored the three basic organizational structures. In the real world, some organiza-
   tions use a hybrid (mix) of these structures to meet their varied needs. For example, a func-
   tional organization may run a specific project just like it would be run in a projectized
   organization. Such organizations are called composite organizations.
   Obviously, organizational structure and organizational culture heavily determine the project
   environment. Two other important factors that influence the project environment are enter-
   prise environmental factors and organizational process assets.

Identifying Environmental Factors and Process Assets
   While exploring the environment of the performing organization, you should also identify the
   environmental factors and the process assets that will influence your project. Some of these
   assets and factors can be used to help the project; others may have a negative influence.

   Enterprise Environmental Factors
   The enterprise environmental factors are related to the environment internal or external to the
   performing organizations and can potentially impact the project. They may originate from
   within the performing organization, from any external organization participating in the pro-
   ject, or from both. These factors may have positive or negative influence on the project, and
   some of these factors may give rise to constraints for the project. Organizational environmen-
   tal factors include the following:
        Culture and structure. These refer to the culture and type of structure of the per-
        forming organization.
        Processes and standards. Here are some examples:
         The organization may have specific processes in place do certain things in certain
            ways.
         There may be government and industry standards to follow, such as legal
            requirements, product standards, and quality standards relevant to the project.
         Personnel administration information, such as guidelines for hiring, firing, and
            performance reviews.
        Infrastructure and resources. These may include the following:
         Facilities and equipment to do the project
         Project management information systems, such as software tools for scheduling
            tasks and meetings
         Human resources currently available in the organization, such as skills and
            expertise
         Commercial databases, such as standardized cost estimating data and risk databases
         Work authorization system of the organization, because the project needs to be
            authorized
         Communication channels and tools available in the organization, such as email
            systems
32   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


               Internal and external conditions. Examples include:
                Risk tolerances of the project stakeholders
                Marketplace conditions relevant to the project
                Political climate
       Note that the environmental factors can be internal to the performing organization, such as
       the organization's culture, or external to the organization, such as market conditions.


       Organizational Process Assets
       These are the processes or process-related assets from any of the organizations involved in the
       project that can be used to help the project succeed. The organizational process assets are typ-
       ically grouped into two categories: processes and procedures for conducting work, and a cor-
       porate knowledge base for storing and retrieving information. For example, the performing
       organization might have its own guidelines, policies, and procedures, whose effect on the pro-
       ject must be considered while developing the project charter and other project documents that
       will follow. Another example of an organization's process assets are the knowledge and learn-
       ing base acquired from previous projects. In the following list, I'll describe some items from
       both categories: processes and procedures and the knowledge database.
       Processes and procedures. This category includes processes, procedures, guidelines, and
       requirements as described in the following:
               Standardized processes and procedures. Examples are organizational-level policies,
               such as health and safety policies, ethics policies, project management policies, and
               quality policies and procedures, such as quality checklists and auditing processes.
               Standard guidelines and criteria. Examples are:
                Project closure guidelines, project acceptance criteria, proposal evaluation criteria,
                   performance measurement criteria, and so on
                Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the standardized organizational processes for
                   the purposes of the project
               Templates. Examples are the templates to support some project management tasks,
               such as risk management, project schedule network diagrams, and work breakdown
               structure.
               Requirements. Examples are:
                Communication requirements, hiring requirements, and safety and security
                   requirements
                Guidelines and requirements for project closures, such as final mandatory project
                   audits and product acceptance criteria

    You need to follow these guidelines and accommodate the requirements while working out the
    details of the project management processes that you will perform.
    Knowledge base. This category includes databases, which allow you to store information and
    to retrieve the stored information when needed. Here are some items in this category:
          Project files. The documents and files related to the project, such as the project
          charter and the scope statement.
          Measurement database. Examples are the performance measurements.
          Historical information and lessons learned. Archives of files from previous projects
          and lessons learned from them.
          Issue and defect management. Database that allows you to manage issues and
          defects, such as to log, control, and resolve an issue or defect. You can also find the
          status of the issue or the defect from this database.
          Financial database. The financial information related to the project, such as budget,
          work hours, and cost overruns.
          Configuration management database. This contains the change history: different
          versions and baselines for the company standards and policies and for the archived
          project documents.


Study Checkpoint 1.4
What is the core difference between enterprise environmental factors and organizational process
assets?



    In a nutshell, enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets contribute to
    the project environment in addition to the organizational culture and organizational structure.


                 NOTE
          Enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets are common
          input to many project management processes. Sometimes they can also appear as
          output from a process, such as archived documents and lessons learned.



    Once you enter the field of project management, you will immediately run into two neighbors
    of a project: program and portfolio.
34    Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT



     Triangular Relationship: Project,
     Program, and Portfolio
        As a project manager, you should know the basic concepts of program and portfolio and how
        they are related to each other and to projects. A program may be a part of a higher-level pro-
        gram; it certainly contains some interrelated projects, and it may contain some non-project
        work. Program management focuses on optimally managing the interdependencies among
        the projects in the program. To that end, the program manager's responsibilities include the
        following:
                Prioritize to resolve resource conflict and constraints that affect multiple projects
                within the program.
                Keep your priorities aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization.
                Resolve issues and manage change within the governance structure of the
                organization.
        Just like a project is managed by a project manager, a program is managed by a program man-
        ager, who oversees the projects and provides high-level guidance to the project managers. In
        other words, a program manager oversees projects and coordinates efforts between projects but
        does not manage the projects: the project managers manage the projects. A portfolio contains
        both programs and projects and is managed by a portfolio manager. The portfolio is drawn
        directly from the strategic business plan of the organization.
        The strategy of an organization is an action plan to achieve its business goals and objectives.
        It's also called a strategic plan or a strategic business plan. The strategy determines the portfolio
        of projects and programs that the organization will execute. A portfolio is a set of projects,
        programs, or both that is managed in a coordinated fashion to obtain control and benefits not
        available from managing them individually.
        Portfolio management is the centralized management of one or more portfolios, and it includes
        identifying, prioritizing, authorizing, managing, and controlling projects, programs, and other
        related work in order to obtain specific strategic business objectives. Just as a program is man-
        aged by a program manager, a portfolio is managed by a portfolio manager.
        To understand the relationship of a portfolio to projects and programs, note the following:
                If an organization does not have any programs but has only individual projects, all
                these projects can be grouped into one or more portfolios.
                If an organization has programs and no individual project external to all programs,
                all these programs can be grouped into one or more portfolios.
                If an organization has some programs and some individual projects, all these pro-
                grams and projects can be grouped into one or more portfolios.
        Portfolio management focuses on making sure that programs and projects are prioritized for
        resources to serve the organization's strategy. Therefore, investment decisions are usually made
        at the portfolio level. Program management focuses on achieving the benefits that would be
                   PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                    Chapter 1        35


aligned with the portfolio and hence with the strategic objectives of the organization. So, a
portfolio is part of the interface between the programs and strategic business objectives of the
organization for which the programs are run.


             NOTE
      Information typically flows from a program to its projects during early stages (or
      phases), such as initiating and planning, and from projects to program during later
      stages, such as executing, controlling, and closing.



The triangular relationship among portfolios, programs, and projects is shown in Figure 1.6,
in which an arrow represents containment. As the figure illustrates, all portfolios are composed
of programs, projects, or both. A program consists of only projects and not portfolios. The fig-
ure also illustrates that both a program and a portfolio can have projects. That means a project
may have a membership in a portfolio directly or through a program.
As compared to projects and programs, a portfolio is closer to an organization's business objec-
tives, and therefore this is where most of the investment decisions are made. If you want to
learn about an organization's business intent and direction (or strategy), look at its portfolio.

36      Part I       INITIATING THE PROJECT


          It's also important to note that an operation is not part of a project. However, a program can
          include a non-project work. Similarly, a portfolio can also include work that is not included in
          any of its constituent projects and programs.
          Table 1.6 presents a comparison between some characteristics of a project, a program, and a
          portfolio.

          You have learned how the five process groups (the different stages in the project lifecycle) and
          the nine project management knowledge areas constitute the project management framework.
          The actual implementation of project management is greatly influenced by the facts on the
          ground--the organizational structure, for example. Throughout the book, you will be explor-
          ing the details of project management, and, therefore, getting introduced to some advanced
          concepts up front will make that journey more pleasant and smoother.



     Some Advanced Concepts
          Throughout this book, you will be encountering concepts such as probability, baseline, project
          team, and project management team. Those concepts are introduced in the following sections.


     Probability-Related Concepts
          The theory of probability has its early seventeenth-century roots in the investigations of games
          of chance, such as roulette and cards. Since then, a multitude of mathematicians and scientists
          have contributed to the development of the theory of probability. Today, the concepts of prob-
          ability appear in almost every discipline, ranging from physics to project management. Risk
          (an important aspect of a project) and probability have the same origin: uncertainty. In project
          management, there is always an important question: What is the probability of this risk to
          occur? In the modern age, probability has already entered into the folk psyche through phrases
          such as, "What are the odds that this will happen?"

       Probability. Probability is defined as a chance that something will happen. For example, when
       you play the lottery and you wonder what the odds are that you will win, you are thinking of
       probability. The simplest example of probability is tossing a coin. The question is, when you
       toss a coin, what is the probability that the coin will land heads up? When you toss a coin,
       there are only two possibilities: It will land either heads up or tails up. Each possibility is equally
       likely if you are not cheating. Therefore, the probability that the coin will land heads up is 1
       out of 2, or 50 percent, or 0.5. In general, if there are n possible outcomes of an event, and each
       outcome is equally likely, then the probability of a specific outcome is 1/n.
       Another useful concept in probability is the combined probability of several events. For exam-
       ple, if you toss two coins, the probability that the first coin will land heads up and the second
       coin will land tails up is 0.5x0.5=0.25. In general, to calculate the combined probability, you
       multiply the individual probabilities. If the probability that an event X will happen is a, the
       probability that event Y will happen is b, and the probability that event Z will happen is c,
       then the probability that all the three events (X, Y, and Z) will happen is axbxc. To summa-
       rize, the probability that a number of independent events will occur is calculated by multiply-
       ing the probabilities of occurrence of all the individual events.
       Random variable. A random variable can acquire any value within a given range or out of a
       set of values. For example, you can use a random variable to represent the results of rolling a
       fair die, which has six sides numbered by dots from 1 to 6. The possible outcome of rolling a
       die could be any number from the set of outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
       Expected value. This is the expected value of an outcome. As an example, assume you get into
       a bet that you will win $10 if a coin toss results in heads, and you will lose $5 if it results in
       tails. Given that the probability for heads or tails is 0.5 for each, the expected value for the
       money that you will win is $10x0.5=$5, and the expected value for the money that you will
       lose is $5x0.5=$2.5.
       Variance. The variance of a random variable is the deviation from the expected value. It is com-
       puted as the average squared deviation of each number from its mean. For example, assume
       that the values of a random variable are 2, 4, 5, 7, and 2 in five measurements. The mean value
       for these measurements is:
                (2+4+5+7+2)/5=4
       The variance of the spread of these values is:
                V=2=[(2-4)2+(4-4)2+(7-4)2+(2-4)2]/5=3.4
       Standard deviation. This is the square root of the variance--that is, . So, in our example, the
       standard deviation is the square root of 3.4--that is, 1.84.
       Algebraic equations. Project/program management and some questions in the CAPM, PMP,
       and PgMP exams will assume that you can do simple mathematical calculations. You should
       also have a very simple understanding of algebraic equations. You should be able to make sim-
       ple manipulations, such as the following:
                CPI=EV/AC implies EV=CPIxAC
                CV=EV-AC implies EV=AC+CV

Global Project Variables
       There are some significant factors in projects and project management that vary their values
       throughout the project lifecycle. You must keep your eyes on these variables from the very
       beginning of the project:
             Cost and number of team members (staff ). Low in the beginning, maximum when
             the project is being executed, with a rapid drop when the project draws to a close.
             Ability to influence the characteristics of the project product without significantly
             changing the cost. Highest in the beginning and gradually decreases as the project
             progresses.
             Risk and stakeholder influences. Highest in the beginning and decreases as the
             project progresses. This is true about uncertainty, too, as risks arise from uncertainty.

     Baseline
         The project baseline is defined as the approved plan for the cost, schedule, and scope of the
         project. The project performance is measured against this baseline. The project baseline is also
         referred to in terms of its components--cost baseline, schedule baseline, and scope baseline.
         How do you know how the project is performing? You compare the performance against the
         baseline. Approved changes in cost, schedule, and scope will also change the baseline.


     Project Management Office
         The project management office (PMO) refers to an entity in an organization that is responsi-
         ble for providing centralized coordinated management and support for projects in the organi-
         zation. The projects supported by the PMO may or may not be related to one another. Some
         functions of the PMO depend upon the organization. In general, a PMO is an interface
         between the business objectives of the organization and the projects. For example, depending
         on the organization, it may act as a stakeholder in projects and a key decision maker in the
         beginning of any project in order to ensure that the projects consistently support the business
         objectives of the organization. To that end, it may be involved in selecting, prioritizing, allo-
         cating, and managing the project resources.
         A primary function of the PMO is to support project managers in multiple ways, including
         the following:
                 Coaching. Provide coaching, training, mentoring, and oversight.
                 Uniformity and consistency in standards:
                  Identify and develop management methodology, best practices, and standards for
                     the projects.
                  Develop and manage procedures, policies, templates, and other documentation
                     shared by the projects.
                  Audit projects to ensure the compliance of standards, policies, procedures, and
                     templates.
                 Resource management. Manage shared resources across all the projects adminis-
                 tered by the PMO.
                 Communication. Coordinate communication across projects.
         To understand the relationship between the roles of a project manager and the PMO, remem-
         ber the following three things:
                 Scope. A project manager focuses on the objectives of the project, whereas the
                 PMO manages the scope at the program level and handles scope changes at the pro-
                 gram level that may be seen as potential opportunities to meet the strategic business
                 objectives of the organization.
                 Resources. The project manager controls and manages the project resources to best
                 meet the project objectives, whereas the PMO works to optimize the use of project
                 resources across all the projects.
                         PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                   Chapter 1        41


          Project aspects. The project manager handles aspects (or constraints) such as cost,
          quality, risk, and schedule specific to the individual project, whereas the PMO man-
          ages the interdependencies among the projects and the organization-level standards,
          such as project management methodologies, policies, and procedures.
    In this chapter, you have been introduced to many concepts in order to build a high-level big
    picture of project management.



Big Picture of Project Management
    In this chapter, you have learned what project management is and how project management is
    performed by applying knowledge and skills to project activities in order to meet the project
    objectives. Applying knowledge boils down to performing processes.
    Figure 1.7 shows the big picture of project management in terms of project, processes, project
    lifecycle in terms of project stages, and project aspects managed by different knowledge
    areas. There are nine important aspects of projects, and each of these nine aspects is managed
    by using the corresponding knowledge area. For example, cost is managed by using the cost
    management knowledge area, and communication is managed by using the communication




 FIGURE 1.7 The big picture of project management: The aspects of a project that need to be managed at
               different stages of the project lifecycle by using processes.

        management knowledge area. So, project management is performed by applying processes from
        certain knowledge areas at certain stages of the project.
        The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
                The project lifecycle consists of five stages, technically called process groups: initiat-
                ing, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. These process groups
                can be mapped to commonly known project stages: starting, organizing and prepar-
                ing, carrying out the work, and closing.
                The project processes that are performed to manage projects constitute nine project
                management knowledge areas: communication management, cost management,
                human resource management, integration management, procurement management,
                quality management, risk management, scope management, and time management.
                A project is performed in a project environment that is shaped by many elements,
                such as organizational culture, organizational structure, enterprise environmental fac-
                tors, organizational process assets, and the maturity of the organization.



     Summary
        The activities inside an organization are generally organized into groups, which fall into two
        categories--operations and projects. Operations usually consist of ongoing routine work,
        whereas a project has a goal to generate a unique product, service, or result in a finite time--
        that is, it has a planned beginning and a planned end. Organizations launch projects for dif-
        ferent reasons, such as to meet a business or legal requirement or to take on an opportunity
        offered by the market. The underlying motivation behind taking on these opportunities, how-
        ever, is the business strategy of the organization. A project, like anything else in an organiza-
        tion, needs to be managed. Project management is the application of knowledge and skills to
        project activities in order to meet the project objectives. It involves performing a set of processes
        that constitute nine knowledge areas of project management: communication management, cost
        management, human resource management, integration management, procurement manage-
        ment, quality management, risk management, scope management, and time management. Each
        process is part of a knowledge area and has a membership in one of five process groups: initi-
        ating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. The process groups represent
        different stages of a project lifecycle.
        Each project has a set of individuals or organizations that it influences positively or negatively,
        and these individuals and organizations are accordingly called positive and negative stakehold-
        ers. Some of these stakeholders may influence the project. Therefore, you must identify all the
        project stakeholders, positive and negative. The different project stakeholders might have dif-
        ferent and conflicting expectations, which you need to analyze and manage. Besides, each
        project runs in an environment that influences it. This project environment consists of ele-
        ments such as organizational culture, organizational structure, enterprise environmental fac-
        tors, and organizational process assets. The structure of the performing organization could be
        functional, projectized, or matrix. On one end of the spectrum, a project manager is usually
                    PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK                                       Chapter 1          43


part-time and has little or no authority in a functional organization. On the other end, the
project manager is full-time and has high to full authority in a projectized organization. In the
middle of the spectrum are matrix organizations, in which a project manager has low to high
authority. Some organizations have a composite structure, which is a hybrid of these three basic
structures.
A project can be standalone or part of a program, which is a collection of interrelated projects
and possibly non-project work. A project can also be part of a portfolio, which is a collection
of programs, projects, and other related work.
As you learned in this chapter, the first stage of the project lifecycle is initiating. You will start
your journey of project management by exploring the initiating stage in the next chapter.


Exam's Eye View
 Comprehend

  The way PMI views it, the discipline of project management is composed of nine knowledge
     areas: scope management, cost management, human resource management, quality manage-
     ment, risk management, time management, procurement management, communication man-
     agement, and integration management.

  Depending upon the stage of the project lifecycle in which they are executed, the processes are
     grouped into five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and
     closing.

  A process belongs exactly to one knowledge area and one process group, the same input may appear
     in more than one process, and you do not have to perform all the processes in each project.

  A project is run in an environment constituted by organizational structure, organizational cul-
     ture, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.

  The project manager's authority is none to little in a functional organization, limited to high in
     a matrix organization, and high to full in a projectized organization.

 Look Out

  For a work effort to be qualified as a project, it must be temporary (that is, have a start and a
     finish), and the outcome must be a unique product, result, or service. Routine, ongoing work is
     an operation, not a project.

  Any individual or organization that is positively or negatively affected by a project is a project
     stakeholder. Stakeholders can exist outside of the performing organization.

  You must identify both positive and negative stakeholders of your project, and you must not
     ignore the negative stakeholders.
44    Part I         INITIATING THE PROJECT



          In a weak matrix, the role of a project manager is more of a coordinator or an expediter; in a
               strong matrix, the project manager may have considerable authority and his or her role may be
               very close to a true project manager.

          Regardless of the structure of the performing organization, project managers are responsible
               for the project results.

          A project may vary in size, it may be few days long or it may be few months long, and it may
               involve one person or quite a few individuals.

          A project may or may not be part of a program, but a program always consists of projects.
          A program may contain related work that is not part of any constituent project.

         Memorize

          Nine knowledge areas and five process groups listed under Comprehend.
          There are four kinds of organizational structures: Functional, matrix, projectized, and composite.
          Knowledge, performance, and personal abilities are the three kinds of characteristics necessary
               for a project manager to effectively manage projects.

          In functional organizations, project management might be conducted under other names, such
               as project coordinator or team leader.

          Process groups are not a project phases.



     Key Terms and Definitions
                enterprise environmental factors. Factors internal or external to the performing
                organization that can influence the project's success, such as the organization's cul-

       B. Staffing levels and the ability to influence the product characteristics are both
            low at the end of the project.
       C. When the project is executing, both cost and stakeholders' influence are at their
            highest.
       D. Uncertainty is at its highest in the beginning of the project.

10.   Both projects and operations share all the following characteristics except:

      trative system, including registration and payment; marketing the courses on the
      website; integrating different components of the website; and finally going live. Each
      component is functionally complex and large enough that it will be better served
      under a different management." The manager is most likely describing a:

        12.   Effective project management requires that a project manger must have the following
              characteristics:
               A. Project management knowledge, ability to apply the knowledge effectively to
                    the project at hand, and computer expertise
               B. Project management knowledge, leadership skills, and expertise in the applica-

Introduction
  As you learned in the previous chapter, you manage projects through processes. You also learned
  that a process is composed of input, tools and techniques, and output. You use the tools and
  techniques on the input of a process to generate its output. You manage the initiation of a pro-
  ject through a process group called the initiating process group, which consists of two processes:
  Develop Project Charter and Identify Stakeholders. Before you can initiate a project, it must
  originate from somewhere.
  So the central question in this chapter is, how is a project initiated? In search of the answer,
  you will explore three avenues with me: the origin and selection of projects, developing the pro-
  ject charter, and identifying stakeholders.



Initiating a Project: Big Picture
  Initiating a project means defining the project, getting approval to start it, and identifying and
  analyzing project stakeholders. During this stage the initial scope of the project is defined;
  accordingly, initial resources are determined and allocated, a project manager with an appro-
  priate authority level is assigned, and project stakeholders are identified. Defining the project
  includes the following:
       Developing project objectives and describing how they are related to the organiza-
       tion's business objectives and strategy.
       Specifying the project deliverables, such as products, services, or results, that will
       meet the objectives. In some cases, a deliverable and an objective may be the same.
       Based on the objectives and deliverables, defining the initial scope of the project by
       explaining what will be done and drawing boundaries around what will be done; this
       means stating where necessary what will not be included.
       Based on the initial scope, estimating the project duration and the resources needed.
       More accurate estimates will be made during planning.
       Defining the success criteria, which may be improved during planning. The project
       definition is incomplete without defining its success.
       Assigning the initial project resources. For example, some initial resources are
       needed just to define and plan the project before even beginning to execute it.
       Assigning a project manager if one is not already assigned.
       Authorizing the project. While different organizations may have a different process
       to approve the processes, the standard way to do it is to approve the document that
       holds the definition of the project, such as the project charter.
                                           INITIATING THE PROJECT                    Chapter 2          51



             CAUTION
      The processes in the initiating process group, just like any other process group, can
      also be used to initiate a phase of a project that has multiple phases.



Based on the project definition, you will identify the project stakeholders.
Figure 2.1 presents the big picture of initiating a project by illustrating the relationships
among major elements of this stage. The business need to be met by the project emerges from
the organization's business strategy, and based on the business need, somebody writes the
statement of work and makes the business case. The business case and statement of work are
the starting points to develop the initial project scope and thereby determine the initial
resources. All this information becomes input to developing the project charter, which, in turn,
is an input to the process of identifying stakeholders.

                   initiating a project.
52    Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT




                       TIP
                It's a good policy to involve customers and other important stakeholders in the initiat-
                ing stage of the project. It gives them the feeling of shared ownership that will greatly
                contribute to the success of the project by positively influencing factors such as deliv-
                erable acceptance and stakeholder satisfaction.




                      NOTE
                If your project is divided into different phases, you will be going through the initiation
                stage at the beginning of each phase to check whether the decisions and plans made
                during the initiation of the project are still relevant to this phase. It helps to ensure
                that the project is still focused on the business need for which it was started.



        Included in Figure 2.1 are two processes performed during the initiating stage: Develop Pro-
        ject Charter and Identify Stakeholders. We will explore all these processes in detail further on
        in this chapter. However, before you can begin the project initiation, someone must request the
        project. So let's back up a little and ask a fundamental question: Where do projects originally
        come from?



     Origins of Projects
        Projects often originate from sources external to the project, such as a sponsor, project man-
        agement office, or portfolio steering committee--internally or externally, by an enterprise or a
        government agency. A project may originate as a result of one or more of the following cate-
        gories of reasons:
                Business/legal requirements. This category includes projects based on a business
                need or a legal requirement. For example, perhaps a web design company authorizes
                a project to automate certain aspects of maintaining websites to increase its effi-
                ciency and revenue. As another example, consider a building owner authorizing a
                project to make the building accessible to physically disabled persons in order to
                meet the legal requirements for using the building for a specific business.
                Opportunities. The projects that fall into this category might include the following:
                 Those based on the market demand. For example, a car manufacturer begins a
                    project to make electric cars based on high oil prices that the customer cannot
                    afford.
                 Those based on a customer request. For example, one of the customers of your
                    company requests a product that could be a source of revenue for the company.
                                          INITIATING THE PROJECT                    Chapter 2           53


         Strategic opportunity/business need. A project that helps implement the business
            strategy of the organization. However, all other opportunities taken by the orga-
            nization must also be aligned with the business strategy.
         Those based on a technological advance. For example, several electronics compa-
            nies authorized projects to manufacture MP3 players following the invention and
            popularity of MP3 technology.
        Problems. Projects are also authorized to offer solutions to certain problems in a
        company or a country or to address social needs in a society. For example, the gov-
        ernment might start a project to help victims of a natural disaster, such as a hurri-
        cane. A company might authorize a project to analyze the problem of low employee
        productivity and to design a solution for this problem.
        Ecological impact. For example, a company undertakes a project to lessen the nega-
        tive impact that its operations or products may have on the environment.
        Social needs. Governmental or nongovernmental organizations initiate projects to
        satisfy some social needs, such as a project to provide access to the Internet in an
        underprivileged community or a project to set up latrines and a sewer system in a
        remote community. These kinds of projects based on social needs are often run by
        nonprofit organizations. Even if not for profit, the projects in such organizations are
        also linked to the business needs of the organization because in order to perform the
        projects, the organization must survive, and in order to survive, the organization
        must work according to its strategic business plan.
   The sources of project requests can vary widely in different organizations. Depending upon
   your organization, the origins of projects might be inside the organization, outside the organi-
   zation, or both. Regardless of these sources, an organization performs a project to meet some
   business objectives in the organization's strategic plan. So the strategic plan of an organization
   is still the grand origin of all projects.
   So, a project can originate from multiple possible sources. Not all requested projects are autho-
   rized by the organization, however. How does an organization decide which projects to select?



Understanding Project Selection
   The underlying motivation behind project selection is the business strategy of the organiza-
   tion. That said, a project can be selected by using one or more project selection methods that
   fall into three categories: benefit measurement methods, constrained optimization methods,
   and expert judgment.


Benefit Measurement Methods
   These methods use comparative approaches to compare the benefits obtained from the candi-
   date projects so that the project with the maximum benefit will be selected. These methods fall
   into three categories: scoring models, benefit contributions, and economic models.
54   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


       Scoring Models
       A scoring model evaluates projects by using a set of criteria with a weight (score) assigned to
       each criterion. You can assign different weights to different criteria to represent the varied
       degree of importance given to various criteria. All projects are evaluated (scored) against this
       set of criteria, and the project with the maximum score is selected. The set of criteria can include
       both objective and subjective criteria, such as financial data, organizational expertise, market
       value, innovation, and fit with the corporate culture. The advantage of a scoring model is that
       you have the freedom to assign different weights to different criteria in order to select projects
       consistent with the goals, mission, and vision of your corporation. This freedom, however, is
       also a disadvantage because your selection is only as good as the criteria with larger weights.
       Furthermore, developing a good scoring model is a difficult task that requires unbiased cross-
       departmental feedback from different levels of the organization.


       Benefit Contributions
       These methods are based on comparing the benefit contributions from different projects. These
       contributions can be estimated by performing a cost-benefit analysis, which typically calcu-
       lates the projected cost, revenue, and savings of a project. This method favors the projects that
       create profit in the shortest time and ignores the long-term benefits of projects that might not
       be tangible at the current time, such as innovation and strategic values.


       Economic Models
       An economic model is used to estimate the economic efficiency of a project, and it involves a
       set of calculations to provide overall financial data about the project. The common terms
       involved in economic models are explained in the following list.
               Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR). This is the value obtained by dividing the benefit by the
               cost. The greater the value, the more attractive the project is. For example, if the
               projected cost of producing a product is $20,000, and you expect to sell it for
               $60,000, then the BCR is equal to $60,000/$20,000, which is equal to 3. For the
               benefit to exceed cost, the BCR must be greater than 1.
               Cash flow. Whereas cash refers to money, cash flow refers to both the money com-
               ing in and the money going out of an organization. Positive cash flow means more
               money is coming in than going out. Cash inflow is benefit (income), and cash out-
               flow is cost (expenses).
               Internal Return Rate (IRR). This is just another way of interpreting the benefit
               from the project. It looks at the cost of the project as the capital investment and
               translates the profit into the interest rate over the life of that investment. Calcula-
               tions for IRR are outside the scope of this book. Just understand that the greater the
               value for IRR, the more beneficial the project is.
               Present Value (PV) and Net Present Value (NPV). To understand these two con-
               cepts, understand that one dollar today can buy you more than what one dollar next
               year can buy. (Think about inflation and return.) The issue arises because it takes
                                            INITIATING THE PROJECT                    Chapter 2           55


           time to complete a project, and even when a project is completed, its benefits are
           reaped over a period of time, not immediately. In other words, the project is costing
           you today but will benefit you tomorrow. So, to make an accurate calculation for the
           profit, the cost and benefits must be converted to the same point in time. The NPV
           of a project is the present value of the future cash inflows (benefits) minus the pre-
           sent value of the current and future cash outflows (cost). For a project to be worth-
           while economically, the NPV must be positive. As an example, assume you invest
           $300,000 today to build a house, which will be completed and sold after three years
           for $500,000. Also assume that real estate that is worth $400,000 today will be
           worth $500,000 after three years. So the present value of the cash inflow on your
           house is $400,000, and hence the NPV is the present value of the cash inflow minus
           the present value of the cash outflow, which equals $400,000-$300,000, which
           equals $100,000.
           Opportunity cost. This refers to selecting a project over another due to the scarcity
           of resources. In other words, by spending this dollar on this project, you are passing
           on the opportunity to spend this dollar on another project. How big an opportunity
           are you missing? The smaller the opportunity cost, the better it is.
           Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). The discounted cash flow refers to the amount that
           someone is willing to pay today in anticipation of receiving the cash flow in the
           future. DCF is calculated by taking the amount that you anticipate to receive in the
           future and discounting (converting) it back to today on the time scale. This conver-
           sion factors in the interest rate and opportunity cost between now (when you are
           spending cash) and the time when you will receive the cash back.
           Return on Investment (ROI). The ROI is the percentage profit from the project.
           For example, if you spend $400,000 on the project, and the benefit for the first year
           is $500,000, then ROI equals ($500,000-$400,000)/$400,000, which equals 25%.
      The details and calculations for these quantities are outside the scope of this book. Just under-
      stand the basic concepts and whether a larger or a smaller value for a given quantity favors the
      project selection.

56     Part I       INITIATING THE PROJECT


         As the name suggests, all the benefit measurement methods are based on calculating some
         kind of benefit from the given project. However, the benefit will never be realized if the pro-
         ject fails. This concern has given rise to methods based on calculating the success of the pro-
         jects; these methods are called constrained optimization methods.


     Constrained Optimization Methods
         Constrained optimization methods are concerned with predicting the success of the project.
         These methods are based on complex mathematical models that use formulae and algorithms
         to predict the success of a project. These models use the following kinds of algorithms:
                   Linear
                   Nonlinear
                   Dynamic
                   Integer
                   Multiple objective programming



                       TIP
                For the exam, you need to know two things about constrained optimization methods:
                the names of the types of algorithms and the fact that these methods are only used
                for complex projects and therefore are not typically used for most projects.



         The details of these models are outside the scope of this book.
         Either in conjunction with other methods or in absence of them, organizations often rely on
         expert judgment in making selection decisions.


     Expert Judgment
         Expert judgment is one of the techniques used in project management to accomplish various
         tasks, including project selection. It refers to making a decision by relying on expert advice from
         one or more of the following sources:
                   Senior management
                   An appropriate unit within the organization
                   The project stakeholders, including customers and sponsors
                   Consultants
                   Professional and technical associations
                                         INITIATING THE PROJECT                     Chapter 2           57


       Industry groups
       Subject matter experts from within or outside of the performing organization
       Project management office (PMO)
  The use of expert judgment is not limited to the project selection; it can be used in many
  processes, such as developing a project charter. Expert judgment can be obtained by using a
  suitable method, such as individual consultation, interview, survey, and panel group discussion.


               CAUTION
        Keep in mind that expert judgment can be very subjective at times and might include
        political influence. An excellent salesperson or an executive with great influence can
        exploit this method successfully.



  An organization might use multiple selection methods to make a decision. During the project
  selection process, you might start interacting with a very important group of people called pro-
  ject stakeholders. For effective identification of stakeholders, you need the project charter.



Developing a Project Charter
  The project charter is a document that states the initial requirements to satisfy the stakehold-
  ers' needs and expectations, and it also formally authorizes the project. The single most impor-
  tant task for the develop project charter process, the standard process used to develop the project
  charter, is to authorize the project. To accomplish that, it is necessary to document the busi-
  ness needs and the new product or service that the project will launch to satisfy those needs.
  This way, the project charter links the proposed project to the ongoing work in the organiza-
  tion and clears the way to authorize the project.


               NOTE
        The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project, which includes
        naming the project manager and determining the authority level of the project man-
        ager. Obviously, we are referring to the approved project charter.



  The output of the Develop Project Charter process is, of course, the project charter, and this
  output is generated by applying the tools and techniques to the input of this process, as shown
  in Figure 2.2.
58   Part I         INITIATING THE PROJECT




              FIGURE 2.2 The Develop Project Charter process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

       The input to developing the project charter comes from the origin of the project and from
       within the organization that will perform the project. The possible input items for the process
       of developing a project charter are the following:
       Business case. The origins of the business case are pretty much the same as the origins of a
       project discussed earlier in this chapter. The business case is built on the business need
       addressed by the project that justifies the project. This will determine whether the project is
       worth the effort and the investment. The business case may contain the cost benefit analysis
       described further on in this chapter. The business case is written by either the person or the
       group within the performing organization that is proposing the project or by an external orga-
       nization or the customer who is requesting the project or the product that will be produced by
       the project.
       If the organization that is requesting the project is a separate legal entity than the organization
       that is performing the project, both may have their own business cases. In this case, the busi-
       ness case that goes into the project is the business case of the performing organization. The
       business case of the requesting organization will make its way to the project through the con-
       tract or the statement of work.



                      TIP
               Periodic reviews of the business case in the early stages of a project help to confirm
               that the project is still required. If the project has multiple phases, the business case
               may be reviewed at the beginning of each phase to ensure that the project is still on
               track to deliver the business benefits.



       Project statement of work (SOW). The statement of work is a document that describes the
       products, services, or results that will be delivered by the project. For an internal project, the
       SOW is provided by the project initiator or the project sponsor, whereas for an external pro-
       ject, the SOW is received from the customer as part of a bid document, such as a request for
                                       INITIATING THE PROJECT                    Chapter 2           59


proposal, a request for bid, or a request for information. Alternatively, it could come as part of
the contract. The SOW includes or refers to the business need that the project will satisfy, the
product scope, and the strategic plan of the organization supported by the project.


             CAUTION
      Do not confuse the project scope with the product scope: These are related though
      different concepts. Product scope is defined as features and functions that character-
      ize a product, service, or result to be delivered by the project, whereas the project
      scope is the scope of the whole project and is defined as the entire work required to
      create the project deliverables.



Enterprise environmental factors. During the development of the project charter, you must
consider the performing organization's environmental factors relevant to this task, which
include the following:
     Government and industry standards, such as legal requirements, product standards,
     and quality standards relevant to the project
     Performing organization's infrastructure, such as facilities and equipment to do the
     project
     Marketplace conditions relevant to the project
Note that the environmental factors can be internal to the performing organization, such as
the organization's culture, or external to the organization, such as market conditions.
Organizational process assets. As you learned in Chapter 1, the organizational process assets
are typically grouped into two categories: processes and procedures for conducting work and
a corporate knowledge base for storing and retrieving information to help the processes. For
example, the performing organization might have its own guidelines, policies, and procedures,
whose effect on the project must be considered while developing the project charter and
other project documents that will follow. Another example of an organization's process assets
are the knowledge and learning base acquired from the previous projects. Here are some spe-
cific examples from the organizational process assets that can be useful in developing the pro-
ject charter:
     Templates to support some project management tasks, such as project charter tem-
     plates
     Standard policies and procedures of the organization relevant to developing the pro-
     ject charter
     Procedures for issuing work authorizations
     The knowledge base of the organization that contains historical information from
     previous projects, such as lessons learned
60   Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


       Contract. A project for a customer who is external to the performing organization is usually
       done based on a contract.
       To summarize, the input items to developing the project charter may include the business
       case, the statement of work, enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, and
       possibly a contract. You take the available input and apply the relevant tools and techniques to
       develop the project charter. The most important tool used in developing the project charter is
       the expert judgment described earlier in this chapter.
       The output of the Develop Project Charter process is a formal document called the project char-
       ter. It is a high-level document that summarizes the business needs, the understanding of cus-
       tomer requirements and needs, and how the new product or service will satisfy these
       requirements. To be specific, the project charter should include the following information.
               The project justification, which includes the purpose of the project and the busi-
               ness case for the project, which in turn may include return on investment.
               A high-level project description that includes the business needs that the project
               addresses and the high-level product requirements.
               High-level project requirements based on the needs of the customer, the sponsor,
               and other stakeholders.
               Project objectives and success criteria, which are derived from the purpose section.
               These explain what exactly is going to be accomplished to meet the purpose--that
               is, what the outcome of the project will be. Each objective should be measurable and
               have a success criterion assigned to it. The project objectives must be measurable.
               High-level risks, which will be identified during the project planning. However,
               some high-level risks may be apparent during the time of developing the project
               charter.
               Milestone schedule--some kind of high-level schedule included in the charter.
               A budget summary. A high-level summary of the project cost estimate with some
               kind of timeline.
               Project approval and acceptance requirements, which include the name and
               responsibility of the person or committee that will approve and accept the project
               when it's finished:
                What constitutes the project success?
                Who decides whether the project is successful?
                Who signs off on the project completion?
               An assigned project manager, a specified authority level for that project manager,
               and defined stakeholder influences.
               Project sponsor--the name and authority level of the project sponsor authorizing
               the project charter.
                                       INITIATING THE PROJECT                     Chapter 2          61


Depending on the project and the organization, the charter may include other elements as well,
such as a list of participating functional departments of the organization and their roles in the
project, and organizational, environmental, and external assumptions and constraints.
An assumption is a factor that you consider to be true without any proof or verification. For
example, an obvious assumption that you might make during planning for an in-house project
could be the availability of the required skill set to perform the project.
It's important to document assumptions clearly and validate them at various stages of the pro-
ject because assumptions carry a certain degree of uncertainty with them, and uncertainty
means risk. Assumptions can appear in both the input and the output of various processes.
A constraint is a restriction (or a limitation) that can affect the performance of the project. It
can appear in both the input and the output of various processes. For example, there could be
a schedule constraint that the project must be completed by a predetermined date. Similarly, a
cost constraint would limit the budget available for the project.
The project charter provides the project manager with the authority to use organizational
resources to run the project. Remember that formally speaking, project charters are prepared
external to project management by an individual or a committee in the organization. In other
words, project management starts where the project charter ends. However, practically, the
would-be project manager might actually be involved in writing the project charter or a part
of it. The project approval and funding will still be external to the project management
boundaries.


             NOTE
      Some organizations might perform a feasibility study or its equivalent to justify the
      project before developing the project charter and initiating the project. The feasibility
      study may itself become a project.



Once you have the project charter, you know the high-level product (or service) requirements
that the project will satisfy. However, a high-level requirement written in a certain way might
mean different things to different stakeholders. So, after you get the project charter, your first
task is to develop a common understanding of the project among the project stakeholders. You
accomplish this by drawing boundaries around the project--that is, what is included and what
is not--thereby spelling out what exactly the deliverables are. By doing this, you are deter-
mining the scope of the project.


             NOTE
      If a project includes multiple phases, the initiation process may be performed at the
      beginning of each phase to validate the assumptions made during the previous phases.
62    Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


        Once the project charter is developed, you are well equipped to identify the project
        stakeholders.



     Identifying the Project Stakeholders
        As mentioned in Chapter 1, project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose inter-
        ests are affected (positively or negatively) by the project's execution and completion. In other
        words, a project stakeholder has something to gain from the project or something to lose to
        the project. Accordingly, the stakeholders fall into two categories: positive stakeholders, who
        will normally benefit from the success of the project, and negative stakeholders, who see some
        kind of disadvantage coming from the project. The implications, obviously, are that the posi-
        tive stakeholders would like to see the project succeed, and the negative stakeholders' interests
        will be better served if the project is delayed or cancelled altogether. For example, your city
        mayor might be a positive stakeholder in a project to open a Walmart store in your neighbor-
        hood because it brings business to the city, whereas some local business leaders might look at
        it as a threat to the local businesses and thereby may act as negative stakeholders.
        Negative stakeholders are often overlooked by the project manager and the project team,
        which increases the project risk. Ignoring positive or negative project stakeholders will have a
        damaging impact on the project. Therefore, it's important that you, as a project manager, start
        identifying the project stakeholders early on in the project. The different project stakeholders
        might have different and conflicting expectations that you need to analyze and manage.
        Identifying all the project stakeholders might be a difficult task, but the obvious ones include
        the project manager, program manager, portfolio manager, customers and users, project spon-
        sor, project management office, project team, operations management, sellers and business part-
        ners, and functional managers. In addition to these key stakeholders, discussed in Chapter 1,
        there can be a number of other less obvious stakeholders inside and outside of your organiza-
        tion. Depending upon the project, these might include investors, sellers, contractors, family
        members of the project team members, government agencies, media outlets, lobbying organi-
        zations, individual citizens, and society at large.
        It is critical for the success of the project that you identify positive and negative stakeholders
        early on in the project, understand and analyze their varying and conflicting expectations, and
        manage those expectations throughout the project.
        Figure 2.3 illustrates the Identify Stakeholders process. Identifying stakeholders includes the
        following:
                Identify individuals and organizations that will influence the project and will be
                impacted by the project.
                Document relevant information about the individuals and organizations and about
                their interests and involvement in the project.
                                           INITIATING THE PROJECT                       Chapter 2         63


         Document how these individuals and organizations can influence the project and
         how they can be impacted by the project.
         Determine their levels of importance.




        FIGURE 2.3 The Identify Stakeholders process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

    As stated earlier, stakeholder identification is necessary in order to manage stakeholder expec-
    tations and to manage their influence on the project. They can influence various aspects of the
    project, such as definition, changes, execution, deliverables, and ultimately the success. They
    may come from inside the organization with different levels of authority or from outside the
    organization.
    Identifying stakeholders is an iterative process--that is, you might have to perform the iden-
    tification over and over again because some old stakeholders may become irrelevant, and some
    new stakeholders may appear during the life of the project. Because identifying and analyzing
    the stakeholders and managing their expectations and influence is so critical to the success of
    the project, you should start this task early on in the project.


Input to Identifying Stakeholders
    The following items are the input to the process of developing stakeholders:
    Project charter. The project charter greatly helps to identify stakeholders by revealing the inter-
    nal and external individuals and groups who either are directly involved in the project or will
    potentially be impacted by it. Project sponsors, customers, and departments of the performing
    organization participating in the project are some examples of stakeholders identified by the
    project charter.
    Procurement documents. If the project originated from procurement activity, then the pro-
    curement documents, such as the contract, will be useful to identify the stakeholders. Even if
    this project is going to use procurement in order to produce part of its product, the procure-
    ment documents will help to identify some stakeholders, such as sellers and suppliers.
64     Part I        INITIATING THE PROJECT


         Enterprise environmental factors. Examples of the enterprise environmental factors that
         help identify stakeholders include governmental and industry standards, organizational cul-
         tures, and organizational structure. It's important to understand the organization's culture and
         structure in order to identify some stakeholders and their possible impact on the project,
         because different people will have different levels of authority and influence under different
         cultures and structures, as discussed in Chapter 1.
         Organizational process assets. The stakeholder register templates and the stakeholder regis-
         ters from previous projects can be useful to create the stakeholder registers for the project at
         hand. Another example of the organizational process assets helpful in identifying stakeholders
         are the lessons learned from previous projects. For instance, you learned from a previous pro-
         ject how you ignored a negative stakeholder that caused great damage to the project.
         You identify stakeholders by applying the tools and techniques discussed in the next section to
         this input.


     Tools and Techniques for Identifying Stakeholders
         The tools and techniques used to identify stakeholders include expert judgment and stakeholder
         analysis. Expert judgment was discussed in a previous section, and stakeholder analysis is dis-
         cussed in an upcoming section in this chapter.


     Output of Identifying Stakeholders
         The output items of the Identify Stakeholders process are the stakeholder register and the
         stakeholder management strategy. The stakeholder management strategy is discussed in an
         upcoming section in this chapter.
         You store information about the stakeholders that you identified in a document called the stake-
         holder register. This information includes the following items:
                 Identification. For example, name, location, organizational position, project role (if
                 any), and contact information.
                 Assessment. Requirements and expectations coming from this stakeholder, the part
                 or the phase of the project that is of most interest to this stakeholder, and assessment
                 of potential influence on the project.
                 Classification. There will be a whole array of different kinds of project stakeholders
                 with varied influence. So it's helpful to classify them by using suitable criteria, such
                 as whether they are internal or external to the performing organization, proponents
                 or opponents of the project, and so on.
         So, the minimum information in the stakeholder register is based on your work: identify, assess,
         and classify. This work is part of what is called stakeholder analysis, a technique used for iden-
         tifying the stakeholders.

Stakeholder Analysis
  Stakeholder analysis is an activity to gather and analyze information about the stakeholders.
  Following are the three major steps in this process:
    1. Identify. Identify in all potential stakeholders the important characteristics of each
       identified stakeholder, such as the following:
         A. Name, department, and role. For example, Dr. John Serri, Vice President,
              Research and Development.
         B. Interest in the project. Why should the stakeholder be interested in the
              project--seeking to benefit or threatened?
         C. Knowledge level. What is the knowledge level of the stakeholder, especially
              about the project and in the application area of the project?
         D. Expectations. What are the expectations of the stakeholder from the project?
         E. Kind and level of influence. In which way and how much can the stakeholder
              influence the project?
    2. Assess. Make an assessment of how a stakeholder is going to react to various situa-
       tions in the project. This will help you prepare to influence them in order to get their
       support to enhance the chances for project success.
    3. Classify. When there are so many stakeholders, it's important for effective stakeholder
       management to classify and prioritize the stakeholders. This will help in efficient use of
       management efforts, including communication and expectations management. For
       example, an obvious classification is positive and negative stakeholders. For more sophis-
       ticated classifications, there are several criteria and models, including the following:
         A. Power/interest grid. In this model you place the stakeholders on a two-
              dimensional plot: authority level versus interest level. For example, if a powerful
              stakeholder has a lot of interest in the project, he is of great priority. If, on the
              other hand, a stakeholder lacks interest in the project--even if he has a lot of
              authority--then he potentially will not influence the project that much.
         B. Power/involvement grid. Also called power/influence grid, this model plots the
              stakeholders in a two-dimensional space: authority level versus involvement in
              the project.
         C. Involvement/impact grid. Also called influence/impact grid, this model plots the
              stakeholders in a two-dimensional space: involvement in the project versus abil-
              ity to impact the project. For example, a project stakeholder may be highly
              involved in the project but have no ability to impact the project, such as influ-
              ence the changes in the project. In that case, this stakeholder is of lower priority
              compared to the stakeholder who has high involvement and high impact.
         D. Salience model. This model classifies stakeholders based on multiple character-
              istics, such as the ability to impose their will (power); the urgency of their
              needs, expectations, or requirements; and the legitimacy of their involvement.

  Based on the stakeholder analysis, you develop the strategy for managing the stakeholders.
66     Part I          INITIATING THE PROJECT



     Stakeholder Management Strategy
          The stakeholder management strategy is the approach developed to deal with the stakehold-
          ers in the best interests of the project. The strategy should include the following elements:
                 Key stakeholders
                 For each stakeholder, level of influence on the project and level of impact on the
                 stakeholder from the project
                 How to manage individual stakeholders
                 How to manage groups of stakeholders
          For example, you can maintain the strategy in a matrix like the one shown in Table 2.1.


     Table 2.1 Example Template for the Stakeholder Management Strategy Matrix
                                                                                          Strategy for
                                        Assessment of    Level of          Positive       Maximizing
                                        Impact of the    Influence of      Stakeholder    Support or

     Stakeholder        the Project     Stakeholder      on the Project    Stakeholder?   Negative Impact




                         TIP
                   The stakeholder management strategy should include both the positive and the nega-
                   tive stakeholders. You should develop and implement the stakeholder management
                   strategy with one goal in mind: to optimize the project success by maximizing the
                   support from the positive stakeholders and minimizing (or mitigating) the damaging
                   impact on the project from the negative stakeholders.



          As mentioned in the previous section, during the analysis you can draw a variable against
          another variable and see where the stakeholders fit in that plot. If the variables are chosen
          carefully, the plot will suggest how much attention should be given to various stakeholders in
          the plot. As an example, Figure 2.4 presents such a plot, in which the X axis represents the
          level of interest from very low to very high, and the Y axis represents the authority level (capa-
          bility of influencing the project) from very low to very high. Stakeholders 1, 2, and 3 have a
          low interest in the project and low power, and therefore they do not deserve much of your time

                  variables.

and effort. However, they must be monitored because the interest and the power may change
over time. On the other extreme, Stakeholders 8, 9, and 10 have a high interest in the project
and a very high capability to influence the project due to high power. Now, these stakeholders
should obviously be managed with maximum effort.


            CAUTION
     Communication of information about the stakeholders is an important part of the
     stakeholder management strategy. For example, some of the information about cer-
     tain stakeholders may be too sensitive to be included in a publicly shared document.
     As a project manager, you must exercise your discreet judgment on which informa-
     tion about which stakeholder can be shared with whom and to what detail.



So, the project charter and the stakeholder register are the two important documents of the
project initiating stage. However, the project does not initiate until the project charter is
approved.

     STUDY CHECKPOINT 2.2
      A. What is the first process you perform in managing a project?
      B. What do you need before you can begin initiating your project?




     Obtaining Project Charter Approval
          The single most important outcome of the project initiation process group is the project char-
          ter approval. In other words, a project is initiated through an approval of the project charter by
          an appropriate person in the performing organization. Who this person is depends on the orga-
          nization and the project. This person, for example, could be the CEO of the company, the pro-
          ject sponsor, or a representative of the project selection committee.
          With the approval of the project charter, the project is officially authorized, the project man-
          ager is officially assigned, and the authority level of the project manager is determined. In
          practice, it does happen that the (future) project manager participates in developing the pro-
          ject charter, but project approval and resource assignments, such as funding, generally happen
          outside the boundaries of project management.

                It's important to realize that approval and funding of a project occurs outside the
                boundaries of the project. However, the project management team may help and be
                involved in writing the project charter.

  In a nutshell, issuing an approved project charter moves the project from the initiating stage
  into the planning stage.
  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
       A project can originate inside the performing organization or outside of it, in
       order to meet business requirements, take on an opportunity, or offer a solution
       to a problem. But the grand origin of a project is always the strategic plan of the
       organization.
       The project charter officially authorizes the project, names the project manager, and
       determines the authority level of the project manager.
       The process of identifying the stakeholders generates the stakeholder register and
       the stakeholder management strategy.



Summary
  Organizations start projects for different reasons, such as to meet a business or legal require-
  ment, to take on a business opportunity, or to develop a solution for a problem. However, the
  underlying motivation is always to meet some business objectives in the strategic plan of the
  organization. Three categories of methods are available to select from the proposed projects.
  The first method is the benefit measurement method, which evaluates the benefits from the
  project. Constrained optimization methods focus on the probability of completing the project
  successfully, and expert judgment relies on expert advice. As a project manager, you need to
  identify each stakeholder: an individual or an organization that is going to gain or lose from
  the successful completion of the project.
  The initiating project stage (also called starting) is constituted by two processes: Develop Pro-
  ject Charter and Identify Stakeholders. The two documents generated by the initiating stage
  are the project charter, which names and authorizes the project manager, and the stakeholder
  register, which identifies the project stakeholders and relevant information about them. Based
  on this information, you develop the stakeholder management strategy. The project charter also
  includes project justification based on the business needs and a high-level description of the
  product or service that the project will offer to meet those business needs.
  Issuing an approved project charter moves the project from the initiation stage into the plan-
  ning stage, which is composed of a number of processes collectively called the planning process
  group. These processes are explored in the next Part of the book.

       Exam's Eye View
        Comprehend

         The project manager and project sponsor are also project stakeholders.
         A contract can be an input item for developing the project charter but not for developing the
              preliminary project scope statement.

         The project charter, which is an output of the Develop Project Charter process, is an input to
              the Identify Stakeholder process.

         The Develop Charter Process needs to be performed before the Identify Stakeholders process
              because the project charter is an input to identifying project stakeholders.

        Look Out

         A contract can be an input item to both the Develop Project Charter process and the Identify
              Stakeholders process. For identifying stakeholders, a contract could be a part of the procure-
              ment documents.

         A project stakeholder is an individual or organization that has anything to gain or lose from
              the successful completion of the project. It could be anyone from the CEO of the performing
              organization to an ordinary citizen.

        Memorize

         Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively or
              negatively) by the project execution and completion.

         The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project, which includes naming
              a project manager.

         Constrained optimization methods used for project selection use these kinds of algorithms: lin-
              ear, nonlinear, dynamic, integer, and multiple objective programming.

         The major output items of project initiating are the project charter, stakeholder register, and
              stakeholder management strategy.

         The project statement of work is an input to the Develop Project Charter process, and not to
              the Identify Stakeholders process.

        Planning
       the Project
     ongratulations, you have already defined your project as described in Part I.
C    You can't wait to begin executing. But hold on! I have a couple of questions for
you. First, when you are executing your project, how will you know that you are on
the right track? Second, during the execution, how will you know that the project
is performing in such a way that it will end in success? To address these two and
other related questions, you will need to do some planning before you begin the
execution. Also, to lead the project to success, you want to monitor and control it
throughout its lifetime. Planning gives you the tools and the framework to do
exactly that--for example, a performance baseline against which you will be mea-
suring the progress of the project, an important part of monitoring and controlling,
is developed during planning. This baseline is comprised of the scope baseline,
schedule baseline, and cost baseline, which are developed during scope, schedule,
and cost planning. You will also need to plan for the resources needed to complete
the project. Furthermore, any management task has a potential of increasing or
decreasing a potential risk. Therefore, all project management is inherently con-
nected to risk management. You need to plan for managing risks, and also quality.
Initiation determines what will be done, whereas planning embraces that what,
refines it, and determines how it will be done.

Introduction
  After the project has been initiated, as discussed in the previous chapter, you need to develop
  a project management plan, which becomes the primary source of information for how the pro-
  ject at hand will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. One component of the pro-
  ject management plan is scope planning, which you will explore in this chapter. The primary
  purpose of project scope management is to ensure that the required work (and only the required
  work) is performed to complete the project successfully. If changes in the work requirements
  are made, they must be controlled--that is, the scope must be controlled.
  Before you start defining the scope, you need to know what the project and product require-
  ments are. In other words, you need to collect requirements based on the needs and expecta-
  tions of the stakeholders. Once you have defined the scope, it needs to be broken down into
  concrete, manageable tasks that can be assigned and performed. This is accomplished through
  what is called the work breakdown structure (WBS).
  In a nutshell, the central issue in this chapter is planning for the project scope. To be able to
  wrap your mind around this issue, you will explore three avenues: collecting requirements,
  defining the project scope, and creating the WBS.



Planning the Project: Big Picture
  Once the project has been initiated, it's time to do some planning. This includes determining
  the project scope, during which time you'll refine the project objectives and determine some
  how-to's: how the scope will be executed, how the execution will be monitored and controlled,
  and how the project will be brought to a proper closure. Project planning is embodied in the
  project management plan that is developed through progressive elaboration, a concept explained
  in Chapter 1. The project management plan is a document that defines, prepares, coordinates,
  and integrates all subsidiary plans, such as scope and risk management plans, into one plan.
  The goal here is to develop a source of information that will work as a guideline for how the
  project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed.
  In this section you will get a bird's-eye view of how different elements of project planning
  integrate into developing the project management plan.
80     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


     Elements of Project Planning
         Project planning means the following three things:
              Refining the project objectives defined during project initiation and collecting
              requirements based on the stakeholder needs and expectations.
              Determining the scope of the project.
              Determining the course of action required to attain these objectives, which involves
              breaking down the scope and objectives into concrete, manageable tasks.
         It is important to plan the project because not all projects need all the planning processes, nor
         do they all need them to the same degree. Therefore, the content of the project management
         plan, the ultimate document developed from project planning, will depend upon a specific
         project. As the project goes through different stages, the project management plan may be
         updated and revised through the change control process. Following is an incomplete list of
         issues that project planning addresses:
              Which project management processes will be used for the project, what the level of
              implementation for each of the processes will be, and what the inputs and tools and
              techniques for the processes are
              The project baseline against which the performance of the project will be measured
              and against which the project will be monitored and controlled
              How the changes to the approved plan will be monitored and controlled
              What the needs and techniques for communication among the stakeholders are
              How the project lifecycle looks, including the project phases if the project is a multi-
              phase one


                       NOTE
                 The project baseline is defined as the approved plan for the scope, schedule, and
                 cost of the project. The project performance is measured against this baseline, and
                 therefore this baseline is also called the performance baseline. The project baseline
                 is also referred to in terms of its components: cost baseline, schedule baseline, and
                 scope baseline. How do you know how the project is performing? You compare the
                 performance to the baseline. Approved changes in scope, schedule, or cost will obvi-
                 ously change the baseline.



         Figure 3.1 presents the big picture of project planning and its relationship with executing. This
         figure and other figures like this only present a high-level view. The details may be more com-
         plex. For example, the project management plan is initially an input to executing but can be
         influenced and changed as a result of execution. Depending upon the complexity of the

       project, the project management plan can be either a summary or a collection of subsidiary
       plans and components, which might include the following:
             Standard plans from different aspects of project planning, such as the cost manage-
             ment plan, communication management plan, scope management plan, and risk
             management plan.
             Other components, such as the milestones list, the resource calendar, and baselines
             for scope, schedule, cost, and quality. A baseline is a reference plan against which all
             the performance deviations are measured. This reference plan can be the original or
             the updated plan.
       In a nutshell, project planning involves determining exactly what will be done and how it will
       be done. Executing a project means implementing the project management plan for that pro-
       ject. Therefore, the project management plan contains the project scope that defines what needs
       to be done to meet the project objectives. But how is the project management plan actually
       developed?
82     Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


     Developing the Project Management Plan
         Once the project has been initiated, it is time to do some planning. Project planning starts
         with the process of developing a project management plan, which defines, prepares, coordi-
         nates, and integrates all subsidiary plans, such as scope and risk management plans, into one
         plan called the project management plan. The goal here is to develop a source of information that
         will work as a guideline for how the project will be planned, executed, controlled, and closed.
         One reason why it is important to develop a project management plan is that not all projects
         need all the planning processes, and to the same degree. Therefore, the content of the project
         management plan will depend upon a specific project. As the project goes through different
         stages, the project management plan may be updated and revised through the change control
         process. Following is an incomplete list of issues that a project management plan addresses.
              Which project management processes will be used for this process, what the level of
              implementation for each of these processes will be, and what the inputs and tools
              and techniques for these processes are
              How the changes will be monitored and controlled
              What the needs and techniques for communication among the stakeholders are
              How the project lifecycle looks, including the project phases if the project is a multi-
              phase project
              The lifecycle selected for the project at hand

         Depending upon the complexity of the project, the project management plan can be either
         a summary or a collection of subsidiary plans and components, which might include the
         following:
              Standard plans from the project planning process group, such as the cost manage-
              ment plan, communication management plan, process scope management plan, and
              risk management plan.

           Some necessary plans, which may not be generated by standard processes, such as a
           change management plan that describes how changes will be monitored and controlled.
           Other components, such as the milestones list, resource calendar, and baselines for
           schedule, cost, and quality. A baseline is a reference plan against which all the per-
           formance deviations are measured. This reference plan can be the original or the
           updated plan.
      The process of developing the project management plan falls in the knowledge area of inte-
      gration management because it coordinates the various processes and activities. Therefore,
      project management processes, in addition to the preliminary project scope statement, are the
      obvious inputs to this process. The other inputs are enterprise environmental factors and orga-
      nizational process assets. To develop the project management plan, you apply the following
      tools and techniques to this input: expert judgment, project management information systems,
      and project management methodology.
      One of the crucial parts of managing any project is scope management, which is discussed next.



Managing Scope
      The scope of a project consists of the project scope and the product scope. The project scope is
      defined as the work that must be performed to deliver the required products, services, or
      results with the specified functions and features. The product scope is the set of functions and
      features that characterize a product, service, or result to be delivered by the project. It is about
      both what is included in the project and what is not. In other words, scoping a project means
      drawing boundaries around it. The importance of managing the project scope cannot be
      overemphasized because it has a profound impact on the overall success of the project.


                   CAUTION
            Project scope is not the same thing as the product scope. Project scope is the work
            required to deliver the product scope.

84     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


     Developing the Project Scope Management Plan
         Before starting to perform the five scope management processes, you develop the scope man-
         agement plan. This work is recommended to be part of the effort of developing the project
         management plan. This plan will work as a guide for handling the following:
              How can you define the scope? To answer this question, the scope management
              plan includes the following:
               A process to prepare a detailed project scope statement based on the preliminary
                  project scope statement.
               A process that will enable the creation of the work breakdown structure (WBS)
                  from the detailed project scope statement and will establish how the WBS will
                  be maintained and approved.
              How can you verify the scope? The scope management plan answers this question
              by including a process that describes how the formal verification and acceptance of
              the completed project deliverables will be obtained.
              How can you control the scope? The scope management plan answers this question
              by including a process that specifies how the requests for changes to the detailed
              project scope statement (which we also refer to as the scope statement) will be
              processed.
         Whether the project scope management plan is informal and high-level (without too much
         detail) or formal and detailed depends upon the size, complexity, and needs of the project.
         The project scope management plan becomes part of the project management plan.


                       CAUTION
                 If you are familiar with the PMBOK Guide, Third Edition, note that there was a
                 process called scope planning to develop the scope management plan. There is no
                 such formal process in the PMBOK Guide, Fourth Edition. You develop the scope
                 management plan as part of the effort of developing the project management plan.



     Project Scope Management: Big Picture
         The major goal of scope management is to ensure that the required work and only the required
         work is included and performed in the project. As shown in Figure 3.3, this goal is accom-
         plished by the following functions of project management:
              Collect requirements. Define the project and product requirements and develop a
              plan to manage those requirements. This will help clarify what needs to be done.
              Define scope. Develop a detailed description of the project and the product that will
              determine what needs to be done.
                       PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE                              Chapter 3   85


 Create work breakdown structure (WBS). Break down the scope into concrete,
 manageable components. In other words, decompose the project deliverables into
 manageable tasks that can be assigned to team members.
 Verify scope. Formalize the acceptance of the completed project deliverables--that
 is, determine how to verify that the project scope has been executed as planned.
 Control scope. Determine how to monitor the status of the project and product
 scope and monitor and control changes to the scope.


        NOTE
 Figure 3.3 presents the big picture of project scope management by showing the
 high-level view of the interaction of various scope management processes. Note that
 only the flow of key data items (inputs and outputs) are shown, which is true for all
 such diagrams throughout the book.




FIGURE 3.3 A high-level view of interactions and data flow between different
              components of scope management.
86    Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        These functions are executed by performing the corresponding processes listed in Table 3.1.
        The Verify Scope and Control Scope processes will be discussed further on in this book,
        whereas other processes of scope management are discussed in this chapter.

         Table 3.1 Processes of Scope Management Mapped to the Process Groups

                                                               requirement documents
         Define Scope             Planning                     Project scope statement
         Create WBS               Planning                     WBS and scope baseline
         Verify Scope             Monitoring and controlling   Acceptance of deliverables and change
                                                               requests
         Control Scope            Monitoring and controlling   Work performance measurements


        So, the project scope planning specifies how to define, verify, and control the project. Before
        you can actually define the scope, though, you need to have a very crucial item in place: stake-
        holder requirements.


     Collecting Requirements for the Project
        The project success is defined as the delivery of the planned outcome with full scope, on time,
        and within the budget. To realize this success, it's very important that there is an agreement on
        what exactly is being delivered with what requirements. A requirement is a condition, charac-
        teristics, or a capability that a specific outcome of the project must have. For example, an
        online banking website is an outcome of the project, and the condition that it must record the
        number of users who have visited the site each day is a requirement. Requirements may come
        from different sources, such as from standards, specifications, and contracts. Stakeholder expec-
        tations and needs often materialize into requirements as well.


                      NOTE
                Generally speaking, project requirements should include the product requirements.
                However, many organizations distinguish between project requirements and product
                requirements, in which case project requirements include strictly project-related
                requirements, such as schedule and delivery requirements, business-related require-
                ments, and other project management requirements, whereas product requirements
                include the product-related requirements, such as requirements related to perfor-
                mance, security, and defects.
                            PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE                             Chapter 3       87


You need to do some requirements planning, which includes:
     Defining and documenting the project requirements
     Defining and documenting the product requirements
     Developing a plan to manage the requirements--the requirements management plan
You do all this in order to determine and fulfill stakeholder expectations and needs.



            TIP
      How effective you are in capturing requirements will determine how effective you will
      be in getting agreement on these requirements from the stakeholders and in manag-
      ing the stakeholder expectations and needs. Also, these requirements go right into
      the foundations of the WBS, along with the deliverables. Therefore, collecting require-
      ments effectively is critical for the success of the project.



You collect requirements by using the Collect Requirements process illustrated in Figure 3.4
in terms of input, tools and techniques, and output. During project initiation, you created the
project charter and the stakeholder register, both discussed in Chapter 2. These two docu-
ments are the input to the Collect Requirements process. Recall that the project charter con-
tains the high-level product description and requirements. You get information about the
stakeholders from the stakeholder register to identify those stakeholders who can provide infor-
mation about requirements.




    FIGURE 3.4 The Collect Requirements process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

With these input items at your disposal, you use some tools and techniques to collect the
requirements.
88     Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


     Tools and Techniques for Collecting Requirements
         You collect the needed information about the requirements by using various techniques, such
         as observations, interviews, questionnaires and surveys, focus groups, facilitated workshops,
         group creativity and decision-making techniques, and prototypes. These tools and techniques
         are discussed in the following paragraphs.
         Observations. Observation is the technique in which the requirements about a product or
         process are gathered by directly observing the user using the product or performing the process.
         In other words, the process or product is observed in action in the real world with people on
         the job. For that reason, this techniques is also called job shadowing. Depending on the situa-
         tion, the observer can simply observe the user doing the job, or he or she can participate in it.
         Interviews, questionnaires, and surveys. An interview is typically performed by asking pre-
         determined and on-the-spot questions and recording the responses. Depending on the situ-
         ation, interviews may take several forms, such as one on one, multiple interviewees, or multiple
         interviewers. For example, by interviewing subject matter experts and individuals who ran sim-
         ilar projects before, you may identify and define some features and functions of the project
         deliverables.
         When you want to cover a large number of respondents quickly, questionnaires and surveys will
         be more appropriate. These are based on written sets of questions.
         Focus groups and facilitated workshops. A focus group is a set of prequalified stakeholders
         and subject matter experts that are brought together with the purpose of learning about their
         opinions, expectations, and attitudes about a product, service, or result that will be the output
         of the project. Generally speaking, a moderator facilitates the interactive discussion to make
         this experience more conversational than one-on-one interviews.
         A facilitated workshop is a session that brings together the cross-functional stakeholders to
         focus on defining product requirements. It generally proves to be an effective technique for
         quickly defining cross-functional requirements and reconciling differences among the stake-
         holders regarding the requirements. These workshops also help in developing trust and improv-
         ing communication among the stakeholders and therefore fostering relationships that will help
         the project to succeed.
         Group creativity techniques. These are group activities organized to identify project (includ-
         ing product) requirements. Here are some examples of such activities:
              Affinity diagram. In this technique, a large number of ideas are classified into dif-
              ferent groups by using some criteria. This facilitates an effective and efficient review
              and analysis.
              Brainstorming. This is a creative technique generally used in a group environment
              to gather ideas as candidates for a solution to a problem or an issue without any
              immediate evaluation of these ideas. The evaluation and analysis of these ideas
                           PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE                            Chapter 3          89


     happens later. Obviously, this technique can also be used to collect requirements.
     Here are examples of two specific kinds of brainstorming:
      Idea/mind mapping. This is an individual brainstorming technique in which a
        multitude of ideas are mapped around a central or key concept in order to expose
        commonalities and differences among ideas and generate new consolidated ideas.
        Mapping also helps in classifying ideas into groups by discovering relationships
        among them. In addition to project management, this technique is also used in
        other areas, such as personal, family, and education. It helps in summarizing,
        clarifying, and revising ideas.
      Nominal group technique. This is the brainstorming technique with voting.
        The voting process is used to rank the ideas generated by brainstorming for fur-
        ther brainstorming or for prioritization.
     Delphi technique. This refers to an information-gathering technique used for
     experts to reach a consensus while sharing their ideas and preferences anonymously.
Group decision-making techniques. Group decision making is, in general, a process used to
collectively assess and evaluate multiple alternatives in terms of expected outcomes. The deci-
sions usually result in taking specific actions. This general technique can also be used to iden-
tify/generate, classify, and prioritize project requirements, including the product requirements.
To reach a group decision, multiple methods are available, including the following:
     Dictatorship. One person has the authority to make the decision. While this expe-
     dites the decision making, it may not be the most effective decision-making method.
     Unanimity. This is opposite of dictatorship: A decision is accepted only if everyone
     agrees.
     Majority. A decision must be supported by more than 50 percent of the members of
     the group.
     Plurality. The alternative supported by largest number of members wins even if this
     number does not make a majority. This situation arises when there are more than
     two alternatives. Plurality with two alternatives is simply a majority method.
Prototypes. A prototype is a working model of a product put together without developing the
actual product. Organizations usually make prototypes for developing proof of concept. Pro-
totypes can also be used to collect requirements by experimenting with the prototype and by
letting stakeholders experiment with it and offer feedback. A prototype is more tangible than
the abstract idea of a product. Prototypes can be improved and modified based on feedback
from the stakeholders. In this way, prototypes support the progressive elaboration process of
developing requirements.
You use one or more of these techniques to generate the output of the Collect Requirements
process.
90     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


     Output of Collecting Requirements
         During this process of collecting the requirements, you will produce two documents: the
         stakeholder requirements document and the requirements management plan.
         Requirements documentation. Also called the stakeholder requirements document, this docu-
         ment consists of a list of requirements and any necessary detail for each item in the list. The
         details of the requirements and the format of the document depend on the project and the
         rules within the performing organization. Following are some essential elements of the
         requirements document:
              Sources of requirements. This describes the overall project outcome to which the
              requirements apply and the purpose of the project, such as the opportunity being
              seized or the business problem being solved.
              Types of requirements. For effective management, you can organize the require-
              ments into different categories using some criteria. For example, all requirements can
              be broadly organized into two categories: functional requirements, referring to the
              functionality of the project outcome, and nonfunctional requirements, such as com-
              pliance, compatibility, and support. Furthermore, these broad categories can be sub-
              divided into more specific types, such as the following:
               Quality requirements, such as not more than three bugs per software module.
               Support and training requirements, such as that the product will be released with
                  a manual.
               Requirements that are based on assumptions and requirements that lead to
                  constraints--for example, phase one of the project must be completed before a
                  specific date.
              Impacts of the requirements. This element describes the impact of requirements on
              the project and on entities external to the project, such as different groups in the
              organization.


                       CAUTION
                 The requirements must be well defined and not vague. As a test, always ask this
                 question: How will I be able to measure or test it? Also, make sure that a requirement
                 is consistent within itself and with other requirements.



         The requirements that you collected will need to be managed.
         Requirements management plan. This plan documents how the requirements will be man-
         aged throughout the project life, which includes how they will be documented and analyzed.
                              PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE                           Chapter 3           91


  The requirements management plan includes the following elements:
       Prioritization. The process and criteria to prioritize the requirements.
       Configuration management. How the changes to the requirements will be
       processed: initiated, analyzed, tracked, and reported.
       Reporting. How, by whom, and to whom the activities related to the requirements
       will be reported.
       Traceability. What the traceability structure of the requirements will be--for exam-
       ple, which attributes of a requirement will be captured on the traceability matrix.
  Requirements are usually tracked by using a tool called a requirements traceability matrix.
  Requirements traceability matrix. As the name suggests, the requirements traceability matrix
  is a table that traces each requirement back to its origin, such as product or business objective,
  and tracks its progress throughout the project life. Linking a requirement to the business objec-
  tive underlines its value. Tracking the requirement throughout the lifecycle of the project
  ensures that it will be delivered before the project is completed. So, this table becomes a very
  useful tool to remind the team how important these requirements are, when they are going to
  be implemented, and how they are progressing in implementing them. The requirements trace-
  ability matrix includes the following links:
       Requirements linked to the origin of the project, such as the opportunity or business
       need
       Requirements linked to the project objectives and deliverables
       Requirements linked to the project scope and the product scope
       Requirements linked to the product design, development, and testing
       High-level requirements linked to their details
       The attributes linked to a requirement
  The key information about a requirement can be stored in the form of its attributes. Here are
  some examples of attributes of a requirement: a unique identifier, description, owner, source,
  priority, status, and completion date.
  With the definition of the project determined during project initiation and the requirements
  collected during planning, and with the project scope management plan in your hands, you are
  all set to begin defining the project scope.



Defining the Project Scope
  The project charter developed during initiation and the stakeholder requirements document,
  also called the requirement documentation, contain enough information about the project and
  the product to start defining the project scope. Now that the project is in the planning stage,
  you have more information than you had in the initiation stage. Therefore, you are in a better
92     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


         position to analyze the needs and expectations related to the project and convert them into
         requirements. Furthermore, the assumptions and constraints can be revisited and analyzed at
         greater length, and additional assumptions and constraints can be identified. This will help to
         define the project scope with more clarity and specificity.


                       NOTE
                 When we say scope or project scope, it generally includes both the scope of the pro-
                 ject and the scope of the product that it will deliver, unless stated otherwise.


         The scope is defined by using the Define Scope process illustrated in Figure 3.5.




             FIGURE 3.5 Define Scope: input, tools and techniques, and output.


     Input to Scope Definition
         The project charter developed during project initiation presents the high-level project and
         product description. It also contains other information relevant to defining the scope, such as
         the project approval requirements. Project and product requirements listed in the requirement
         documentation described earlier in this chapter also contain critical information for defining
         the scope.
         Here are some examples of the organizational process assets that can be helpful in defining the
         scope:
                   Template for the project scope statement
                   Scope-related project files from previous projects
                   Lessons learned from previous projects or from previous phases of this project
                   Policies and procedures relevant to defining the project scope
                              PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE                           Chapter 3         93



               TIP
         It's critical to the success of the project that you determine the scope correctly: only
         the required features and functions for the product and only the required work to pro-
         duce those features and functions; nothing less, nothing more.


   Once you have input for the scope definition, you apply the tools and techniques discussed next
   to define (or redefine) the project scope.


Tools and Techniques for Scope Definition
   This section discusses tools and techniques used in the scope definition process.
        Identification of alternatives. This is a technique used to apply nonstandard
        approaches to perform project work--in this case, to define the project scope. A host
        of general management techniques can be used in this category; the most common
        ones are brainstorming and lateral thinking. Brainstorming, discussed earlier in this
        chapter, is a creative technique generally used in a group environment to gather ideas
        as candidates for a solution to a problem or an issue. The evaluation and analysis of
        these ideas happens later. Lateral thinking is synonymous with thinking outside the
        box. The idea is to think beyond the realm of your experience to search for new
        solutions and methods, not just better uses of the current ones.
        Product analysis. To hammer out the details of the project scope, you might need to
        perform product analysis, which might include techniques such as product break-
        down, requirement analysis, system analysis, system engineering, value analysis, and
        value engineering. The goal is to translate the project objectives into tangible deliver-
        ables and requirements. Each application area has different product analysis methods
        to accomplish this.
        Facilitated workshops. The facilitated workshops described earlier in this chapter
        can also be used in defining the scope.
        Expert judgment. You can use help from relevant experts in the organization to
        develop parts of the detailed project scope.
   You apply one of these tools or techniques to the input to hammer out the output of the scope
   definition process.


Output of Scope Definition
   Depending on the input, the scope definition process can generate two kinds of output: the
   project scope statement that contains the original scope definition and updates to some pro-
   ject documents. Recall that the project scope statement is a component of the baseline used to
   manage the change requests to the project.
94   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


       Changes and Updates
       In the process of defining the project scope, you may end up modifying the existing require-
       ments or adding new requirements. You may also learn more about the stakeholders. Accord-
       ingly, the documents that may be updated as a result of defining the scope include:
            Requirements documentation
            Requirements traceability matrix
            Stakeholder register


       Project Scope Statement
       The key output item of the Define Project process is the project scope statement, which is
       sometimes also called the detailed project scope statement or just the scope statement. The scope
       statement basically states what needs to be accomplished by the project: product and work to
       generate the product. It provides a documented basis for the following:
            Developing a common understanding among the stakeholders about the project
            scope
            Making project decisions throughout the lifecycle of the project
            Measuring performance deviations from the scope
       The specific elements of the project scope statement are discussed in the following list.
            Project assumptions and constraints. Assumptions and constraints are initially
            included in the project charter. However, at this stage, you have more information
            about the project, and therefore you can revisit the initial assumptions and con-
            straints, and you might be able to identify more assumptions and constraints. You
            should document the specific assumptions related to the project scope and also ana-
            lyze their impact in case they turn out to be false. Due to the uncertainty built into
            them, the assumptions are potential sources of risk.
            The constraints related to the project scope must also be documented in the scope
            statement. Because the constraints limit the team's options, the constraints' impact
            on the project must be evaluated. The constraints can come from various sources,
            such as a predetermined deadline (also called a hard deadline) for the completion of
            the project or a milestone, limits on the funds available for the project, and contrac-
            tual provisions. However, the following are common constraints to consider across
            all projects:
             Quality
             Resources
             Scope
             Time (or schedule)
               We will be exploring these items throughout the book.

     Project deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and verifiable product, a capability to
     provide a service, or a result that must be produced to complete a project, a process,
     or a phase of the project. The deliverables can also include project management
     reports and documents. The scope statement provides the list of deliverables and
     their descriptions.
     Project exclusions. This involves drawing boundaries around the project by specify-
     ing what is included and what is not, especially focusing on the gray areas where the
     stakeholders can make their own assumptions, different from each other. It generally
     identifies what is excluded from the project, which helps to manage stakeholder
     expectations.
     Product description. The scope statement must describe the product scope and the
     product acceptance criteria:
      Product scope description. Product scope is defined as features and functions
         that characterize a product, service, or result to be delivered by the project. The
         requirements documentation produced during the Collect Requirements process
         will help define the product scope.
      Product acceptance criteria. This defines the process and criteria for accepting
         the completed products that the project will deliver.



            TIP
     You must be able to make a distinction between objectives, deliverables, and require-
     ments. For example, in a project to launch a website, the website is a deliverable. That
     the website must print a warning message at the login time is a requirement, and that
     the website should increase the company revenue by 3 percent is an objective.



The project scope statement serves the following purposes:
     It serves as a component to the baseline that will be used to evaluate whether the
     request for a change or additional work falls within or beyond the scope of the project.
     By providing a common understanding of the project scope, the scope statement
     helps bring the stakeholders onto the same page in their expectations.
     Because the scope statement describes the deliverables and the work required to
     create those deliverables, it is used to create a WBS, which helps in scheduling the
     project.
     It serves as a guide for the project team to do more detailed planning, if necessary,
     and to perform work during project execution.

        E. The project manager must have a PMP certification.             5. Product acceptance criteria



          In a nutshell, the project scope statement specifies the scope of the project in terms of the prod-
          ucts, services, or results with specified features to be delivered by the project. From the per-
          spective of actually performing the work, the scope statement is still a high-level document. To
          be able to schedule the project, identify and assign resources, and manage the project success-
          fully, these deliverables need to be broken down into manageable tasks. This is accomplished
          by creating an entity called the work breakdown structure (WBS).



     Creating a Work Breakdown
     Structure (WBS)
          What is the secret behind accomplishing seemingly impossible tasks in any area? The answer
          is to break down the required work into smaller, manageable pieces. This is also a very impor-
          tant process in project management. To be able to actually execute the project, the project
          scope is broken down into manageable tasks by creating a work breakdown structure (WBS).
          In other words, a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy of the work that must be performed
          to accomplish the objectives of and create the deliverables for the project.
          Figure 3.6 shows the input, tools and techniques, and output of creating the WBS. The pro-
          ject scope statement contains the list of deliverables and the product description. The require-
          ments documentation describes the product and project requirements. Information in these two
          items provides the basis for creating the WBS. You should always consider organizational
          process assets while going through this and several other processes. In this case, the organiza-
          tional policies and procedure related to creating the WBS, as well as relevant project files and
          lessons learned from previous projects, are some examples of organizational process assets that
          can be helpful.
                                 PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE                             Chapter 3        97




          FIGURE 3.6 The Create WBS process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

   Furthermore, even though each project is unique, there are similarities among sets of projects
   in an organization. These similarities can be used to prepare templates that will be used as a
   starting point for the WBS, to avoid the duplication of work. With or without templates, you
   will need to go through breaking down the deliverables, a very important step in creating the
   WBS.


Decomposition
   Decomposition is a technique for subdividing the project deliverables into smaller, manageable
   tasks called work packages. The WBS is a hierarchical structure with work packages at the low-
   est level of each branch. Based on their complexity, different deliverables can have different lev-
   els of decomposition, as shown in the examples presented in Figure 3.7. In a WBS such as the
   one presented in Figure 3.7, the lines are called branches, and the boxes are called nodes.
   You decompose the project work by executing the following steps:
     1. Identify the deliverables and the work involved by analyzing the project scope state-
        ment and the requirements documentation.
     2. Understand the relationships among the deliverables.
     3. Structure and organize the first level (just below the root of the hierarchical tree) of
        the WBS hierarchy. Based on the project at hand, you can use one of the following
        approaches:
           Use the deliverables as the components in the first level.
           Use the phases of the project as the components in the first level.
           Use the subprojects as components in the first level. A subproject is a part of the
             project that is independent enough of the rest of the project that it can be per-
             formed by another project team. This approach is useful when you want to out-
             source (or procure) parts of the project.
           Use different approaches within each branch of the WBS--for example, a sub-
             project and deliverables in the first level.
98   Part II         PLANNING THE PROJECT




              FIGURE 3.7 An example of a WBS. The work packages are represented by the dark boxes at the end
                            of each branch. Servlet and Bean refer to the programs that will need to be written.

         4. Decompose the upper level into more detailed components for the lower level.
         5. Keep decomposing to lower levels until necessary and sufficient decomposition has
            been achieved.
         6. Assign identification codes to the WBS components.

       As the work is decomposed to lower levels of detail, work components become more concrete
       and manageable. However, you should avoid excessive decomposition, because it will lead to a
       large number of work packages, and it will not be possible to manage all of them effectively.
       In other words, excessive decomposition leads to inefficient use of management and other
       resources. Necessary and sufficient decomposition is the key.


                      TIP
               During decomposition, the components are defined in terms of how the project work
               will actually be executed and controlled. You must verify the correctness of the
               decomposition at each level by requiring that the lower-level components are neces-
               sary and sufficient to the completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables.

   One final point. While using the technique of decomposition, remember a useful concept or
   trick: rolling wave planning. It's a fancy term that refers to handling a deliverable or subproject
   that currently cannot be decomposed fully because you don't know the details about it yet--
   for example, it is to be executed far into the future. You leave the decomposition of such a deliv-
   erable at a level allowed by the available information and wait for further decomposition until
   more information becomes available. Yes, it is an example of progressive elaboration.
   The WBS document is the key item of the Create WBS process, but there are some other out-
   put items as well.


Output of Creating WBS
   The output of the Create WBS process consists of the items discussed in the following list.
        Work breakdown structure. As explained earlier, the WBS is a deliverable-oriented
        hierarchical structure that decomposes the deliverables into the work that will be
        executed by the project team to create the planned deliverables and to accomplish
        the planned project objectives. The project manager creates this document with the
        help of the project team. Following are some important characteristics of the WBS:
         Control account. Remember that each node represents a deliverable or a com-
            ponent of it at certain level, and each deliverable will have scope, schedule, and
            cost attached to it. Some suitable nodes in the WBS are selected as management
            control points. At each of these control points, scope, schedule, and cost are inte-
            grated for the purposes of monitoring and controlling the performance. For
            example, the integrated scope, schedule, and actual cost at these points can be
            compared to the earned value to measure the project performance. (You will
            learn about earned value in an upcoming chapter.) Such management points are
            called control accounts. Each control account may have one or more work pack-
            ages under it. Obviously, each work package must belong to only one account;
            otherwise, some factors, such as cost, will be double counted or counted multiple
            times. A WBS component that is below the control account, that has a well-
            defined work content but does not yet have a detailed schedule, is called a plan-
            ning package.
         Code of account. Each component in the WBS hierarchy, including work pack-
            ages, is assigned a unique identifier called a code of account identifier. These iden-
            tifiers can then be used in estimating costs, scheduling, and assigning resources.
         Scope. The WBS embraces the full scope of the project. If a task is not included
            in the WBS, it will not be done as a part of the project.
         Step toward team building. Because the project manager creates the WBS with
            the help of the project team, it is also the beginning of the team-building process
            on the part of the project manager.
100   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


              Step toward scheduling. The WBS decomposes the project work into manage-
                 able pieces (work packages) that can be assigned to individuals. This helps define
                 the responsibilities for the team members and is the starting point for building
                 the schedule.
              Reference for communication. Throughout the project, the WBS works as a
                 reference for communication regarding what is included in the project and what
                 is not.
             WBS dictionary. This is a supporting document for the main WBS document to
             provide details about the components of the WBS. The details about a component
             might include elements such as a code of account identifier, description of work
             involved, quality requirements, acceptance criteria, a list of milestones schedule, cost
             estimates, required resources, contract information (if any), and the organization or
             group responsible for this component.
             Updates. During the create WBS process, the project team might realize that some-
             thing out of the existing scope must be included in order to accomplish something
             in the scope. This will give rise to a change request, which might also come from
             other stakeholders during or after the first creation of the WBS. After the change
             request has been approved, not only the WBS will be changed--the scope statement
             must also be updated accordingly. The impact of the approved change request on the
             project scope management plan must be evaluated, and the plan must be updated
             accordingly.
             Scope baseline. This is not a different item in and of itself. The scope statement, the
             WBS document, and the WBS dictionary combined constitute the scope baseline
             against which all the change requests will be evaluated.


                      NOTE
                Do not confuse the WBS with other information breakdown structures, such as the
                organizational breakdown structure (OBS), which provides a hierarchy of the perform-
                ing organization and can be used to identify organizational units for assigning the
                WBS work packages. Remember, the end goal of the WBS is to specify the project
                scope in terms of work packages; this is what distinguishes the WBS from other infor-
                mation breakdown structures.



        You might wonder who creates the WBS. Well, it is your responsibility, and you, the project
        manager, create it with the help of the team. Which team? The work packages do not exist
        before the WBS is complete; therefore, no assignments have been made yet. Catch 22? Yes,
        you are right--depending upon the project, the final formal project team might not even exist
        yet. However, practically speaking, there will already be some people working with you on the
        project by now. Some of them are the potential team members. In addition to them, you can
        use the help of relevant experts in the organization and some stakeholders. Also, by now you

    have a very good idea of who will probably be working to generate the outcome of the project.
    It's a good idea to involve those individuals in creating the WBS. This will give them a sense
    of participation and ownership. After all, the WBS will be the reference for the work through-
    out the project.


                 CAUTION
          The PMP exam expects you to know the ropes of the formal standard terminology.
          For example, if I say project plan, you should be able to figure out that I'm referring to
          the project management plan. Another example: If I say defining scope, you should
          be able to translate it to the Define Scope process, the same way you will translate
          the planning stage to the planning process group.

Before and After the WBS
    From the initiating process group until now, I have discussed quite a few documents created in
    various processes. Some of these documents become input into another process that creates
    some other document. It is important to understand the order in which these documents are
    created and which document is an input to creating which other document. This is shown in
    Figure 3.8.
    The WBS is at the heart of project management. It affects directly or indirectly almost all the
    processes that are performed after its creation. Figure 3.9 shows some of the processes that are
    directly based on the WBS as a component of scope baseline.
    The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
         You need to collect requirements by using the Collect Requirements process before
         you can define the project scope.
         The requirements documentation generated by the Collect Requirements process
         and the project charter generated during the project initiation are used to define the
         scope, which is documented in the project scope statement.
         The requirements documentation and the project scope statement are input items to
         create the work breakdown structure (WBS), which is a breakdown of project deliver-
         ables into manageable pieces called work packages. The WBS is supported by another
         document called the WBS dictionary, which offers details for the WBS components.

Summary
  After a project has been initiated, the project management plan is developed to specify how
  the project at hand will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project man-
  agement plan can contain subsidiary plans, such as a quality management plan, a risk man-
  agement plan, a project scope management plan, and a scope baseline. The scope baseline
  consists of the project scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and WBS dictio-
  nary. Collecting requirements is part of the scope planning, which creates requirements docu-
  mentation. The project charter and requirements documentation are used to define the scope,
  which creates the project scope statement.
  The project scope statement is a document that defines the scope of a project, including the
  product scope, by stating what needs to be accomplished by the project. It includes project
  deliverables, product description, product acceptance criteria, assumptions and constraints,
  and project exclusions. The project scope statement and requirements documentation are
  input items to creating the work breakdown structure (WBS), which is a breakdown of pro-
  ject deliverables into manageable pieces called work packages, which in turn are used to develop
  the project schedule. The WBS is supported by another document called the WBS dictionary,
  which offers details for the WBS components.
  The scope statement, the WBS document, and the WBS dictionary combined constitute the
  scope baseline against which all change requests are evaluated. The WBS is the heart of pro-
  ject management, as it is used in managing many aspects of the project, including developing
  the schedule. The schedule and communication planning are the topics of the next chapter.

         Look Out

          Do not confuse project scope with product scope. The product scope consists of the features
                and functions that characterize a product, service, or result to be delivered by the project,
                whereas the project scope is composed of the work that must be performed (and only that
                work) to deliver products, services, or results with specified features.

          There is no formal standard process to develop the project scope management plan; it's created
                as a part of the effort to develop the project management plan.

         Memorize

          The project scope statement includes these elements: project assumptions and constraints, pro-
                ject deliverables, project exclusions, product scope description, and product acceptance criteria.

          Quality, resources, scope, predefined budgets, and imposed dates or deadlines are some com-
                mon constraints you should consider across all projects.

          The scope baseline consists of the WBS, WBS dictionary, and project scope statement.
          All subsidiary plans are integrated into one plan called the project management plan.

                             a schedule baseline against which the project
                             progress will be measured.
Introduction
  At its core, a project consists of two main components: the project work that needs to be per-
  formed and the schedule to perform that work. The overall project work is broken down into
  smaller, manageable components. These components in the WBS are called work packages.
  However, a work package might not be suitable to assign to an individual to perform. So, work
  packages can be rearranged, such as decomposed into smaller components called activities. A
  project schedule contains not only the activities to be performed, but also the order (sequence)
  in which the activities will be performed and a start and a finish date. The sequencing of activ-
  ities is constrained by the dependencies among the activities.
  A realistic project schedule can be created from the bottom up by identifying the activities, esti-
  mating the resources for the activities, and determining the time that each activity will take
  with the given resources available. The resources required to complete the activities include
  human resources. Before, during, and after schedule development, you will need to communi-
  cate effectively.
  To enable you to wrap your mind around this issue, I will explore the following three avenues:
  generating the data about project activities, such as determining activities and their character-
  istics, including resource requirements and activity durations; building a project schedule from
  the data on the activities; and planning communication.



The Long and Winding Road to the
Project Schedule
  Planning the project schedule is all about time management. To complete a project, you need
  to perform some activities to produce the project deliverables. To make that happen, you need
  to assign resources to the activities and schedule them. But before all this can happen, you
  need to identify the activities. Although all this sounds like common sense, it makes sense to
  define the following terms so we are all on the same page.
       Activity. A component of project work.
       Activity duration. The time measured in calendar units between the start and finish
       of a schedule activity.
       Schedule activity. A scheduled task (component of work) performed during the life-
       cycle of a project.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                         Chapter 4   111


       Logical relationship. A dependency between two project schedule activities or
       between a schedule activity and a schedule milestone.
       Schedule milestone. A milestone is a significant point (or event) in the life of a
       project, and a schedule milestone is a milestone on the project schedule. A milestone
       refers to the completion of an activity, marking possibly the completion of a set of
       activities, and therefore has zero duration. The completion of a major deliverable is
       an example of a milestone.
  Project time management includes the processes required to complete the project in a timely
  manner. Figure 4.1 presents the flow diagram for the time management processes that lead to
  schedule development.




      FIGURE 4.1 The time management processes that lead to schedule development.
112   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        The usages of these processes are listed here:
             Define Activities. Identifies the specific schedule activities that must be performed
             to produce the project deliverables.
             Sequence Activities. Identifies the dependencies among the schedule activities and
             orders the activities accordingly.
             Estimate Activity Resources. Estimates the types and amounts of resources that
             will be required to perform each schedule activity. Examples of resources are materi-
             als, equipment, supplies, and people.
             Estimate Activity Duration. Estimates the time in work periods individually for
             each schedule activity required for the activity's completion. A work period is a mea-
             surement of time when the work is in progress; it is measured in hours, days, or
             months, depending upon the size of the activity. This estimate is performed for
             given resources.
             Develop Schedule. Develops the project schedule by analyzing schedule activity
             sequences, schedule activity durations, resource requirements, and schedule con-
             straints.
             Control Schedule. Monitors the status of the project progress and controls the
             changes to the schedule baseline.


                      NOTE
                The underlying philosophy of project management for schedule development is to first
                develop the schedule based on the work required to complete the project tasks and
                then see how you can make it conform to other constraints, calendar requirements,
                and strategic goals of the organization. You, the project manager, build the schedule
                through cold, hard mathematical analysis, and you don't just accept whatever sched-
                ule goals come down the pipeline from elsewhere, such as from the customer or the
                project sponsor.



        All these processes, except the Control Schedule process, belong to planning and therefore are
        discussed in this chapter, whereas the Control Schedule process is explored in an upcoming
        chapter.
        In a nutshell, the path to schedule development includes defining activities, arranging the activ-
        ities in the correct order, and estimating the resources required to complete the activities. In
        other words, the work necessary for completing the project is expressed in terms of activities,
        and the resources are required to complete those activities. So, the first step toward schedule
        planning after creating the WBS is defining activities.

Defining Activities
    Activities that need to be performed to produce the project deliverables are identified using
    the activity definition process shown in Figure 4.2. The starting point for defining the activi-
    ties is the lowest level of the WBS that contains work packages. Each work package can be
    broken down into one or more activities. So, the key input items to the activity definition
    process are the WBS and the WBS dictionary.




        FIGURE 4.2 The Define Activities process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


Input to Defining Activities
    Identifying project activities starts with the work packages in the WBS, which in turn are
    derived from the project scope statement. These two obvious input items, along with others,
    are discussed here.
    Project scope baseline. Elements of the scope baseline, such as deliverables, assumptions, and
    constraints, will be useful in defining activities. All the following three components of the pro-
    ject scope statement are needed to define activities:
         WBS and WBS dictionary. The work packages in the WBS are decomposed into
         project activities. To define activities in detail so that you can assign appropriate
         resources to them, you need the details about work packages, which are provided in
         the WBS dictionary.
         Project scope statement. The WBS is built from the project scope statement. While
         dealing with the WBS, you might need to go back to the project scope statement.
         The following elements of the project scope statement are especially important to
         consider while identifying activities:
          Assumptions related to the activities or schedule planning, such as work hours
             per week
          Constraints that will limit the schedule options, such as predetermined deadlines
             on project milestones
          Project deliverables, to ensure that everything is covered in WBS work packages
114   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Enterprise environmental factors. The enterprise environmental factors relevant to
             identifying schedule activities include project management information systems and
             project scheduling software tools.
             Organizational process assets. Following are examples of organizational process
             assets that can be useful in the process of identifying activities:
              Organizational policies related to activity planning
              Organizational procedures and guidelines used in defining activities
              Knowledge base of lessons learned from previous projects regarding activity lists
        So, the major input to the activity definition process is the WBS, whose work packages are
        decomposed into activities using some tools and techniques discussed in the following section.


   Tools and Techniques for Defining Activities
        The major task in the Define Activities process is to decompose the work packages in the WBS
        into activities. This decomposition, along with other tools and techniques, is discussed here.
        Decomposition. Recall that you used the decomposition technique to create the WBS by
        subdividing the project deliverables into smaller manageable tasks called work packages. Decom-
        position is also used in the activity definition process for subdividing the work packages into
        smaller, more manageable components called schedule activities.



                      TIP
                You create the WBS and decompose the work packages to project activities with the
                help of the project team. Even though the schedule is not yet developed and the
                resources are not fully assigned, the project team in some initial form will be there.
                When decomposing a work package into activities, involve the individuals who either
                are familiar with the work packages or will be responsible for them.



        Component planning. If there are areas of the project scope for which sufficient information
        is not available yet, there will definitely be corresponding components in the WBS that are
        not decomposed to the level of work packages. You can only develop a high-level schedule for
        these planning components. You accommodate this kind of high-level scheduling by using a
        technique called rolling wave planning to plan the project work at various levels of detail
        depending upon the availability of information. Work to be performed in the near future is
        planned to the low level of the WBS, whereas work to be performed far into the future can
        be planned at the relatively high level of the WBS. So, a WBS component at the bottom level
        of a branch of WBS hierarchy for which some planning can be performed is called a planning
        component.
 PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                           Chapter 4       115



                 NOTE
          Rolling wave planning is an example of progressive elaboration, which was discussed
          in Chapter 1.


    Templates. As a timesaver and a guide, you can use a standard activity list or an activity list
    from a previous project similar to the project at hand as a template. The template can also con-
    tain information about the activities in it, such as required hours of effort.
    Expert judgment. Activities make the core of a project. So, it's very important to identify and
    define them correctly to make the project schedule efficient and effective. Therefore, expert
    judgment is a very important tool that can be used in this process. For example, during the
    process of decomposing the work packages into schedule activities, you can use the help of team
    members and other experts who are experienced in developing WBS and project schedules.
    Using these techniques, you convert the work packages in the WBS into schedule activities,
    which, along with some other items, make the output of the activity definition process.


Output of Defining Activities
    The key output item of the activity definition process is a comprehensive list of all the sched-
    ule activities that need to be performed to produce the project deliverables. This and other
    output items are discussed in the following list.
    Activity list. This is a list of all the activities that are necessary and sufficient to produce the
    project deliverables. In other words, these activities are derived from the WBS and hence are
    within the scope of the project. Also, the scope of each schedule activity should be described
    to sufficient detail in concrete terms, so that the team member responsible for it will under-
    stand what work needs to be performed. Examples of schedule activities include a book chap-
    ter with a summary of content, a computer program that will accomplish a well-defined task,
    and an application to be installed on a computer.
    Activity attributes. These attributes are in addition to the scope description of the activity in
    the activity list. The list of attributes of an activity can include the following:
            Activity identifier and code
            Activity description
            Assumptions and constraints related to this activity, such as imposed date
            Predecessor and successor activities
            Resource requirements
            Team member responsible for performing the work and information about the
            work--for example, where it will be performed
116   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Some attributes evolve over time. The attributes are used to arrange the activities in the cor-
        rect order (sequencing) and to schedule them.
        Milestone list. A schedule milestone is a significant event in the project schedule, such as the
        completion of a major deliverable. A milestone can be mandatory, such as one required by a
        contract, or optional, such as one determined by the team to run the project more smoothly.
        The milestone list includes all the milestones and specifies whether a milestone is mandatory
        or optional. Milestones are used in building the schedule.


                      CAUTION
                The Define Activities process generates the final output as activities and not deliver-
                ables. Therefore, ideally speaking, the WBS and the WBS dictionary should be gener-
                ated before defining activities. However, practically speaking, the activity list, the
                WBS, and the WBS dictionary can be developed concurrently.



        To summarize, the output items of the activity definition process are a schedule activity list, a
        list of attributes for each activity, and a list of milestones. Before you can schedule them, the
        identified activities need to be arranged in the correct order, which is called sequencing.



   Sequencing Activities
        The activity sequencing process is used to arrange the schedule activities in the appropriate
        order, which takes into account the dependencies among the activities. For example, if Activ-
        ity B depends upon the product of Activity A, then Activity A must be performed before Activ-
        ity B. So the activity sequencing has a two-pronged goal--to identify the dependencies among
        the schedule activities and to order the activities accordingly. Figure 4.3 shows the activity
        sequencing process.




            FIGURE 4.3 The Sequence Activities process: input, tools and techniques, and output.
 PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                          Chapter 4       117


   Comparing Figure 4.3 with Figure 4.2 reveals that all the output items of the activity defini-
   tion process are the input into the activity sequencing process. The project scope statement is
   an additional input item, and it can be used as a source to check the accuracy of the activity
   list and to ensure that the activity list covers the scope of the project and the products.
   You use the appropriate tools and techniques to determine the dependencies among the sched-
   ule activities and sequence them accordingly.


Tools and Techniques for Sequencing Activities
   Dependency determination is the prerequisite to determine sequencing. Therefore, most of
   the tools and techniques used for sequencing are focused on determining and displaying the
   dependencies.
   Determining dependencies. To properly sequence the schedule activities, you need to deter-
   mine the dependencies among them. As illustrated in Figure 4.4, a dependency relationship
   between two activities is defined by two terms: predecessor and successor. In other words, when
   two activities are in a dependency relationship with each other, one of them is a predecessor of
   the other, and the other one is the successor. In Figure 4.4, Activity A is a predecessor of
   Activity B, and Activity B is successor of Activity A. That means A must start before B.




       FIGURE 4.4 Predecessor/successor relationship between two activities.

   By definition, the successor activity must start after the predecessor activity has already started.
   But exactly when can the successor activity start after the predecessor activity has already been
   started? Well, both the predecessor and the successor have a start and a finish, and there are at
   maximum four possible combinations between the start and finish points of the predecessor
   and the successor activities. Accordingly, there are four kinds of dependencies, also called
   precedence relationships or logical relationships, listed here:
        Finish to start. The initiation of the successor activity depends upon the completion
        of the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be started until the
        predecessor activity has already been completed.
        Finish to finish. The completion of the successor activity depends upon the comple-
        tion of the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be completed
        until the predecessor activity has already been completed.
118   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Start to start. The initiation of the successor activity depends upon the initiation of
             the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be initiated until the
             predecessor activity has already been initiated.
             Start to finish. The completion of the successor activity depends upon the initiation
             of the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be completed until
             the predecessor activity has already been initiated.
        These types of dependencies describe the logical relationships between activities. Where do
        these relationships come from? To answer this question, the dependencies can be grouped into
        three categories:
             Mandatory dependencies. These are the dependencies inherent to the schedule
             activities. For example, a software program must be developed before it can be
             tested. Mandatory dependencies are also referred to as hard logic.
             Discretionary dependencies. These are the dependencies at the discretion of the
             project team. For example, perhaps it was possible to perform Activities A and B
             simultaneously or to perform A after B was finished, but the team decided, for
             whatever reason, to perform B after A was finished. Some of the guidelines for
             establishing discretionary dependencies can come from the knowledge of best prac-
             tices within the given application area and from the previous experience of perform-
             ing a similar project. Discretionary dependencies are also referred to as soft logic,
             preferential logic, or preferred logic.
             External dependencies. An external dependency involves a relationship between a
             project activity and a non-project activity--that is, an activity outside the project.
             For example, in a movie production project, think of a project activity that involves
             shooting scenes with lots of tourists skiing. This scene is planned to be shot at a ski-
             ing resort during the skiing season. This is an example of an external dependency.
        The dependency between two schedule activities is an example of the logical relationships
        defined earlier in this chapter. Logical relationships can be displayed in schematic diagrams,
        called project schedule network diagrams, or just network diagrams for brevity. A common method
        to develop network diagrams is called the precedence diagramming method (PDM).
        Precedence diagramming method (PDM). The precedence diagramming method is the
        method to construct a project schedule network diagram in which a box (for example, a rec-
        tangle) is used to represent an activity and an arrow is used to represent dependency between
        two activities. The boxes representing activities are called nodes. Figure 4.5 presents an exam-
        ple of a network diagram constructed by using PDM, in which Activity A is a predecessor of
        Activity B, Activity C is a predecessor of Activities D and G, and so on.

        FIGURE 4.5 An example of a project schedule network diagram constructed by using the prece-
                      dence diagramming method (PDM).

    In this diagram, only C and I have more than one successor. In general, PDM supports all four
    kinds of precedence relationships discussed earlier, but the most commonly used dependency
    relationship in PDM is finish to start. The start-to-finish relationship is rarely used.
    Applying leads and lags. In the real world, some activities may need or lend themselves to what
    are called leads and lags to accurately or effectively define the logical relationships. For exam-
    ple, the finish-to-start dependency means that the successor activity starts where the prede-
    cessor activity finishes. Applying a lead means you allow the successor activity to start before
    the predecessor activity finishes, and applying a lag means you start the successor activity a few
    days after the predecessor activity finishes. Sometimes you might need to make such adjust-
    ments in the schedule for effectiveness and efficiency.
    Schedule network templates. You can use standardized network diagram templates to expe-
    dite the process of activity sequencing. You can also use network diagrams from previous pro-
    jects and modify them for the project at hand.

    You use these methods to construct project schedule network diagrams, which are the major
    output of the activity sequencing process.
120   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


   Output of Sequencing Activities
        The goal of the activity sequencing process is to determine the dependencies among the
        schedule activities and sequence the activities accordingly. The sequencing is presented in net-
        work diagrams. Following are the output items from the activity sequencing process:
             Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams, discussed in the previous sec-
             tion, can be created manually or by using an appropriate project management soft-
             ware application. Depending upon a project's size, you might have multiple network
             diagrams for it.
             Updates to project documents. During the process of sequencing activities, you may
             identify new necessary activities, split an activity into two, modify activity attributes,
             add new attributes, or identify a risk related to an activity. Accordingly, you may
             need to modify some project documents, such as the activity list, activity attributes,
             and the risk register.
        You can make the activity list, and you can sequence the activities. These are important steps
        that must be executed. However, to perform the activities, you need resources.



   Estimating Activity Resource
   Requirements
        The resource requirements for an activity are estimated by using the Estimate Activity
        Resources process. The main purpose of this process is to accomplish the following goals:
             Estimate the types of resources needed for a given activity
             Estimate the quantities of each type of resource needed for the activity
        Figure 4.6 shows the Estimate Activity Resources process with its input, tools and techniques,
        and output.

 PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                       Chapter 4       121


   The activity list and attributes determined by the Define Activities process are the major input
   items to activity resource estimating.


Input to Activity Resource Estimating
   The activity list and attributes are the obvious and major input to the activity resource esti-
   mating process. These and other input items are discussed in the following list.
        Activity list and activity attributes. The activity list originally developed during the
        activity definition process identifies the schedule activities that need the resources.
        The activity attributes provide the details for the activities, which will be helpful in
        estimating the resources.
        Resource calendars. Resource estimating will require information on the available
        quantity of resources of different types, such as human, equipment, and material.
        This information is usually available in the resource calendars, which may also have
        detailed information about human resources, such as skill level, experience, and the
        geographical location from where the resource will come. Typically, the resource cal-
        endar contains the following useful information about the resources:
         Days and times of day when a resource is available
         The passive time for the resource--for example, holidays for human resources
         The quantity of each type of available resource
         The capability of each resource
        Enterprise environmental factors. Information about the infrastructure of the per-
        forming organization, such as existing facilities, will be used in identifying the
        resources and their availability.
        Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets useful for activity
        resource estimating include organizational policies for staffing and purchase of sup-
        plies, historical information on what types of resources were used for similar activi-
        ties in a previous project, and the like.
   Once you understand the activities, you can use some tools and techniques to determine the
   resources required to perform those activities.


Tools and Techniques for Activity Resource Estimating
   Following are the tools and techniques used to determine the resources required to perform
   schedule activities.
        Alternative analysis. Alternative analysis is all about exploring alternative solutions
        to a problem. In the case of estimating resource requirements, you will need to con-
        sider alternatives available for resources needed for some schedule activities. For
        example, you might need to decide whether you want to buy or develop a tool needed
        to perform an activity, what types of machines (for example, Windows or Linux) to
        use, which computers to use to do the development, or what level of skills is needed.
122   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Bottom-up estimating. You might discover that it is rather complex to estimate
             resources for a given schedule activity. If the problem is inherent to the activity, it
             might be helpful in certain cases to decompose the activity into smaller components
             for the purpose of resource estimating and, then estimate the resource for each com-
             ponent, and then aggregate the resources to get an estimate for the whole activity. In
             aggregation, you must consider the possible relationships (overlaps and such) among
             different components of the activity so you don't double-count the resources.
             Expert judgment. Expert judgment can be used to assess the input and determine
             the output of the resource estimating process.
             Published estimating data. Information published by various vendors, such as costs
             for resources, can be useful in estimating the resources.
             Project management software. Depending upon the sophistication of the resource
             requirements and the capabilities of the available features, project management soft-
             ware might be useful in estimating and managing the resources. It can also be used
             to create resource breakdown structures.
        You can use a combination of these tools and techniques to generate the output of the resource
        estimating process.


   Output of Activity Resource Estimating
        The resource requirements are the major output of the resource estimating process. These and
        other output items are discussed in the following list.
        Activity resource requirements. The main purpose of the activity resource estimating process
        is to determine the resource requirements for each activity, and therefore this is the major out-
        put item from this process. You identify the types of resources required to perform each activ-
        ity and estimate the required quantity of each identified resource. If a work package in the WBS
        has multiple activities, the resource estimates for those activities can be aggregated to estimate
        the resource requirements for the work package. The requirement documents may also include
        information such as the basis for each estimate, the assumptions made for the estimate, and
        the availability of the resources.
        Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical
        structure of resource categories and types required to complete the schedule activities of a pro-
        ject. The RBS can be used to identify and analyze the project human resource assignments.
        Updates to project documents. The identified types of required resources for an activity and
        the estimated quantity for each identified resource become activity attributes and must be added
        to the attribute list for the activity. Activity resource estimating might generate modifications
        to the activity list--for example, to add or delete an activity. It may also cause you to change
        the resource calendar.
        Once the activities have been identified and resources required to perform each activity have
        been estimated, you have enough information to begin estimating the time needed to com-
        plete each activity, which is called the activity duration.

Estimating Activity Duration
    Activity duration is the time between the start and finish of a schedule activity. Activity dura-
    tion is estimated in work periods by using the Estimate Activity Durations process. A work
    period is a measurement of time when the work is in progress; it is measured in hours, days, or
    months, depending upon the size of the activity. This estimate can be converted to calendar
    units of time by factoring in the resource's passive time, such as holidays. For an example, sup-
    pose you have estimated that it will take one programmer four days (with eight work hours in
    a day) to write a program. You also know that the work will start on a Friday and there will be
    no work on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the activity duration estimate is four days (or 32
    hours) measured in work periods and six days measured in calendar units.
    Figure 4.7 shows the input, tools and techniques, and output for activity duration estimating.




        FIGURE 4.7 The Estimate Activity Durations process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


Input to Activity Duration Estimating
    To estimate the activity duration, you will need information about the activity, the resource
    requirements for the activity, and the resources available for the activity. This underlines the
    major input items to the activity duration estimating process. These and other input items are
    discussed here.
    Activity list and activity attributes. Because you want to estimate the duration of the activi-
    ties, the activity list along with the activity attributes, originally developed in the Define
    Activities process, are the obvious input items to the activity duration estimating process.
    Activity resource requirements. The work periods required to complete an activity depend on
    the resources assigned to the activity. For example, suppose it will take four work days to com-
    plete an activity that involves having two programmers write two programs. If only one pro-
    grammer is available, it will take roughly eight work days to finish this activity. However, while
    assigning additional resources to an activity, always consider the following:
         Sometimes assigning additional resources might reduce the overall efficiency and
         productivity. For example, think of two engineers with different skill levels assigned
         to work on the interrelated components of an activity.
124   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Most of the activities have a threshold beyond which assigning additional resources
             does not help. For example, installing an operating system on a machine will take
             the same amount of time regardless of how many system administrators have been
             assigned to this activity.
        Resource calendar. The resource calendar, finalized (or modified) during activity resource
        estimating, contains the type, quantity, availability, and capability of each resource, including
        the skills of a human resource, which must be considered during activity duration estimating.
        For example, an experienced programmer can finish the same program in less time than a
        beginner can. Capability and quantity of available resources, both human and material, can
        affect the activity duration estimate. For example, if an activity will take four work days for an
        engineer to finish, and the engineer can work only four hours a day on this activity, it will take
        eight calendar days to finish.
        Project scope statement. Some assumptions and constraints in the project scope statement
        can affect activity duration estimates and therefore must be considered. For example, there
        might be an assumption that part of the work related to an activity has already been performed
        in a previous project and can be used in this project. If the assumption is true, the activity
        duration will be less than otherwise. An example of a constraint might be that a specific work
        package must be finished before a predetermined deadline. This will put a maximum limit on
        the duration for the activities corresponding to this work package.
        Enterprise environmental factors. Examples of enterprise environmental factors are some
        databases that contain reference data relevant to the activity duration--for instance, how long
        it takes for a specific government agency to respond to a request. Published commercial infor-
        mation and metrics to measure productivity can also be helpful in duration estimates.
        Organizational process assets. Organizational process assets that will be useful in estimating
        activity duration include information from previous projects and a calendar of working days
        and non-working days.
        In a nutshell, the activity list and activity resource requirements are the major inputs to the
        activity duration process. The activity duration estimate is a nontrivial task, and there are var-
        ious tools and techniques available to perform this task effectively and reliably.


   Tools and Techniques for Activity Duration Estimating
        The project schedule depends upon the activity duration estimates. The duration estimates of
        activities on the critical path will determine the finish date of a project for a given start date.
        However, there might be many uncertainties involved in the estimate. For example, two pro-
        grammers, due to the differences in their experience, will take different amounts of time to
        write the same program. The good news is that there are a number of tools and techniques
        that you can use in activity duration estimating.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                          Chapter 4       125


  Analogous estimating. Analogous estimating techniques estimate the duration of an activity
  based on the duration of a similar activity in a previous project. The accuracy of the estimate
  depends upon how similar the activities are and whether the team member who will perform
  the activity has the same level of expertise and experience as the team member from the pre-
  vious project. This technique is useful when there is not enough detail information about the
  project or a project activity available--for example, in the early stages of a project.
  Parametric estimating. This is a quantitative technique used to calculate the activity duration
  when the productivity rate of the resource performing the activity is available. You use a for-
  mula such as the following one to calculate the duration:
          Activity duration = Units of work in the activity / Productivity rate of the resources
  For example, if you know that a team assigned to the activity of burying 40 miles of cable can
  bury two miles of cable in one day, the duration calculation can be performed as follows:
          Activity duration = 40 miles / (2 miles/day) = 20 days
  Three-point estimating. This method addresses the issue of uncertainty in estimating the
  activity duration. The uncertainty in the duration estimate can be calculated by making a three-
  point estimate in which each point corresponds to one of the following estimate types:
       Most likely scenario. The activity duration is calculated in most practical terms by
       factoring in resources likely to be assigned, realistic expectations of the resources,
       dependencies, and interruptions.
       Optimistic scenario. This is the best-case version of the situation described in the
       most likely scenario.
       Pessimistic scenario. This is the worst-case version of the situation described in the
       most likely scenario.
  The spread of these three estimates determines the uncertainty. The resultant duration is cal-
  culated by taking the average of the three estimates. For example, if the duration for an activ-
  ity is estimated to be 20 days for the most likely scenario, 18 days for the optimistic scenario,
  and 22 days for the pessimistic scenario, then the average duration is 20 days, and the uncer-
  tainty is  2 days, which can be expressed as:
          Duration = 20  2 days
  It's equivalent to saying that the activity duration is 20 days, give or take two days.
  However, the most likely scenario may be given more weight than the other two scenarios.
  Therefore, the expected duration can be calculated by using the following formula:
          te = (ntm+to+tp)/(n+2)
  where te is the expected duration, tm is the duration in the most likely scenario, to is the dura-
  tion in the optimistic scenario, tp is the duration in the pessimistic scenario, and n is the weight
  given to the most likely scenario.
126     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


      STUDY CHECKPOINT 4.2
      In the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), the most likely scenario is given a
      weight of 4 as compared to the weight of 1 for each of the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.
      The pessimistic estimate for an activity is 25 days, the optimistic estimate is 5 days, and the
      most likely estimate is 10 days. Calculate the expected estimate by using the PERT technique.



           Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to incorporate a time cushion into your schedule;
           this cushion is called a contingency reserve, a time reserve, or a time buffer. The whole idea is to
           accommodate the possibility of schedule risks. One method of calculating the contingency
           reserve is to take a percentage of the original activity duration estimate as the contingency
           reserve. It can also be estimated by using quantitative analysis methods. Later, when more infor-
           mation about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve can be reduced or elimi-
           nated.
           Expert judgment. Expert judgment can be used to estimate the whole duration of an activity
           when not enough information is available. It can also be used to estimate some parameters to
           be used in other methods--for example, what percentage of the original activity duration esti-
           mate should be used as a contingency reserve--and in comparing an activity to a similar activ-
           ity in a previous project during analogous estimating.
           Note that, in general, a combination of techniques is used to estimate the duration of an activ-
           ity. For example, you can use the analogous technique and expert judgment to estimate the
           productivity rate of resources and then use that productivity rate in parametric analysis to cal-
           culate the activity duration.


   Output of Activity Duration Estimating
           Guess what the output of the activity duration estimating process is. Yes, you are right: It is
           the activity duration estimates! Regardless of which technique you use, these estimates are
           quantitative assessments of the required time units to finish activities, such as five days or 10
           weeks. As shown earlier, you can also assign an uncertainty to the estimate, such as 202 days
           to say that the activity will take at least 18 days and at most 22 days.
           The duration of an activity is an attribute of the activity. Therefore, you update the
           activity attributes, originally developed in the Define Activities process, to include the activity
           durations.
           In a nutshell, there are two output items of the activity duration estimating process:
                Activity duration estimates
                Updates to activity attributes and assumptions about skill level and availability of
                resources

   By using various processes discussed in this chapter, you have identified schedule activities,
   arranged them in proper sequence, determined resource requirements for them, and estimated
   their durations. All these tasks and accomplishments are a means to an end called project sched-
   ule development.



Developing the Project Schedule
   The project work is composed of individual activities. So, the processes previously discussed in
   this chapter deal with the activities: defining activities, estimating activity durations, and esti-
   mating resource requirements of the activities. By using these processes, you work out a few
   schedule-related pieces at the activity level, which come together as the project schedule when
   you crank them through the schedule development process, formally called Develop Schedule.
   Until you have a realistic project schedule, you do not have a project. A project schedule has
   schedule activities sandwiched between the project start date and the project finish date. Fig-
   ure 4.8 shows the Develop Schedule process used to develop the project schedule.




       FIGURE 4.8 The Develop Schedule process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

   All the processes discussed in this chapter so far had a common goal: schedule development.
   Therefore, the major output items of all the processes discussed in this chapter are the input
   to the schedule development process.


Input to Schedule Development
   The following output items from the schedule-related processes discussed in this chapter
   directly support the schedule development process:
           Activity list and activity attributes
           Project schedule network diagrams showing the dependencies among activities
           Activity resource requirements and resource calendars
           Activity duration estimates
128   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        The project scope statement and two other input items that can be useful in ways are described
        in the following list.
        Project scope statement. The assumptions and constraints in the project scope statement can
        affect the project schedule and therefore must be considered in developing the schedule. The
        following two types of time-related constraints should get special attention.
             Hard deadlines for start and finish dates. Some activities or work packages might
             have constraints on their start or finish dates. For example, there might be a situa-
             tion in which an activity cannot be started before a certain date, or must be finished
             before a certain date, or both. Where do these date constraints come from? They can
             come from various sources, such as a date in the contract, a date determined by the
             market window, a date determined by delivery of material from an external vendor,
             and the like.
             Time constraints on deliverables. These constraints can come from the customer,
             the sponsor, or any other stakeholder in terms of deadlines for certain major deliver-
             ables or milestones. Other projects inside or outside your organization might be
             depending on these constraints. So, once scheduled, these deadlines are constraints
             and can only be changed through the approval process.
        Enterprise environmental factors and process assets. Scheduling tools are an example of
        enterprise environmental factors and scheduling methodology and project calendars are exam-
        ples of organizational process assets that can be useful in developing the schedule.
        To summarize, the output of various time management processes is used as input to the sched-
        ule development process, which uses a variety of tools and techniques to iron out the project
        schedule.


   Tools and Techniques for Schedule Development
        Once you have the network diagrams for the activities, as well as the activity duration estimates,
        you are well equipped to start scheduling the project. The remaining main concerns include
        the following:
                The actual start date
                Uncertainty of the availability of resources
                Identification of and preparation for activities on the critical path
                Risks involved or what-if scenarios
                The hard start/finish dates for activities or for the project that came down the
                pipeline from very important stakeholders
        Various tools and techniques discussed in the following sections can be used to address these
        concerns while you are hammering out the project schedule.

  Schedule Network Analysis
  Schedule network analysis is a technique used to generate a project schedule by identifying the
  early and late start and finish dates for the project. The analysis accomplishes this task by using
  various analytical techniques, such as critical path method, critical chain method, what-if analy-
  sis, and resource leveling. These techniques are discussed in the following list.
  Critical path method. This is the schedule network analysis technique used to identify the
  schedule flexibility and the critical path of the project schedule network diagram. The critical
  path is the longest path (sequence of activities) in a project schedule network diagram. Because
  it is the longest path, it determines the duration of the project and hence the finish date of the
  project given the start date. An example will explain this. Consider the network diagram pre-
  sented in Figure 4.9. The boxes in the figure represent activities, such as Activity A followed
  by Activity B, and the number on top of a box represents the duration of the activity in time
  units, such as days.




      FIGURE 4.9 An example of a project schedule network diagram. The duration of an activity is
                     represented by the number shown on top of the box that represents the activity.

  Table 4.1 shows the calculations for the duration of each path of the network diagram by adding
  the durations of the individual activities on the path. You can see from Table 4.1 that Start-F-
  G-H-Finish is the critical path because it is the longest path in the diagram, at 21 days. This
  means if the project start date is January 2, the project finish date will be January 23 (2+21),
  given that the duration is shown in calendar time units.
  The second important feature of the critical path method is to identify the flexibility in the
  project schedule by calculating the early and late start and finish dates of each activity on each
  path. The schedule flexibility of an activity is measured by the positive difference between the
  late start date and the early start date for the activity and is called float time or total float.

        Table 4.2 shows calculations for the early and late start and finish dates and the float time for
        each activity in the network diagram being analyzed. The early start and finish dates of activ-
        ities on a path are calculated by using the forward-pass method, which means you start your
        calculations from the start point (leftmost) and make your way forward.

  As an example, consider the path Start-A-B-Finish in the network diagram shown in Figure
  4.9. Because A is the first activity on the path, its early start is Day 0. Because B depends on
  the completion of A, and A takes 5 days to finish, the early start date for B is the early start
  date of A plus the duration of A--that is, 0+5=5. The late start and finish dates are calculated
  using the backward-pass method, which means you start your calculations from the finish point.
  The project finish date determined by the critical path is Day 21, given that the project start
  date is Day 0. Because Activity B has a duration of 3 days, it must be started no later than Day
  18 (21-3=18). Therefore, Day 18 is the late start date of Activity B. Activity A has a duration
  of 5 days, so given that B must start on Day 18, A must not start later than Day 13 (18-5=13).
  Therefore the late start date for A is Day 13. The float times are calculated as follows:
          Float time for A = late start - early start = 13-0 = 13
          Float time for B = late start - early start = 18-5 = 13
  Note that each of the activities on the critical path (F, G, and H) has a float time of zero. This
  obviously is a source of schedule risk.


               NOTE
        Each activity on a critical path has zero float time and therefore poses a schedule
        risk. So, you must monitor the activities on all critical paths very closely during the
        execution of the project.



  Critical chain method. This is an alternative schedule network analysis technique that takes
  into account the uncertainties of the activity durations due the uncertainty of the availability
  of resources. It uses schedule network diagrams to identify the critical paths and the schedule
  flexibility, just like the critical path method. The only difference is that in this technique, you
  work from more than one network diagram. For example, the durations in the first network
  are based on the planned scenario regarding the availability of resources. You can draw another
  network diagram based on the pessimistic scenario regarding the availability of resources. The
  durations of some activities in the second diagram will be longer than the first diagram, and
  the second diagram might even have a different or an additional critical path. The extra dura-
  tions in the second diagram are called duration buffers. So, the focus of the critical chain method
  is on managing the duration buffers and the uncertainties in the availability of resources applied
  to the planned schedule activities.
  Resource leveling. Resource leveling is not an independent schedule network analysis method.
  It is applied to the schedule that has already been analyzed using other methods, such as the
  critical path method or the critical chain method. The resource leveling technique is applied
  to address the resource needs of activities that must be performed to meet specific delivery
  dates. Resource leveling involves taking a part of the resources from one activity and assigning
  it to another. This will change the activity durations and can also result in a change of critical
  paths.
132   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        What-if scenario analysis. The purpose of what-if scenario analysis is to calculate the effects
        of a specific scenario on the schedule--for example, how the schedule will be affected if a ven-
        dor does not make the delivery of a major component on the promised date. Because a what-
        if scenario by definition represents uncertainty, this analysis often leads to risk planning, which
        might include changing the schedule or changing the network diagram to get a few activities
        out of harm's way if possible.
        As you have seen, the critical path method is used to develop a schedule for given resources,
        whereas the critical chain method factors in the uncertainty of the availability of the resources.
        The resource leveling technique is used to move the resources around to meet the resource needs
        of the activities that must be accomplished on a specific date. In other words, in an ideal world
        in which the required (or planned) resources are guaranteed, you do not need the critical chain
        method and resource leveling; just the critical path method will do.
        Let's assume you have used the critical path method to determine the schedule for a project.
        You have also applied other techniques, such as the critical chain method and resource level-
        ing. The final realistic schedule that you have come up with has an unacceptable project dura-
        tion (the length of the critical path). What do you do? This is where the schedule compression
        technique comes to your rescue.


        Schedule Compression
        Schedule compression is an attempt to shorten the project schedule without changing the pro-
        ject scope. It may be necessary in order to deal with schedule-related constraints and objec-
        tives. It is true that you, the project manager, build the schedule through cold, hard
        mathematical analysis, and you don't just accept whatever schedule goals come down the
        pipeline from elsewhere, such as from the customer or the project sponsor. However, once you
        have the schedule built through analysis, you can attempt to accommodate some critical stake-
        holder expectations or hard deadlines, such as a predetermined project finish date. I have already
        discussed one such method, called resource leveling, to accommodate hard deadlines for activ-
        ities. In this section, I will discuss two more methods for schedule compression: crashing and
        fast tracking.
        Crashing. This is a project schedule compression technique in which cost and schedule trade-
        offs are analyzed to decrease the project duration with minimal additional cost. A number of
        alternatives are analyzed, including the assignment of additional resources. Approving overtime
        is another example of crashing.
        Fast tracking. This is a project schedule compression technique used to decrease the project
        duration by performing project phases or some schedule activities within a phase in parallel that
        would normally be performed in sequence. For example, testing of a product can start when
        some of its components are finished, rather than waiting for the whole product to be completed.
 PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                       Chapter 4         133



               TIP
         Crashing usually involves assigning more resources and hence increasing the cost.
         However, guard yourself against the misconception that additional resources will lin-
         early improve the performance. For example, if one programmer can develop a pro-
         gram in eight days, it does not necessarily mean that two programmers will develop
         the same program in four days, because there will be overheads, such as the initial
         less-productive stage of the newly assigned resource, the time taken to reallocate the
         work, the interaction among the resources, and so on.



   Other Tools and Techniques
   In addition to the main techniques to develop the project schedule, which I already discussed,
   there are some other tools and techniques for developing the project schedule that I will dis-
   cuss in this list.
   Applying leads and lags. Just like in the activity sequencing process, leads and lags can be
   applied during the development of project schedule. If you applied some leads and lags during
   the activity sequencing process, it is time to consider whether you need to adjust those. This
   adjustment might be necessary to create a realistic schedule.
   Project management software. After you have the data for the schedule development created
   by the processes discussed in this chapter, it is a common practice to use project management
   software to build the actual schedule. Because they are automated, the scheduling tools expe-
   dite the scheduling process and reduce the probability of errors in the schedule.
   In a nutshell, the main techniques to develop a project schedule include network diagram analy-
   sis (critical path method and critical chain method), schedule compression (fast tracking and
   crashing), and resource leveling. You use these techniques to generate the output of the sched-
   ule development process.


Output of the Schedule Development Process
   The planned project schedule is an obvious output of the schedule development process. This
   and other output items are discussed in this list.
   Project schedule. The project schedule includes a planned start date and a planned finish date
   for each schedule activity. The schedule will be considered preliminary until the resources have
   been assigned to perform the activities according to the schedule. Although a schedule for a
134   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        simple project might be presented in a tabular form, typically a project schedule is presented
        in one of the following graphical formats:
             Project schedule network diagram. These diagrams present the schedule activities
             on a timescale with a start and a finish date for each activity and hence show the
             dependencies of activities on each other. Because they show the dependencies--that
             is, the logic--they are also called logic charts.
             Bar chart. In these charts the activities are represented by bars, with each bar show-
             ing the start date, the finish date, and the duration of the activity. They are easy to
             read and are often used in presentations.
             Milestone chart. These are typically the bar charts representing only the milestones,
             not all the schedule activities.
        Schedule data. This is the supporting data for the project schedule and consists of the
        following:
             The essential data consists of schedule activities, schedule milestones, activity attrib-
             utes, and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints.
             Resource requirements by time periods.
             Alternative schedules--for example, schedules based on best-case and worst-case
             scenarios.
             Schedule contingency reserves.



                      TIP
                The schedule data may be enriched by items such as delivery schedules, order
                schedules, and resource histograms depending on the nature of the project.



        This data is used to create the version of the schedule that is approved by the project manage-
        ment team and becomes the schedule baseline.
        Schedule baseline. This is a specific version of the project schedule that is accepted and
        approved by the project management team as a baseline against which the progress of the pro-
        ject will be measured. This version of the schedule is developed from the schedule network
        analysis described earlier.
        Updates to project documents. During the process of developing the schedule, updates to the
        following documents may happen:
             Resource requirements. The schedule development process might change the initial
             estimate for the types and quantities of required resources.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                         Chapter 4        135


         Activity attributes. Resource requirements or any other activity attributes that have
         changed must be updated.
         Project calendar. Any update to the project calendar must be documented. For
         example, each project may use different calendar units in the project schedule.


                NOTE
          Project schedule development is an iterative process. For example, it might be neces-
          sary to review and revise the duration and resource estimates for some activities to
          create a project schedule that will be approved. The approved project schedule will
          act as a baseline against which project progress will be tracked.



    As mentioned earlier, the approved project schedule is used as a baseline to track the project
    progress. To some extent, the schedule development (or modification) continues throughout
    the project execution due to the approved changes and the risk occurrences.

                              the results from the analyzer, and when the results will be pub-

    While developing the project schedule, you will be doing lots of communication. Managing
    project communication is indeed very critical to the project success.
136   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT



   Managing Project Communication:
   Big Picture
        There is a common thread that runs through almost all activities and processes in project man-
        agement, and that is communication. The project and its activities will fail without effective
        communication. Communication is an exchange of information among persons and groups by
        using an effectively common system of signs, symbols, and behavior. I used the term "effectively
        common" to take into account the fact that even if two communicating entities are using two
        different systems, the "translators" between the communicating entities produce the results as
        if the two entities were using a common system. For example, I might be using a Windows
        computer and you might be using a Macintosh, but we can exchange e-mails without having
        to deal with the differences between the two machines.



                      TIP
                Communication is a common thread that runs through almost all activities and
                processes in project management.



        The importance of communication in project management cannot be overemphasized. Even a
        well-scheduled and well-funded project can fail in the hands of a hardworking team of experts
        due to the lack of proper communication. As a project manager, you may be dealing with a wide
        functional variety of individuals, ranging from executives, to marketing personnel, to sales folks,
        to technologists. You should be able to wear different communication hats depending upon
        who you are communicating with. For example, you will not be talking in terms of technical
        jargon with executives or marketing folks, and you will not speak marketing lingo to software
        developers. You will be speaking to different stakeholders in their language, while filling the
        language gap between different functional groups and eliminating misunderstandings due to
        miscommunication. The key point is that you put on the appropriate communication hat
        depending on which individual you are communicating with. Be able to switch communica-
        tion hats quickly and avoid technical jargon and acronyms that are not understood by the per-
        son or the group you are communicating with. The goal is the clarity of the language to convey
        the message accurately.
        In a project, you will be communicating with project stakeholders. The different components
        of project communication management are illustrated in Figure 4.10.
        In this chapter we discuss communication in general and how to plan for it. Other compo-
        nents of communication management will be discussed in forthcoming chapters.

      FIGURE 4.10 Big picture of project communication management.



               TIP
        The major goal of communication management is to deliver the right information to
        the right stakeholders at the right time by using the right communication means to
        produce the desired impact.




Planning Project Communication
  In a project environment, communication means communicating with the project stakehold-
  ers. Plan Communication is the process of determining the information needs of the project
  stakeholders and accordingly designing the communication approach.
  To be specific, communication planning determines the following:
       The communication and information needs of the program stakeholders
       The four Ws: what information is needed, when it is needed, who needs it, and who
       will deliver it
       How the information will be delivered--for example, by e-mail, phone call, or
       presentation
  In Chapter 2, you learned how to identify stakeholders. During the process of identifying stake-
  holders, you create the stakeholder register and develop the stakeholder management strategy.
  Both of these items are used in planning the project communication.
138   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT



                      CAUTION
                Planning communication is the process of determining the information needs of the
                project stakeholders and accordingly the communication approach. Misplanning will
                produce undesired results, such as incorrect individuals getting sensitive information,
                necessary information not getting to the right stakeholders in time, wrong communi-
                cation methods being used, and so on.



        As mentioned earlier, the stakeholder register and stakeholder management strategy devel-
        oped during the Identify Stakeholders process will be the major input into the Plan Commu-
        nication process illustrated in Figure 4.11. Also, because communication is the common thread
        running through the whole project and because it must be adapted to the whole project envi-
        ronment, all the enterprise environmental factors and all the organizational process assets
        should be considered as input. Historical information and lessons learned are particularly
        important because they can be used for wisely planning the communication based on past
        experience.




            FIGURE 4.11 The Plan Communication process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

        With these documents and past experience at hand, it's important to use some tools and tech-
        niques to finalize the communication plan.


   Tools and Techniques for Communication Planning
        Recall that communication is transferring information from one point to another. It expends
        resources. To optimize the use of resources and the benefits of communication, you need to
        analyze the communication requirements and determine the communication technology to be
        used. These and other relevant tools and techniques are discussed in the following sections.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                          Chapter 4       139


  Communication Requirements Analysis
  Communication requirements, needed for the communication planning process, must be ana-
  lyzed. This analysis will generate the communication needs of the project stakeholders. For
  example, a communication requirement may specify the type of information and the format in
  which this information should be delivered. The analysis of this requirement will estimate the
  value of this communication requirement--for example, fulfillment of this requirement will
  significantly contribute to the success of the project, or the lack of it will result in the failure
  of the project or one of its components. So, one of the purposes of communication require-
  ments analysis is to optimize the use of resources in communication.



               TIP
        Communication requirements need to be analyzed to generate the communication
        needs of the project stakeholders. This is important for optimal use of the communi-
        cation resources and for project success.


  Following are some examples of what types of information you will need to analyze the com-
  munication requirements for your project:
       Relationships. Organizational and stakeholder responsibility relationships. Organi-
       zational charts can be helpful to figure out some of this information.
       Groups. Different groups, disciplines, departments, and specialties involved in this
       project--for example, marketing, sales, and engineering as departments and software
       engineering and testing as groups in the engineering department.
       Logistics. How many individuals and groups will be involved in the project and where
       they are located. Obviously, this information is necessary to plan communication.
       Information needs. Communication is performed to deliver or exchange some kind
       of information. So to plan communication effectively, it's important to know the fol-
       lowing information needs:
        Information needs of the stakeholders
        Internal information needs--for example, communication across the performing
           organization and communication within the project team
        External information needs--for example, communicating with contractors,
           media, and the public
  You can appreciate the complexity of communication by realizing that there are n(n-1)/2 pos-
  sible communication channels among n stakeholders, as discussed earlier in this chapter. For
  example, if there are 20 stakeholders, the possible number of communication channels is
  20x19/2=190.
  Based on communication needs, you can determine which communication technology will be
  appropriate to meet these needs.
140   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Communication Technology Determination
        Depending on the communication needs and the nature of the information, a communication
        technology may vary from a conversation in a hallway to a sophisticated information system.
        The following factors can contribute to determining the communication technology to be
        used for your project:
             Availability. If you are considering a number of options, obviously the technology
             that's already in place is more likely to be chosen.
             Project environment. The project environment can also affect the choice of com-
             munication technology. For example, the communication technology requirements
             for a project team that meets face to face will be different from that of a virtual
             team.
             Project length. The length of the project affects communication technology require-
             ments in the following ways:
              Is it worth it to spend time on a technology for the given length of the project?
              Will the technology under consideration change during the course of the pro-
                 ject? If yes, that will mean extra cost for the new technology and for training the
                 team members to use it.
             Urgency of the information need. How frequently the information needs to be
             updated will also play a role in determining the communication technology. For
             example, information that does not need to change frequently can be delivered in
             written reports, whereas information that can change very frequently can be deliv-
             ered through web pages.
             Staffing preparation level. Another factor that can be considered in making the
             communication technology decision is the users' (project team and other stakehold-
             ers) level of preparation for using a given technology. Are the users already fluent in
             this technology or will they need to be trained? Training and learning for the project
             staff could be the valid issues on the table.


                      NOTE
                The factors that can contribute to determining the communication technology to be
                used include availability, project environment, project length, urgency of the informa-
                tion need, and preparation level.



        Communication Models and Methods
        If you have some experience in IT or in the field of communication, be aware that when PMI
        refers to communication models and methods, it has very specific things in mind. Although
        it's a very broad topic, we will confine our discussion to what PMI means by communication
        models and methods, for the purpose of the exam.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                Chapter 4         141


  Communication models. PMI's basic communication model is illustrated in Figure 4.12, and
  its different components are explained in the following list:
       Sender. The individual that initiates the communication by sending the original
       message.
       Receiver. The individual that receives the original message sent by the sender.
       Encode. To convert thoughts into a format that can be sent as a message to the
       receiver.
       Message. Encoded piece of information that travels from one individual to another.
       Feedback message. The response sent by the receiver to the sender. It may be a sim-
       ple acknowledgment or it may be a full message that may require a response.
       Decode. To convert the encoded message back into thoughts and ideas upon which
       one could act.
       Medium. The means of communication used to send and receive the message.
       E-mail, telephone, and face-to-face conversation are some examples of media.
       Noise. While the message travels through the medium, it can be interrupted and
       modified by some interfering entity called noise. Anything that interferes with the
       transmission and understanding of the message is called noise. Some examples are
       distance, lack of background information or context in which the message is com-
       posed, and unfamiliar technology being used. For example, e-mailing and texting
       have their own lingo, acronyms, and symbols that can become noise for people who
       are new to these technologies.




      FIGURE 4.12 Basic communication model as viewed by PMI.
142     Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


          For the communication to work, both the senders and the receivers have some responsibili-
          ties. The responsibilities of the sender include ensuring that the message being sent conveys
          the complete information clearly and ensuring that the information is received correctly and
          understood properly by the receiver. The responsibilities of the receiver include ensuring that
          the information is received correctly and understood properly in its entirety and that it is
          acknowledged.

                                      dem repeats (VNTR) and central dogma of molecular biology.
        F. Feedback                 6 The sponsor responded to Lora expressing his concern that he
                                      could not exactly understand her concerns.



          Communication methods. In its most basic form, communication is an exchange of informa-
          tion between two entities. Even communication among several entities is better handled by
          looking at it as a set of exchanges between two entities. For example, A communicating with
          B, C, and D is a set of exchanges between A and B, A and C, and A and D. In other words,
          exchange between two entities is the basic building block of communication. So we can always
          break down a communication as an exchange between a sender and a receiver.
          From the perspective of how the sender and the receiver are involved with each other through
          the communication system, communication can be classified into the following two categories:
             1.   Interactive communication. In this type of communication, the receiver receives the
                  message and sends a response to it. This way, the communicating entities keep switch-
                  ing the roles of sender and receiver. There are two kinds of interactive communication:
                     Asynchronous communication. A communication in which the two communi-
                       cating entities do not have to be present on both ends of the communication line
                       at the same time. E-mail is an example of asynchronous communication because
                       when the sender of the e-mail pushes the send button, the intended recipient of
                       the e-mail message does not have to be logged on to the e-mail server. The
                       recipient can log on later, retrieve the message, and read it.
 PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                        Chapter 4          143


               Synchronous communication. A communication in which the two communi-
               cating entities have to be present on both ends of the communication line at the
               same time. It's a live, real-time communication--if you are not present when the
               sender is sending the message, you miss the message. Speaking with someone
               face to face and conversing with someone on the phone are two examples of syn-
               chronous communication.
     2.      One-way communication. There are two kinds of one-way communication:
                Pull communication. In this kind of communication, the receiver pulls the
                   information from a pool of information. Downloading from websites is an exam-
                   ple of this communication.
                Push communication. In this kind of communication, the sender broadcasts the
                   information to a set of entities without waiting for the request of information
                   and without the need to confirm that the information reached its destination.
                   Marketing e-mails and letters are examples of push communication.
             The pull and push methods can also be used in conjunction with each other. For
             example, the sender can also push the information to a pool, and the receivers can pull
             it from there at their own convenience.

   Communication types discussed here are called communication methods in the PMI Standard.
   Depending on the purpose, the project manager can decide which of these communication
   methods to use. Quite often a hybrid approach is used in the real world--that is, a mix of
   more than one method.
   You use these tools and techniques to generate the output of the communication planning
   process.


Output of Communication Planning
   The major output of communication planning is the communication management plan. This
   and other output items are discussed in this section.


   Communication Management Plan
   This is the document that describes the communication expectations, needs, and plans for the
   project. It specifies what information will be communicated, when and how it will be commu-
   nicated, and who will communicate it and to whom. It includes the following:
              Communication requirements of the project stakeholders
              Information to be communicated: content, format, and level of detail
              Who will communicate the information, who will receive it, and why
              The person responsible for authorizing the release of confidential information
144   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Methods of communication that will be used, such as e-mail, presentation, and press
             release
             The frequency of communication, such as daily or weekly
             The method and procedure for escalating the issues that cannot be resolved at a
             lower staff level, such as project level
             A glossary of common communication terminology
             Methods and procedures for updating and refining the communication management
             plan if needed as the program progresses
             Communication constraints
        The communication management plan may also include the technology requirements plan.
        Executing a project in this information age, more likely than not, you will need multiple tech-
        nologies for communication, such as e-mail, web calendars, and video conferencing. There-
        fore, it is important that you plan for the communication technology requirements. This
        planning has two components: the tools that are needed and the usage of those tools. To deter-
        mine which tools are needed, ask questions such as the following:
             How frequently do you need to update the information?
             Will the team hold face-to-face or virtual meetings?
        For the information that does not change often, the written reports will be sufficient, whereas
        the information that needs to be updated frequently and on a moment's notice needs web
        communication tools. To plan effective usage of the tools, ask the following questions:
             Are the tools (communication systems) already in place and ready to be used?
             Will the available communication tools change before the program ends?
             Are the team members familiar with the tools or do they need training to use them?



                      TIP
                The communication management plan describes the communication expectations,
                needs, and plans for the project.



        Updates to Project Documents
        During communication planning, you might realize that you need to make some changes in
        the project schedule, stakeholder register, and stakeholder management strategy. Accordingly,
        you will need to change these documents.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                         Chapter 4       145



               TIP
        While planning for communication (or doing anything, for that matter), pay attention to
        details, ask questions, and probe the situation to come to a better understanding. A
        well understood problem is already half solved. Be an active and effective listener.


  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
       Various time management processes are used to produce schedule data--a list of
       schedule activities and attributes for each activity, such as required resources and the
       duration of the activity.
       The schedule data is used to develop the project schedule, which is an iterative
       process due to the uncertainties in the schedule data and due to the changes during
       the project execution. Nevertheless, the approved version of the planned schedule is
       used as a baseline to track the project progress.
       Communication is a common thread that runs through the project lifecycle. It's
       important to develop a communication plan in order to ensure that the communica-
       tion mantra is implemented: Deliver right information to the right people at the
       right time by using the right communication methods to produce the desired
       impact.



Summary
  Project schedule development is a journey that begins with decomposing the work packages in
  the WBS to project activities and ends with an approved schedule for performing those activ-
  ities. Schedule planning addresses some basic questions: What are the activities that need to
  be performed to complete the project, who is going to perform these activities, and when?
  The Define Activities process is used to decompose the work packages in the WBS into
  schedule activities. The resulting activity list is used by the activity sequencing process to gen-
  erate network diagrams, which display the dependencies among the activities. The commonly
  used method to construct network diagrams is the precedence diagramming method (PDM).
  The activity list and attributes are also used to determine the resource requirements for the pro-
  ject. Given the available resource, you can estimate the activity duration--that is, the time it
  will take to perform the activity.
  By using various time-management processes discussed in this chapter, you identify schedule
  activities, arrange them in proper sequence, determine resource requirements for them, and esti-
  mate their durations. All these tasks and accomplishments are a means to an end called the
  Develop Schedule process. You typically use the critical path method to develop the project
146   Part II         PLANNING THE PROJECT


        schedule from a network diagram. After you have a schedule, you can use schedule compres-
        sion methods, such as fast tracking and crashing, to accommodate hard deadlines. Schedule
        development is an iterative process that can continue well into the project execution due to
        approved changes and risk occurrences. However, the approved planned project schedule is used
        as a baseline to track the project progress.
        Communication, the lifeline of the project, is a common thread that runs through the whole
        lifecycle of the project. Therefore it's crucial to plan for communication management as early
        as possible. The output of the Plan Communication process is the communication manage-
        ment plan that describes the communication needs and expectations of the project and how to
        meet them.
        So, now that you have a project schedule and you have planned communication, are you ready
        to execute the project? Well, not really. You need resources, such as human resources that will
        do the project work and funding to get the human resources. You need to plan for these
        resources. This is the topic of the next chapter.


        Exam's Eye View
         Comprehend

          The major task of the Define Activities process is to generate the activity list (output) by
                decomposing (or arranging) the work packages of the WBS (input) into activities.

          The major task of the Sequence Activities process is to determine the dependencies among the
                activities in the activity list (input) and display those dependencies in the network diagrams
                (output).

          After the activity resource requirements have been determined, the duration for an activity can
                be estimated for a given resource.

          Network diagrams with activity durations assigned to each activity can be used to develop the
                schedule. The approved project schedule acts as a baseline against which the project progress is
                tracked.

          The Plan Communication process is used to develop the communication management plan.
PLANNING PROJECT SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATION                                               Chapter 4     147


   Look Out

    Activity duration is estimated for a given resource committed to the activity. Changing the
       quantity of the resource will change the duration estimate.

    Activity duration measured in work periods does not include holidays, whereas duration mea-
       sured in calendar units does. For example, the activity duration from Friday to the following
       Tuesday is three days when measured in work units and five days when measured in calendar
       units, given that no work is done on Saturday and Sunday.

    Each activity on a critical path has zero float time and thus poses a schedule risk. Therefore,
       you must monitor the activities on all critical paths very closely during the execution of the
       project.

   Memorize

    The communication management plan, generated as an output of the Plan Communication
       process, becomes a component of the project management plan.

    The approved project schedule, called the schedule baseline, becomes part of the project manage-
       ment plan.

    In PDM, finish to start is the most commonly used dependency relationship, whereas start to
       finish is the least used.

    Fast tracking compresses the schedule by performing activities simultaneously that would oth-
       erwise be performed in sequence, whereas crashing compresses the schedule by assigning more
       resources.

             duration by performing project phases or some schedule activities within a phase
             simultaneously, when they would normally be performed in sequence.
             float time. The positive difference between the late start date and the early start date
             of a schedule activity.
             lag. A technique to modify a dependency relationship by delaying the successor
             activity. For example, a lag of five days in a finish-to-start relationship means the
             successor activity cannot start until five days after the predecessor activity has ended.
             lead. A technique to modify a dependency relationship by accelerating the successor
             activity. For example, a lead of five days in a finish-to-start relationship means the
             successor activity can start up until five days before the finish date of the predecessor
             activity.
             logical relationship. A dependency between two project schedule activities or
             between a schedule activity and a schedule milestone.
             milestone. A significant point (or event) in the life of a project.

      parametric estimating. A quantitative technique used to calculate the activity dura-
      tion when the productivity rate of the resource performing the activity is available.
      planning component. A WBS component at the bottom level of a branch of the
      WBS hierarchy for which some planning can be performed.
      precedence diagramming method (PDM). A technique used to construct a project
      schedule network diagram in which a node (a box) represents an activity and an
      arrow represents the dependency relationship.
      project calendar. A calendar of working days or shifts used to establish when a
      schedule activity can be performed. A calendar typically specifies holidays and week-
      ends when a schedule activity cannot be performed.
      project schedule. A schedule that consists of planned dates for performing schedule
      activities and meeting schedule milestones.
      project schedule network diagram. A schematic display of logical relationships

      required to complete the schedule activities of a project.
      role. A defined function that contains a set of responsibilities to be performed by a
      team member, such as a programmer or a tester.
      rolling wave planning. A technique used to plan the project work at various levels of
      detail, depending upon the availability of information. Work to be performed in the
      near future is planned at a low level of the WBS, whereas work to be performed far
      into the future is planned at a relatively high level of the WBS.

   6.   Why should you monitor the activities on the critical path more closely?
         A. Because each activity on the critical path has a zero float time and thereby poses
            a schedule risk.
         B. Because the activities on the critical path need to be performed before the activ-
            ities on other paths.
         C. Because the activities on the critical path are critical to the organization's strategy.
         D. Because the activities on noncritical paths depend upon the activities on the
            critical path.

                       curements, and planning for quality. In this chapter,
                       we cover the planning processes related to resources
                       and procurement needed to complete the project.
Introduction
  Once you have developed the project schedule, as discussed in the previous chapter, you need
  resources to execute the schedule. For example, you need the team members--the human
  resources--to perform the project activities, such as a computer programmer to design and
  develop a program. Furthermore, you also need financial resources to support these human
  resources and to make purchases and acquisitions required for the project. These financial
  resources are managed in the form of cost in project management. Some of the expected out-
  come items of the project will be developed by the project team, and others will be purchased
  or acquired in a process called procurement, which may also include items that are needed to
  complete the project and are not necessarily the end product of the project.
  So, the core question in this chapter is: How do you plan for the project resources? This issue
  breaks down into three avenues that we will explore: human resource planning, cost planning,
  and procurement planning.



Planning for Resources: Big Picture
  As you learned in the previous chapter, resource requirements are estimated by using the Esti-
  mate Activity Resources process, and the schedule is developed by using the Develop Sched-
  ule process. As illustrated in Figure 5.1, the activity resource requirements estimated this way
  are used to develop the human resource plan for the project. The human resource plan and the
  project schedule, in turn, are used to make cost estimates for activities, which are aggregated
  to determine the project budget.
  The approved budget with a timeline assigned to it is called the cost baseline, against which the
  project performance is measured. This baseline is also used to plan for procurements--that is,
  purchases and acquisitions that are needed to complete the project but cannot be produced by
  the project team.
  While developing the project schedule, the availability of resources required to perform the
  schedule activities is an obvious assumption. An important category of resources is human
  resources--for example, a computer programmer who will write a computer program. You need
  to plan for these resources.
                      PLANNING FOR PROJECT RESOURCES                                  Chapter 5       157




      FIGURE 5.1 Relationships among major processes of resource planning.



Developing the Human Resource Plan
  In order to avoid confusion, you must understand the logical relationships among the project,
  activity resource requirements, roles, and responsibilities, as illustrated in Figure 5.2. Roles are
  determined from the resource requirements, and responsibilities are assigned to the roles to per-
  form the project activities. In a nutshell, project work is generally performed in the form of
  roles and responsibilities. Project roles, responsibilities of the roles, and reporting relationships
  among the roles need to be determined in order to perform a project. The usefulness of the
  concept of a role is that you can talk about it during planning, even before hiring a person who
  will play this role. So, a role is a defined function to be performed by a team member, such as
  a programmer or a tester. The other issue that needs to be addressed before the project can be
  performed is how and when the project team members (who will perform the project work)
  will be acquired. The human resource planning process addresses these issues.

            FIGURE 5.2 Relationships among the project, project activity requirements, roles, and
                          responsibilities.

        Therefore, two main goals of the human resource planning process are the following:
             Identify and document project roles, responsibilities for each role, and reporting rela-
             tionships among the roles.
             Develop the staff management plan.
        All this planning will go into a document called the human resource plan, which is developed
        by the Develop Human Resource Plan process illustrated in Figure 5.3.

Input to Human Resource Planning
   Before you can assign the resources to a project, you need to know the resource requirements
   of the project, which are the main items that you need to plan resources. The other two items
   are the familiar ones: enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets.
   Enterprise environmental factors. The enterprise environmental factors that can influence
   human resource planning include human resources that already exist in the organization and
   are available for the project, organizational culture, organizational structure, human resource
   and personnel administration policies of the organization, and marketplace conditions. For
   example, how do the different departments and the people within the performing organization
   interact with each other? This will have a profound effect on defining the roles and responsi-
   bilities. Overall, while planning human resources, you must consider the following enterprise
   environmental factors:
        Interpersonal. The interpersonal environmental factor should be explored while
        considering the candidates within the performing organization for the project team
        members. You should seek answers to interpersonal questions, such as the following:
         What are the job descriptions of the candidates? This will tell you what kind of
            project activities they might be able to perform.
         What are the skills and experiences of the candidates beyond their current job
            descriptions?
         What types of formal and informal reporting relationships exist among the can-
            didates? This will help determine who can fit in where.
         What cultural or language differences will possibly affect the working relation-
            ships among the candidates? This should be used to optimize the project work
            results by honoring cultural diversity.
        Logistical. The logistical factor deals with the issue of how the project team is
        spread out geographically. For example, a relevant question to ask is, are the team
        members spread out in different buildings, time zones, or countries? Virtual commu-
        nication, discussed in the next chapter, will be an important consideration here.
        Organizational. The organizational factor relevant to human resource planning can
        be identified by answering the following questions:
         Which departments of the performing organization will participate in the project?
         What are the current relationships between these departments? In other words,
            how do these departments interact?
        Political. Playing politics could be a dirty word for a social reformer, but you need to
        deal with it tactically by recognizing it as a project reality. To explore the effect of
        the political factor on human resource planning, you should ask questions such as
        the following:
         What are the individual goals and agendas of the project stakeholders?
         Which individuals or groups are influential in areas important to the project?
         What are the formal or informal alliances that exist between individuals or
            departments relevant to the project?
160   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Technical. Almost all the projects these days include the use of some kind of tech-
             nology. To explore the effects of technical factors on human resource planning, you
             should explore answers to questions such as:
              What are the technical specialties, such as software, programming languages, and
                technical equipment, needed to perform the project?
              Which of these specialties need to be coordinated?
              Are there any technical challenges this project might face?
        Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets that can be useful in human
        resource planning include checklists, templates, organizational standards and procedures, stan-
        dardized role descriptions, and historical information from previous projects. Some examples
        of checklists are common project roles in your organization, typical competencies, training pro-
        grams to consider, team ground rules, and safety considerations. Examples of templates include
        project organizational charts and standard conflict management approach. Conflict manage-
        ment is discussed in an upcoming chapter.
        Activity resource requirements. In the previous chapter, we explored the process of deter-
        mining the resource requirements for the schedule activities. These requirements include
        human resource requirements, which are needed to develop the human resource plan. The
        human resource requirements begin as preliminary requirements and are progressively elabo-
        rated during planning.
        The human resource requirements, a subset of activity resource requirements, are the raw mate-
        rial to determine the roles that will perform the activities. Various tools and techniques are avail-
        able to convert requirements into roles.


   Tools and Techniques for Human Resource Planning
        At the heart of resource planning lays the art of converting activities and activity resource
        requirements into roles and responsibilities. For example, consider an activity in a project--
        writing a software program. The program will be written by a programmer, which is a human
        resource. However, before you even know the name of the programmer, you can work with this
        programmer as a role whose main responsibility is to write the program, and you can assign a
        real individual to fill this role later. This approach allows for planning before hiring. The tools
        and techniques used to determine the roles for a project are discussed in the following list.
        Organizational charts and position descriptions. These charts identify and document the
        roles of the project team members, the responsibilities assigned to the roles, and the reporting
        relationships among the roles. Most of the chart formats fall into three categories--hierarchi-
        cal, matrix, and text-oriented.
             Hierarchical. Hierarchical charts are the traditional way to represent the reporting
             relationships in an organization in a top-down format. Such a chart is also called an
             organizational breakdown structure (OBS), and it is arranged according to the organi-
             zation's existing departments, units, or teams. The OBS will help you to identify
             team members for the project.

      Matrix. A matrix is used to specify the relationships between schedule activities,
      roles to perform those activities, and team members assigned to the roles. Such a
      matrix is generally called a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM). Different
      matrixes can show these relationships at different levels. For example, you can use
      the RAM to document resource requirements for each activity, as shown in Table
      5.1. For example, the second row of Table 5.1 shows that it will take six developers,
      six workstations on which the developers will work, and one server to perform
      Activity B. You can also use the RAM to document the specific responsibilities
      assigned to specific team members for the schedule activities, as shown in Table 5.2.

      Text-oriented charts. These charts are useful when the team member responsibili-
      ties need to be described in greater detail. A text-oriented chart may include infor-
      mation about role responsibilities, authority, competencies, and required
      qualifications. In the real world, these charts are known by different names, such as
      job descriptions and job responsibilities.


             CAUTION
      Information about some responsibilities of the human resources will be scattered
      across the project management plan. For example, the risk register lists the risk own-
      ers, and the communication management plan lists individuals responsible for some
      types of communications, such as status reports.


Depending upon the project needs, you can use both RAM and text-oriented charts to docu-
ment roles and responsibilities of those roles. Also, remember that the RAM can be used for
various purposes. For example, the RAM in Table 5.1 documents the resource requirements
for the schedule activities, while the RAM in Table 5.2 depicts the roles of team members for
schedule activities. In Table 5.2, letters are used as symbols to represent roles: R for responsi-
ble, A for accountable, C for consult, and I for inform.

        The RAM in Table 5.2 is also called the RACI chart because it assigns four roles to team mem-
        bers for various activities: responsible (R), accountable (A), consult (C), and inform (I). For
        example, Susan has the responsibility of designing the product, Cathleen will be held account-
        able for the design, Kiruba will play the role of a consultant for designing the product, while
        Pappu and Maya will play the role of keeping everybody informed of the status and progress.



                      TIP
                Each activity or task should have an owner who is responsible for its successful com-
                pletion. For complex tasks and activities, there may be more roles assigned, but there
                must be only one principle owner. Joint ownership usually gives rise to confusion, fin-
                ger pointing, conflict, more overhead, and dilution of commitment.



        Networking. Burn it in your head: Networking is one of the golden secrets you have for suc-
        ceeding as a project manager, especially in an organization in which functional managers hold
        all the powers (hiring, firing, bonuses) and the project managers are running around with
        nothing in their hands other than the project schedules and status reports. To network effec-
        tively, you should understand the influence of political and interpersonal factors in your orga-
        nization that might impact various staffing management options. Some of the essential
        networking happens at the beginning of each project, and you must make full use of it. How-
        ever, networking is a regular practice, and you should be using all the human resource network
        activities, such as proactive correspondence, informal conversations, luncheon meetings, and
        trade conferences.
        Organizational theories. Various organizational theories provide information and insight on
        how people behave in a team or an organization, what motivates team members, and the like.
        If you have knowledge of these theories, it will help you plan human resources quickly and use
        them more effectively. By understanding organizational theories, you can also comprehend why
        different organizational structures support different kinds of relationships among the organi-
        zation's members and different kinds of responses to the same situation.
                      PLANNING FOR PROJECT RESOURCES                                 Chapter 5          163


   To summarize, organizational charts, networking, and organizational theories are the main
   tools and techniques used to determine roles and develop the human resource plan.


Output of Human Resource Planning:
The Human Resource Plan
   The results of your efforts of human resource planning are documented in what is called the
   human resource plan. It's a document that describes roles and responsibilities, reporting rela-
   tionships among the roles, and staffing management. Following are the main elements of this
   document.
   Roles and responsibilities. This section contains roles and the responsibilities assigned to
   each role. The schedule project activities will be completed by individuals working in certain
   roles and performing responsibilities that come with the roles. So, roles and responsibilities are
   an important output of human resource planning. While determining roles and responsibili-
   ties, you must be clear about the following concepts:
        Role. In real life, most activities are performed by people playing certain roles, such
        as a parent, a teacher, or a student. Similarly, in project management, a role is essen-
        tially a set of responsibilities, such as the responsibilities of a developer, a tester, or a
        manager. A role is assigned to a team member who will perform the responsibilities
        included in the role to complete one or more project activities.
        Responsibility. A responsibility is a piece of work (task) that must be performed as
        part of completing a project activity. Responsibilities can be grouped together as a
        role.
        Competency. Competency is the ability of a team member to play a certain role--
        that is, to perform the responsibilities assigned to the role. While assigning a role to
        a team member, you should know whether the team member possesses the skills
        required to perform the responsibilities of the role. You might need to respond to a
        mismatch with training, hiring, schedule changes, or scope changes.
        Authority. Authority is a right assigned to a role that enables the person playing the
        role to apply project resources, make certain decisions, or sign approvals. Poorly
        defined or undefined authorities can cause confusion and conflicts.



                TIP
         Roles must be clarified by specifying the responsibilities and the authorities assigned
         to each role. A good match between the levels of responsibility and authority for each
         team member generally produces the best results. This gives the team members a
         sense of ownership. If you own it, you will less likely break it.
164   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Project organizational charts. A project organizational chart displays the project team mem-
        bers and the reporting relationships among them. The level of formality and detail of these
        charts depends upon the size and needs of the project at hand.
        Staffing management plan. After you have determined the roles to perform the activities, you
        need to identify individuals to fill those roles. The staff management plan describes when and
        how human resource requirements for a project will be met. When preparing the staff man-
        agement plan for your project, you must consider the following items:
             Staff acquisition. This will document how the staff for the project will be acquired.
             To be specific, while planning staff acquisition, you might need to struggle with
             some of the following questions:
              What are the levels of expertise needed for the project, and what are the assigned
                 costs?
              Will the human resources come from within the organization, outside the orga-
                 nization, or both?
              Will the team members be required to work in a central location, or can they
                 work from distant locations?
              Will you need the assistance of the human resources department of your organi-
                 zation to acquire the staff?
             Timetable and release criteria. You need to have a timetable for the human
             resource requirements, describing when and for how long a staff member is needed.
             The project schedule will help you determine that. The time commitment of human
             resources can be displayed in charts, such as resource histograms. A resource his-
             togram is a bar chart that illustrates the number of hours of a human resource entity
             needed each week or month during the project lifecycle. The human resource entity
             may refer to an individual, a department, or the whole project team. You should also
             determine the release criteria and the time to release each team member from the
             project. Planning of release criteria is very important for a smooth transition of team
             members from one project to another and for the optimal use of the resources.
             Training needs. If some team members lack the adequate level of skills needed for
             the project, a training plan can be developed as part of the project.
             Compliance and safety. The staff management plan can also include strategies for
             complying with relevant government regulations, union contracts, and human
             resource policies. Your organization might have some policies and procedures that
             protect the team members from safety hazards. These policies and procedures must
             be included in the staff management plan.
             Recognition and rewards. Recognition and rewards are good tools to promote and
             reinforce desired behavior. However, to use these tools effectively, you must have
             clear criteria for rewards based on activities and performance of team members. The
             potential candidate for a reward must have an appropriate level of control over the
             activity for which the reward will be offered. For example, if a team member is to be
             rewarded for completing the project within the budget, the team member must have
             an adequate level of control over the decision-making that affected the spending.
                      PLANNING FOR PROJECT RESOURCES                               Chapter 5       165


   In a nutshell, human resource planning accomplishes two things: It determines roles to per-
   form the schedule activities, and it develops a staff management plan to fill those roles with
   team members. All this information is stored in the document called the human resource plan.
   Human resources will cost you, and this leads us to cost management, which starts with mak-
   ing cost estimates, discussed next.



Estimating Costs and Determining
Budget
   First of all, we need to distinguish between cost and budget. Cost is the value of the inputs
   that have been (or will be) used up to perform a task or to produce an item: product, service,
   or result. This value is usually measured in units of money. For example, you paid two pro-
   grammers $500 each for developing a software program, and you paid $100 to a tester to test
   the program. So, the cost for the task of developing and testing the software program is
   $1,100. You can add the costs of components of a system, and the sum will represent the cost
   of the system, but it's still a cost and not a budget. Budget is an aggregated cost with a time-
   line. You aggregate the costs of all the resources needed to perform the project and put a time-
   line on it: the availability of funds over time. That is called a budget.
   As illustrated in Figure 5.4, cost management consists of estimating project costs, determin-
   ing budget from the cost estimates, and controlling the cost while the project is being exe-
   cuted. In this chapter, we explore estimating costs and determining budget. Cost control is
   discussed in forthcoming chapters.




       FIGURE 5.4 Big picture of cost management.

   Cost management starts with making cost estimates.


Estimating Project Costs
   Estimating project cost means developing an estimate for the monetary resources needed to
   complete the project work--that is, activities. These estimates are based on the information
   available at a given time. The estimates in the beginning are less accurate--for example, their
   accuracy may be only as good as 50 percent. For example, if you say the cost will be $50,000,
166   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        it could be anywhere between $25,000 and $75,000. As the project moves along and more
        information becomes available, the cost estimates can be improved to get better estimates.
        The standard process used to estimate costs is called the Estimate Costs process and is illustrated
        in Figure 5.5. Estimating project cost means estimating the costs required to complete the
        project scope by executing schedule activities. Therefore, you need the scope baseline and the
        schedule baseline for estimating costs. Recall that the scope baseline is constituted by the
        scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary, and the schedule baseline is the approved
        project schedule. These and other items that you may need to determine costs are discussed in
        the following list:
             Human resource plan. The information in the human resource plan useful for esti-
             mating costs includes the list of roles and responsibilities, personnel rates, and recog-
             nitions and rewards.
             Project schedule. An approved project schedule will give you the information about
             the resources needed to complete the project work. This information is crucial to
             make cost estimates. As you learned in the previous chapter, activity resources are
             estimated by performing the Estimate Activity Resources process. Therefore, the
             Estimate Costs process should be closely coordinated with the Estimate Activity
             Resources process, which in turn depends on the Estimate Activity Durations
             process because an activity duration is determined for the given resources.
             Scope baseline. All three components of the scope baseline--scope statement,
             WBS, and WBS dictionary--are useful in estimating the project cost. The scope
             statement will provide the cost-relevant information, such as project and product
             acceptance criteria, assumptions and constraints, product description, key deliver-
             ables, and project boundaries around the scope. An example of a cost-related
             assumption is whether you are only counting the direct cost of the project or you are
             also counting the indirect cost. The indirect costs are those costs that cannot be
             directly traced to a specific project and therefore are usually shared by multiple pro-
             jects and determined by some approved accounting procedure. An example would be

     the utility bill of the building or a computer network shared by many projects in the
     company. The WBS will be useful by providing the relationships among the differ-
     ent components of the projects that must be understood to make the cost estimates.
     The WBS dictionary will provide the description of the work.
     Risk register. Both kinds of risks--threats and opportunities--have an impact on
     the cost in the form of risk mitigation costs and revenues or savings from the
     opportunities.
     Enterprise environmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors relevant to esti-
     mating costs include market conditions and published commercial information that
     will provide the cost of resources, including human resources, materials, and equip-
     ment. This will also provide the information related to the availability of products
     and services and their cost and rates. Supply and demand conditions can also influ-
     ence the project cost.
     Organizational process assets. This includes the organization's policies regarding
     cost estimates, cost estimating templates, and information from previous projects,
     including lessons learned.
Some tools and techniques that can be used in cost estimating and budgeting are discussed in
the following paragraphs.
Analogous estimation. Analogous cost estimation is a technique that uses cost-related vari-
ables, such as rate, cost of a component, cost of an activity from similar tasks and activities in
previous projects, or cost of a similar project from the past, to measure the same variable in the
current project. This technique is useful when very limited component information is avail-
able, especially in the beginning of a project, and is usually used for estimating the gross val-
ues and not the detailed component-based values. It's generally less costly and less time
consuming than other techniques, but it also is less accurate. Its accuracy and reliability improve
if the person making the estimate is an expert and the components or activities being com-
pared are actually similar.
Parametric estimation. This is a technique that uses some parameters and statistical relation-
ships among them to make the estimate. For example, if the unit cost is known, say from his-
torical data, the cost of the whole package containing a number of units can be calculated. This
technique can generate quite accurate results depending on the accuracy of the quantity of
resources and other data that goes into the estimation.
Bottom-up estimation. This technique involves estimating the cost of the parts of a compo-
nent and then aggregating the cost of those parts to calculate the cost of the whole
component. This technique can generate accurate results when you can generally make a bet-
ter estimate of a part than the whole, which is usually the case when enough information is
available.
168     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


      STUDY CHECKPOINT 5.1
      An activity cost estimate goes like this: It will take a programmer 20 hours to write this program.
      The average rate to hire a programmer is $50 per hour. Therefore, the cost of writing this pro-
      gram, assuming that everything else needed to write the program (such as a computer) is in
      place, is 20x$50=$1,000. What kind of estimation technique is at work here?



           Contingency reserve analysis. The following two problems are associated with the estimates:
                Estimates are approximations, and approximations imply uncertainty, which means
                risk.
                Some stakeholders will always push the envelope on the project scope, and each
                organization has some tolerance for overrunning the objectives. This will mean more
                cost.
           You will need some funds to deal with both of these situations. What comes to your rescue
           here is called contingency reserve. The contingency reserve, in general, is an amount of resource
           (funds or time) allocated in addition to the calculated estimates to reduce the risk arising from
           various sources--for example, from the overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to
           the performing organization. In other words, the contingency reserves are the funds reserved
           to deal with events that are anticipated but not certain. Contingency reserves can be used at
           the discretion of the project manager. The overall cost estimate should include the contingency
           reserves.


                        CAUTION
                  Contingency reserves may artificially raise the overall cost estimates. So if they are
                  included in the cost estimates, they should be put into a separate category. These
                  contingency reserves are usually not part of the budget included in the cost baseline
                  used to evaluate the project performance.



           Vendor bid analysis. Bids from qualified vendors on parts of the project or even the whole pro-
           ject can help in estimating the project cost.
           Cost of quality. Cost of quality, discussed in the next chapter, should also be considered when
           making cost estimates.
           Three-point estimates. Three-point estimates, discussed in the previous chapter for duration
           estimates, can also be applied in the same way to cost estimates.
                         PLANNING FOR PROJECT RESOURCES                                Chapter 5           169



                  TIP
            Note that the accuracy of cost estimates depends on many other estimates, such as
            activity duration estimates and resource requirement estimates, which go into devel-
            oping the schedule baseline used for making cost estimates. It is important to keep
            this dependency in mind just in case you need to change any of these estimates.



STUDY CHECKPOINT 5.2
 The pessimistic cost estimate for an activity is $6,000, the optimistic estimate is $3,000, and the
 most likely estimate is $5,000. Calculate the expected estimate by using the PERT technique.



     The output of the Estimate Costs process consists of the items discussed in the following
     paragraphs.
     Activity cost estimates. These are the quantitative estimates of various costs required to com-
     plete the project work. Depending on the project and the stage of the project, cost estimates
     may be documented in summary form or in detail. These estimates include costs for all
     resources needed to complete the project work, including equipment, facilities, information
     technology, labor directly applied to the project work, material, and services. Indirect costs and
     special categories, such as allowances and contingency reserves, must also be included.
     Estimate bases. It's important to document what the bases of the cost estimates were. These
     may highly depend on the application area of the project. At a higher level, the following ele-
     ments must be included in the documentation:
           Assumptions made in making the estimates--for example, the labor rate and where
           this data came from.
           Constraints that affected the estimates--for example, a milestone must be met by a
           certain date.
           The methods used to develop the estimate--for example, a three-point estimate.
           The uncertainty, such as 10%, and the confidence level must be assigned to an
           estimate.
     In a nutshell, the outcome of estimating costs will include a cost estimate for each project activ-
     ity and the basis for that estimate, which can be used to determine the project budget.


Determining Project Budget
     Determining the project budget is the process of aggregating the cost estimates for all project
     activities and assigning a timeline to them. Cost aggregation is the technique used to calculate
     the cost of a whole by summing up the costs of the parts of which the whole is made. You can
170   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        use the bottom-up estimation technique to aggregate the costs of all the components and activ-
        ities to calculate the total cost of the project. The timeline assigned to this cost will be impor-
        tant to reconcile the expenditure with the funding limits. The reconciliation may require
        rescheduling some activities.
        The budget is determined by using the Determine Budget process illustrated in Figure 5.6.
        Most of the items in the input to this process are already described in this chapter. Organiza-
        tional process assets may include organizational policies and tools for determining the budget.
        The reserve analysis at budget level includes management reserve in addition to contingency
        reserve, and you must understand the difference between the two. Contingency reserves are
        the funds that can be used to deal with the unplanned events that can potentially transpire in
        case one or more identified risks occur, whereas management reserves are the funds that can
        be used in case of yet unplanned but future changes in some aspects of the project, such as the
        project scope.




            FIGURE 5.6 The Determine Budget process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

        The approved budget that includes the aggregated cost with timeline is called the cost baseline.
        The cost performance of the project is monitored, measured, and controlled against this base-
        line. This is why it's also called the cost performance baseline. Funding requirements for the pro-
        ject are derived from the cost baseline and the reserve analysis.
        Do not leave out the cost of the internal employees of the organization who will work on the
        project. They are not free, for two reasons: The organization pays for them, and they do not
        have infinite numbers of hours to put into the project. Their cost to the project will be deter-
        mined just like any other project role based on the hours of work they will put into the project.
        In the process of determining the budget, you may need to update the project schedule, cost
        estimates, and the risk register.
        Your organization may not have the resources to complete all parts of the project. For those
        parts of the project, you will need to use what is called procurement.
                     PLANNING FOR PROJECT RESOURCES                               Chapter 5       171



              CAUTION
        The standard practice is not to include the reserves in the cost baseline, but they may
        be included in the overall budget of the project. That means the reserves will not be
        used in the calculations of earned value measurements discussed in an upcoming
        chapter.




Procuring the Project Resources
  Procurement refers to obtaining--purchasing or renting--products, services, or results from
  outside the project team to complete the project. Accordingly, procurement management is an
  execution of a set of processes used to obtain (procure) the products, services, or results from
  outside the project team to complete the project. There are two main roles involved in pro-
  curement management:

      Rajinder Preeti is in the process of estimating costs and preparing the budget for her project. In

Planning for Procurement
   Planning procurements includes making and documenting purchasing decisions, identifying
   potential sellers, and developing a procurement approach. Although the procurement planning
   should be done early in the project, like any other planning, it might be necessary at any stage
   of the project as the need arises due to approved changes or other circumstances.
   Procurement is planned by performing the Plan Procurements process illustrated in Figure
   5.8. During procurement planning, you will be looking at lots of information, such as the scope
   baseline, stakeholder requirements, partner agreements, risk registers, activity resource require-
   ments, and cost baseline. All this information will help you identify what needs to be done to
   complete the project, what the risks involved are, and what needs to be procured. Enterprise
   environmental factors, such as market conditions, availability of the product in the market,
   past performance of potential suppliers, and unique local conditions, must be considered as
   input to this process. The organizational process assets that can influence procurement plan-
   ning include procurement policies and procedures of the performing organization, a supplier
   system of already established sellers that the organization currently deals with, and an infor-
   mation system that can be used to develop the procurement management plan. You will also
   need to know how to make make-or-buy decisions and what the different contract types are.




       FIGURE 5.8 The Plan Procurements process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


Make-or-Buy Decisions
   Obviously, procurement refers to buying something as compared to making it in-house. The
   decision to buy or make can be based on one or more of the reasons listed in Table 5.3. Buy
   can mean to purchase or to rent. The decision to purchase or to rent should be based on the
   effective cost in the long term. For example, if it is a piece of hardware that will be used only
   in this project, you do not anticipate its use in any future project, and renting is significantly
   cheaper than buying, you should probably rent it. You might decide to buy it if this hardware
174   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        is of common use in the kind of work your organization does and therefore it will be used in
        other projects as well.

                      NOTE
                An output of the procurement planning process is the statement of work (SOW),
                which is a document summarizing the work to be performed. The SOW can be writ-
                ten by the buyer or the seller to specify what products will be delivered or what ser-
                vices will be performed. It is also called the contract statement of work.


        Before you can buy, you need to get information from the sellers. In other words, you need to
        request seller responses. Make-or-buy analysis is a technique used in the plan purchases and
        acquisitions process. Also in this process, you need to use a technique to determine the type of
        contract you will use for the procurement.


   Determining Contract Types
        A contract is a mutually binding agreement between a buyer and a seller that obligates the seller
        to provide the specified product, service, or result and obligates the buyer to make the payment
        for it. Contracts generally fall into the three categories discussed in this list.
        Fixed-price (lump-sum) contracts. A fixed-price contract, also called a lump-sum contract or
        a firm fixed-price contract, is an agreement that specifies the fixed total price for the product,
        service, or result to be procured. An example of a fixed-price contract is a purchase order for
        the specified item to be delivered by a specified date for a specified price. This category of con-
        tracts is generally used for products and services that are well-defined and have good histori-
        cal information. A fixed-price contract for a poorly defined product or a service with very little
        historical record is a source of high risk for both the seller and the buyer.
                   PLANNING FOR PROJECT RESOURCES                               Chapter 5       175


Cost-reimbursable contracts. A contract in this category includes two kinds of costs:
     Actual cost. This is the payment (reimbursement) to the seller for the actual cost of
     the item, which includes the direct cost and the indirect cost (overhead). An actual
     cost, such as the salary of the project staff working on the item, is incurred directly
     from the work on the item, whereas an indirect cost, such as the cost of utilities and
     equipment for the office of the staff member, is the cost of doing business. Indirect
     cost is generally calculated as a percentage of the actual cost. The actual cost is also
     called the project cost. The project here refers to the project of the seller to produce
     the items for the buyer.
     Fee. This typically represents the seller's profit.
As discussed in the following list, there are three types of cost-reimbursable contracts:
     Cost plus fee (CPF) or cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC). The payment to the
     seller includes the actual cost and the fee, which is a percentage of the actual cost.
     Note that the fee is not fixed; it varies with the actual cost.
     Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF). The payment to the seller includes the actual cost and a
     fixed fee, which can be calculated as a percentage of the estimated project cost. Note
     that the fee is fixed and does not vary with the actual project cost.
     Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF). The payment to the seller includes the actual cost
     and a predetermined incentive bonus based on achieving certain objectives.


             NOTE
      Both fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts can optionally include
      incentives--for example, a bonus from the buyer to the seller if the seller meets cer-
      tain target schedule dates or exceeds some other predetermined expectations.



Because cost overrun can occur in any type of cost-reimbursable contract, and the cost over-
run will be paid by the buyer, this category of contract poses risk to the buyer.
Time and material (T&M) contracts. This type of contract is based on the rates of time and
materials used to produce the procured product. This is a hybrid that contains some aspects
from both the fixed-price category and the cost-reimbursable category. The contracts in this
category resemble the contracts in the cost-reimbursable category because the total cost and
the exact quantity of the items is not fixed at the time of the agreement. The contracts resem-
ble fixed-price contracts because the unit rates can be fixed in the contract. These types of
contracts are useful when you do not know the quantity of the procured items. For example,
you do not know how much time a contract programmer will take to develop a software pro-
gram, so you determine the hourly rate in the contract, but not the total cost for writing the
program. In this category of contracts, the risk is high for the buyer because the buyer agreed
to pay for all the time the seller takes to produce the deliverables.
176     Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


           Table 5.4 lists different types of contracts and the corresponding risk bearers.

            cost (CPPC)                                  increases with the increase in cost, this type poses
                                                         maximum risk to the buyer.

   The major output of procurement planning is the procurement management plan.


Procurement Management Plan
   This document describes how the procurement will be managed throughout the project. The
   plan includes the following:
        How the make-or-buy decisions will be made and handled
        Contracts
         What types of contracts will be used for this project
         The form and format for the statement of work related to a procurement or a
            contract
         Metrics to be used to evaluate potential sellers and to manage contracts
         Requirements for performance bonds or insurance contracts that might be put in
            place to mitigate some project risks
        Management and coordination
         How to manage multiple sellers.
         How to coordinate procurement with other aspects of the project, such as the
            project schedule, scope, budget, and status progress reporting.
         Evaluation criteria for selecting sellers and measuring their performance. It is
            also called source selection criteria and is described in Chapter 7 when we discuss
            conducting procurements.
        A list of assumptions and constraints that could affect the procurement
        Any needed standardized procurement documents
   In a nutshell, the major tasks of procurement planning are making make-or-buy decisions,
   preparing the procurement management plan, preparing the statement of work, determining a
   suitable type of contract, and preparing or acquiring the procurement documents. Once you
   have these elements in place, you are ready to implement the procurement plan, which will be
   discussed further on in the book.


   Exam's Eye View
    Comprehend

     Human resource planning is used to determine the roles that will perform the schedule activities
        and to develop the staff management plan to fill the roles with team members.

     The human resource plan and the project schedule are used to make cost estimates for activities,
        which are aggregated to determine the project budget.
178   Part II          PLANNING THE PROJECT



          The accuracy of cost estimates depends on the accuracy of other estimates, such as activity
                duration estimates and activity resource requirements estimates.

          The major tasks of procurement planning are making make-or-buy decisions, preparing the
                procurement management plan, preparing the statement of work, determining a suitable type
                of contract, and preparing or acquiring the procurement documents.

          Of all the contract types discussed in this chapter, only the firm fixed-price contract can pre-
                sent risk to the seller.

          The contract type that presents the most risk to the buyer is the cost plus percentage of cost
                because the fee (which is a percentage cost) also increases if cost overrun occurs.

         Look Out

          Information about the responsibilities of the human resources will be scattered across different
                parts of the project management plan.

          The approved budget that includes the aggregated cost with timeline is called the cost baseline.
                The cost performance of the project is monitored, measured, and controlled against this base-
                line.

          The standard practice is not to include the reserves in the cost baseline, but they may be
                included in the overall budget of the project. That means the reserves will not be used in the
                calculations of earned value measurements.

          A fixed-price contract is the riskiest contract for the seller.
          The contract type that presents the most risk to the buyer is the cost plus percentage of cost
                contract because the fee (which is a percentage cost) also increases if cost overrun occurs.

         Memorize

          The responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) is a matrix used to specify the relationships
                between schedule activities, roles to perform those activities, and team members assigned to
                the roles.

          The project budget is the time-phased project cost obtained by aggregating the individual
                activity costs.

          Contingency reserves are used for two purposes: to deal with uncertainties in the duration used
                in the schedule and the cost used in the budget and to deal with overruns of the project objec-
                tives to meet the stakeholder expectations.

          Analogous estimation is less time consuming but also less accurate than parametric estimation
                and bottom-up estimation.

Introduction
  Quality and risk are two important interrelated aspects of any project that need to be man-
  aged. While quality refers to the degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables
  and objectives fulfill the project requirements, risk refers to an uncertain event or condition that,
  if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives. After you have
  planned the project scope to the WBS level, as discussed in the previous chapter, you are ready
  to plan the quality and risk management. After the project starts executing, you will not have
  enough time to plan a response to a risk if it occurs, so you need to plan risk responses before
  the project starts executing. To do that, you need to identify the risks and analyze them.
  The core question in this chapter is: How do you plan for quality and risk management? In
  search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: planning quality, identifying and analyzing
  risks, and planning risk responses.



Managing Quality: Big Picture
  Quality refers to the degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables and objec-
  tives fulfills the project requirements. In other words, it is the sum of project and product char-
  acteristics that help fulfill the requirements. The broader goal of quality management is to
  ensure that a given project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. Quality man-
  agement has two components: project quality management and product quality management.
  Whereas product quality management techniques depend upon the specific product that the
  project is going to produce, project quality management applies to all projects independent of
  the nature of the products.
  While dealing with quality, you should be able to distinguish between the terms in the fol-
  lowing pairs:
       Grade and quality. Grade is a category assigned to products with the same overall
       functional use but that differ in their technical characteristics and features, whereas
       quality is the degree to which the inherent characteristics of a product meet the
       requirements. Number of defects is an example of poor quality, whereas a limited
       number of features is an example of low grade.
       Precision and accuracy. Precision is a spread of different measurements of the same
       quantity, constant, or variable, such as gravity or cost. The smaller the spread of
       measured values, the better the precision. Accuracy is a measurement of how close
       the measured values are to the true value of the quantity. The closer the measured
       value is to the actual (or true) value, the better the accuracy of measurements.
        PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                  Chapter 6       185


     Prevention and inspection. Prevention is a direction to perform an activity that will
     keep an error from entering the product and the process. Inspection is a technique to
     examine whether an activity, component, product, result, or service complies with
     planned requirements. So, the goal of inspection is to ensure that errors do not reach
     the customer.


            NOTE
     PMI's approach to quality management is intended to be compatible with that of Inter-
     national Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is compatible with proprietary
     approaches to quality, such as those proposed by Crosby, Deming, Juan, and others.
     It is also compatible with proprietary approaches to quality management, such as
     continuous improvement, cost of quality (COQ), design reviews, failure mode and
     effect analysis (FMEA), Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM), and the voice
     of the customer.



Project management and quality management have come a long way as separate disciplines of
knowledge and practice. It should not come as a surprise that quality management is one of
nine knowledge areas in standard project management. In a complementary way, both modern
quality management and project management recognize the importance of the following crit-
ical issues:
Continuous improvement. Continuous improvement means continuing to improve the qual-
ity through a process of planning for quality, implementing quality, auditing quality, and re-
planning based on lessons learned or auditing. So really, quality improvement is an endless
cycle, called a plan-do-check-act cycle as defined by Shewhart and modified by Deming. Per-
forming organizations can also use techniques such as Six Sigma and TQM to improve the
quality.
Customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction can be a very vague notion that can mean dif-
ferent things to different parties. However, in project management and quality management,
customer satisfaction means planned customer requirements are met. To achieve customer
satisfaction in the real world, you need to understand, define, and evaluate the customer
expectations and also manage those expectations, in addition to meeting the planned require-
ments. Otherwise, you might meet the planned requirements, and the customer may still be
dissatisfied.
Management responsibility. This refers to the responsibility of management to provide
resources needed for the project team to succeed. Although all team members should be respon-
sible for the success of their parts of the project, they cannot succeed without management
responsibility.
186     Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


          Prevention over inspection. One of the fundamental tenets of modern quality management
          is plan, design, and build in quality as opposed to inspect in. The cost of preventing mistakes
          is much less than finding them through inspections and then fixing them. Therefore, cost of
          quality (COQ) is less in prevention than through inspection. The COQ is defined as the total
          cost of quality-related efforts throughout the product lifecycle.


      STUDY CHECKPOINT 6.1
      You are trying out a Monte Carlo simulation program that estimates the value of a parameter by
      using some random variables. You know through the data that the exact value should be 50. You
      ran the program three times, and it gave you three values: 60, 61, and 62. Based on these val-
      ues, answer the following questions:
       A. How precise is the program in making the estimates?
       B. How accurate are the estimates?
       C. Are the values generated by the program more accurate or more precise?



          The performing organization might have its own quality policy and procedures in addition to
          the three quality management processes shown in Figure 6.1 and explained in the following
          list.
                Plan Quality. This process is used to identify which quality requirements and stan-
                dards are relevant to the project at hand and to determine how to meet these
                requirements and standards, as well as how compliance to the quality requirements
                will be demonstrated.
                Perform Quality Assurance. This process is used to audit the fulfillment of quality
                requirements to ensure that the project employs all the planned quality requirements
                and standards.
                Perform Quality Control. This process monitors project results to ensure that they
                meet the agreed-upon quality standards and identifies ways to eliminate the factors
                that keep the project results from meeting standards--that is, to make recommenda-
                tions for changes or actions.
          The processes for quality assurance are used as part of executing the project, and quality con-
          trol is used as part of monitoring and controlling the project. These processes are therefore dis-
          cussed in forthcoming chapters. Quality planning is performed during the project planning
          stage and is discussed next.

Planning Quality
  According to PMBOK, quality is defined as the degree to which a set of characteristics of pro-
  ject deliverables and objectives fulfill the project requirements. Therefore, any characteristic that
  influences the satisfaction of the stakeholders is included in determining the quality. The pro-
  ject quality management processes include performing quality planning, quality assurance, and
  quality control. Quality planning is the quality process that is performed during the planning
  phase to accomplish the following goals.
       Identify which quality standards are relevant to the project at hand
       Determine how to satisfy these standards
  Figure 6.2 depicts the quality planning process.
  The project scope statement is the key input to the quality planning process, in addition to
  other input items discussed next.
188   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT




            FIGURE 6.2 The Plan Quality process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


   Input to Quality Planning
        This section details items that can be used as input to the quality planning process, as shown
        in the following paragraphs:
        Project performance baseline. The project performance baseline constituted by the scope base-
        line, schedule baseline, and cost baseline contains the list of all the deliverables and objectives
        to which the quality needs to be applied. For example, the following components of the pro-
        ject scope statement are especially relevant to quality planning:
             Project deliverables.
             Project objectives.
             Project requirements.
             A product scope description that may contain the details of technical issues and
             other quality-related concerns.
             Product acceptance criteria. The definition of acceptance criteria has an impact on
             the quality cost.
        You find out the accepted schedule performance from the schedule baseline and the accepted
        cost performance from the cost baseline.
        Stakeholder register and risk register. The stakeholder register may help in identifying the
        stakeholders that will have interests in quality. The risk register will help identify positive risks
        (opportunities) and negative risks (threats) that may have impact on quality.
        Enterprise environmental factors. Guidelines, regulations from a government agency, rules,
        and standards relevant to the project at hand are examples of enterprise environmental factors
        that must be considered during quality planning. For example, procedures relevant to the appli-
        cation area of this project should be followed. Working or operating conditions and environ-
        ment can also affect the project quality.
            PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                        Chapter 6       189


   Organizational process assets. The following organizational process assets can affect the pro-
   ject from the perspective of quality planning:
        Information from previous projects and lessons learned
        Quality-related historical database
        An organizational quality policy, which is composed of overall intentions and high-
        level direction of an organization with respect to quality, established by the manage-
        ment at executive level
   If the performing organization lacks a quality policy, the project team will need to develop a
   quality policy for the project. Once a quality policy is in place, it is your responsibility to ensure
   that the project stakeholders are aware of it and are on the same page.
   With the input items in place, you use some tools and techniques to perform quality planning,
   as discussed in the following section.


Tools and Techniques Used for Quality Planning
   The tools and techniques used for quality planning include benchmarking, cost/benefit analy-
   sis, experiment design, and brainstorming.
   Benchmarking. Benchmarking is comparing practices, products, or services of a project with
   those of some reference projects for the purposes of learning, improving, and creating the basis
   for measuring performance. These reference projects might be previous projects performed
   inside or outside of the performing organization. Improvement and performance are of course
   quality-related factors. For example, you might have a similar project performed in the past that
   accepted no more than two defects in each feature. You might use that as a quality criterion--
   a benchmark--for your project.
   Cost of quality and cost/benefit analysis. As mentioned earlier, the cost of quality is the total
   quality-related cost during the lifecycle of the product. That includes the costs incurred in
   implementing conformance to the requirements, reworking due to the defects resulting from
   failure to meet the requirements, and updating the product or service to meet the requirements.
   The cost of performance consists of prevention costs and appraisal costs. Prevention costs
   include the costs of appropriate equipment, documenting and performing processes, time and
   effort to perform the project work the right way, and needed training of the team members.
   The appraisal costs include the costs of inspecting, testing, and loss due to destructive testing.
   Cost of nonconformance includes rework and waste if the product is rejected internally because
   it did not meet the quality standards. If the problems with the product were found by the cus-
   tomer, however, the results could be more much more costly, including liabilities and loss of
   business.
   During quality planning, you must consider the tradeoff between the cost and the benefit of
   quality and strike the appropriate balance for a given project. Implementing quality has its costs,
   including quality management and fulfilling quality requirements. The benefits of meeting
   quality requirements include less rework, resulting in overall higher productivity; lower costs
   of maintaining the product or service; and higher customer satisfaction.
190   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Experiment design. Also called design of experiments (DOE), this is a statistical method that
        can be used to identify the factors that might influence a set of specific variables for a product
        or a process under development or in production. You look for optimal conditions by chang-
        ing the values of a number of variables simultaneously rather than changing one variable at a
        time. By using the results from this technique, you can optimize the products and processes.
        For example, you can use DOE to strike the right balance between cost of quality and its ben-
        efits. During planning, DOE can also be used to determine the types of tests and their impact
        on cost of quality.
        Other quality planning tools. Other tools that you can use in quality planning, depending
        upon the project, include brainstorming, flowcharting, control charts, and statistical sampling.
        Statistical sampling involves randomly selecting a part of the population for study. Control
        charts, flowcharting, and statistical sampling are discussed further on in this book, when we
        discuss quality control. Some other tools of quality planning are included in the following list:
             Affinity diagrams. A business tool used to organize a large set of data and ideas into
             logical groups based on the relationships among these ideas.
             Force field analysis. A technique to understand the forces (factors) influencing a sit-
             uation. It can be used to separate the forces that drive movement toward a goal from
             those that either block that movement or drive it away from the goal.
             Matrix diagrams. This method is used to explore the relationships between different
             entities, such as objectives and causes, by displaying these entities in a matrix, with
             cells of the matrix representing the relationships.
             Nominal group techniques. These are the decision-making methods that are used
             among groups of different sizes with two goals in mind: Make the decision quickly
             and take everyone's opinion into account. One example involves decision making by
             a group of one size, then a review of all those ideas from brainstorming by a group
             of another size, and then making the final decision by a group of yet another size.
             Prioritization matrices. This is the method of prioritizing entities, such as prob-
             lems, ideas, and issues, by using some ranking criteria.


                       NOTE
                Part of the cost of quality is failure cost, which is the cost of rework due to failure to
                meet the requirements during product development. Failure cost, also called cost of
                poor quality, is grouped into two categories: external failure cost, which is the cost of
                fixing problems found by the customer, and internal failure cost, which is the cost of
                fixing problems found within the project.


        You can use one or more of these techniques to generate the output of quality planning.
           PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                      Chapter 6       191


Output of Quality Planning
   A major output of the quality planning process is the quality management plan. This section
   discusses the quality management plan and other output items.
   Quality management plan. The quality management plan describes how the quality policy for
   this project will be implemented by the project management team. It includes approaches to
   quality assurance, quality control, and continuous process improvement. The quality manage-
   ment plan also contains the quality baseline that sets the criteria that specify the quality objec-
   tives for the project and thereby makes the basis for measuring and reporting quality
   performance. For example, a project that is finished on time, with everything delivered in scope,
   and that stayed within its cost is a project with high quality performance.
   This plan becomes a component of the overall project management plan.



                TIP
         Whether the quality management plan is informal and high level or formal and
         detailed depends upon the size, complexity, and needs of the project.



   Quality metrics. This is an operational criterion that defines in specific terms what something
   (such as a characteristic or a feature) is and how the quality control process measures it. For
   example, it is not specific enough to say the defects in the product will be minimized. Rather,
   specifying something such as that no feature will have more than two defects is a measurable
   criterion and hence a metric. Some examples of quality metrics are cost performance, schedule
   performance, defect frequency, failure rate, and test coverage. The metrics that you set during
   quality planning will be used in quality assurance and quality control.
   Quality checklist. A checklist is a structured tool used to verify that a predetermined set of
   required steps has been performed. The checklists can come in imperative form ("to do" lists)
   or in interrogative form ("have you done this" lists). Checklists are prepared (or identified if
   they already exist in the organization) in quality planning and used in quality control.
   Process improvement plan. This plan describes how to improve some of the processes that will
   be used in the project. For example, one purpose of improvement is to prevent activities in the
   processes that are not needed for this project. This is accomplished by describing the purpose,
   start, and end of a given process, the input to the process, and the output of the process. This
   is equivalent to drawing boundaries around the process. The process improvement plan may
   also include some metrics used to measure the efficiency of the process.
   Updates to project documents. During quality planning, you may end up making changes
   that will require modifying corresponding documents, such as the stakeholder register and
   responsibility assignment matrix (RAM).
192   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Note that quality planning might influence other planning processes. For example, imple-
        menting the identified quality standards will impact the cost and the schedule. Furthermore,
        the implementation of a quality characteristic might require a risk analysis of the problem that
        the quality characteristic addresses.



   Managing Risks: The Big Picture
        To most of us, risk means danger--if it happens, it will result in negative, undesired conse-
        quences. However, according to PMI, risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,
        has a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives related to components such
        as schedule (time), cost, scope, or quality. For example, one of the obvious schedule objectives
        for a project is to complete the project by the scheduled deadline. If a risk related to the sched-
        ule occurs, it can delay the completion of the project, or it can make it possible to finish the
        project earlier. So, the two characteristics of a risk in project management are the following:
             It stems from elements of uncertainty.
             It might have negative or positive effects on meeting the project objectives.
        Risk management includes planning risk management, identifying and analyzing the risks,
        preparing the response plan, monitoring the risk, and implementing the risk response if the risk
        occurs. Figure 6.3 shows the corresponding processes used to accomplish these tasks, which
        are also explained in the following list:
             Plan Risk Management. A process to determine the how of risk management: how
             to conduct risk management for the project at hand.
             Identify Risks. A process to identify and document the risks that might occur for a
             given project.
             Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis. A process used to estimate the overall probabil-
             ity for risks to occur and their impact and to prioritize them accordingly for further
             analysis.
             Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. A process used to analyze numerically the
             effect of identified risks on meeting the project objectives.
             Plan Risk Responses. A process used to prepare a risk response plan in order to
             increase the positive impact and decrease the negative impact of risks on the project.
             Monitor and Control Risks. A process used for tracking identified risks, identifying
             new risks, executing risk response plans, and evaluating the effectiveness of executing
             responses throughout the lifecycle of the project.
        The risk monitoring and control process is part of the control process group; therefore, we will
        discuss this process in Chapter 11, "Monitoring and Controlling Quality and Risk." The other
        five processes are discussed in the following sections, starting with risk management planning.

FIGURE 6.3 Processes used in risk management.




                   TIP
             The data flow between the different processes shown in Figure 6.3 is true in general.
             However, note that depending upon the project and the experience of the risk man-
             agement team, shortcuts can be taken. For example, you can go directly from risk
             identification to quantitative risk analysis, or even to risk response planning.




Planning Risk Management
      Risk management planning is the process used to decide how the risk management activities
      for the project at hand will be performed. The major goals for planning risk management are
      threefold: Ensure that the type, level, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to
      the actual risk involved in the project and the importance of the project to the organization;
      secure sufficient resources, including time for risk management activities; and set up an agreed-
      upon basis for evaluating risks. To be specific, you use the risk management planning process
      to determine the following:
            How to approach the risk management activities for this project
            How to plan the risk management activities
            How to execute the risk management activities
      Figure 6.4 illustrates the Plan Risk Management process used for planning risk management.
194   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT




            FIGURE 6.4 The Plan Risk Management process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

        The first document to look for risks is the project scope statement, and it is therefore an input
        to risk management planning.


   Developing the Risk Management Plan
        You perform risk management planning to develop a document called the risk management plan.
        As an input to this development process, you need to look at the project scope statement, which
        contains elements such as the following, which are relevant to risk management planning:
             Assumptions and constraints. Assumptions should be evaluated for their uncer-
             tainty and thereby the possible risks. Constraints represent fixed parameters, such as
             available funds and deadlines that can also pose risks to the project.
             Project objectives and requirements. You must address the risks that might prevent
             the team from meeting the project objectives and requirements.
             Product description. There might be risks involved in performing the work for
             meeting the product description.
             Initial risk identification. The project scope statement might contain some of the
             risks you initially identified. Now you have more information to build on that work.
        The cost management plan may have information on risks related to budget, contingency, and
        management reserves. The schedule management plan may have information on how the
        schedule contingencies will be used and reported. The communication management plan
        should have information on who should receive reports about the different risks.
        The enterprise environmental factors relevant to risk planning include the organizational atti-
        tude toward risks and the risk tolerance level of the organization. This information can be found
        from the policy statements of the organization and from actual experience with previous pro-
        jects. The organizational process assets relevant to risk planning include organizational
        approaches toward risk management, definitions of concepts and terms used within the orga-
        nization, standard risk templates you can use, a roles and responsibilities list, and authority lev-
        els for decision making.
           PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                  Chapter 6        195


   You develop the risk management plan by holding planning meetings, which might include the
   following attendees:
           Project manager
           Selected members from the project team
           Selected stakeholders
           Any member from the performing organization who has responsibility for risk plan-
           ning and executing
   In these meetings, the input items are used to develop the risk management plan, the only out-
   put of the risk management planning process.


Risk Management Plan
   The only output of the Plan Risk Management process is the risk management plan, which
   includes the following elements.
   Methodology. This specifies the system of approaches, tools, and data sources that will be
   used to perform risk management on the project at hand. These tools and approaches might
   vary over projects, so you have to make the best selection for the given project.
   Identifying and assigning resources. This identifies and assigns resources for risk manage-
   ment, such as human resources, cost, and time.
        Roles and responsibilities. This specifies the roles and responsibilities for each role
        involved in risk management. These roles are assigned to members of the risk man-
        agement team. The risk management team might include members from outside the
        project team.
        Budgeting. The cost for risk management activities needs to be estimated and
        included in the budget and the project cost baseline.
        Timing and scheduling. The plan specifies how often risk management processes
        will be performed and which risk management activities will be included in the pro-
        ject schedule, which is planned and developed by using processes discussed in Chap-
        ter 4, "Planning for Project Schedule and Communication."



               TIP
        It's a good idea for the risk management team to include members from outside the
        project team to ensure unbiased risk evaluations.
196   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Risk categories. This element specifies how the risks will be categorized. The risk categories
        typically correspond to the sources of risks. Depending upon the size and complexity of the
        project, you might need to develop a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical
        structure that breaks the identified risk categories into subcategories. In developing this struc-
        ture, you will end up identifying various areas and causes of potential risks. The performing
        organization might already have prepared a categorization of typical risks. However, you need
        to examine this categorization for each project and tailor it according to the needs of the pro-
        ject at hand. The risk categorization helps you identify risks to the extent that you will be
        identifying various areas and causes of potential risks for your project.



                      TIP
                Some project management literature and some PMP exam questions might use the
                terms risk sources and risk categories synonymously.



        Risk probability and impact. Defining different levels of risk probabilities and impacts is nec-
        essary to ensure the quality and credibility of the qualitative risk analysis that we will discuss
        later in this chapter. The basic issues are defining the scale of likelihood that the risk will hap-
        pen and defining the scale of the strength of its impact if the risk occurs. These definitions,
        even if they already exist in the organization, must be examined and tailored to the needs of
        the specific project.
        You can define the risk probability scale from very unlikely to almost certainly, called the rel-
        ative scale. As an alternative, you can define a numerical scale in which the probability is rep-
        resented by numbers, in which a value close to 0.0 means very unlikely and a value close to 1.0
        means almost certainly. The impact scale represents the size of the risk impact on the given
        project objective should the risk occur. Just like the probability scale, you can define the impact
        scale relatively or numerically. The relative scale can range from very low impact to very high
        impact, with points in the middle such as low, moderate, and high. As an alternative, you can
        define the impact numerically; it might be linear, such as the first point at 0.1, the second
        point at 0.2, and the tenth point at 1.0, or it might be nonlinear, such as the first point at
        0.001, the second point at 0.01, and the third point at 0.1. Figure 6.5 shows an example of lin-
        ear and nonlinear impact scales, in which the impact scale for Objective 1 is nonlinear and the
        impact scale for Objective 2 is linear. You can think of the X axis as a variable on which the
        risk impact depends.
        Risks are prioritized according to the size of their impact on the project objectives, which can
        be recorded in what is called an impact matrix or lookup table. Even if your organization already
        has a typical impact matrix, you should examine it and tailor it to the needs of the specific
        project at hand. I will discuss the probability and impact matrix in more detail later in this
        chapter.

    FIGURE 6.5 An example of a linear and a nonlinear impact scale. The impact scale for Objective
                  1 is nonlinear, whereas the scale for Objective 2 is linear.

As an example, Table 6.1 shows the risk impact definitions for four project objectives: cost,
quality, scope, and time. Note that this example only shows the negative impact. The first row
of the table presents the impact scale, and each cell in the following rows from Column 2 to
Column 6 specifies the impact on a specific objective corresponding to a point on the overall
impact scale. For example, the cell corresponding to the second row and fifth column reads
that high impact (0.65) means a 50 to 80% increase in cost.

        Risk reporting and tracking. This element describes the format of risk reports, such as the
        risk register, a document that contains the results of risk analysis and risk response planning.
        Furthermore, it describes how different aspects of risk activities will be recorded so that the
        risks can be monitored for the current project. Also, should the performing organization
        decide to audit the risk management process, one should be able to track these activities.
        Another reason for recording these activities could be to save the information for the benefit
        of future projects in the form of lessons learned.
        During the process of planning risk management for a specific project, you revisit the toler-
        ance levels of the stakeholders for certain risks, and these levels may be revised. Risk manage-
        ment planning is the process that generates the risk management plan document, which
        contains the information that will be used in risk identification, risk analysis, and risk response
        planning.
        You cannot manage a risk if it's not identified.



   Identifying Risks
        Risks are identified by using the risk identification process. An unidentified risk is a danger
        lurking out of your sight and waiting to attack the project. The significance of the risk identi-
        fication process cannot be overemphasized. You use the risk identification process to accom-
        plish the following tasks:
             Identify which risks might affect the project at hand
             Document the characteristics of the identified risks in a document called the risk
             register
        Figure 6.6 shows the input, tools and techniques, and the output for the risk identification
        process.
        Note that the risk identification process has the risk management plan as an input item, in
        addition to all the input items that the quality planning and risk management planning
        processes have.


   Input to Risk Identification
        The risk management plan and the project scope baseline are obvious inputs to identifying risks.
        As in many other processes, the enterprise environmental factors and organizational process
        assets relevant to the project at hand must also be considered. These and other input items are
        discussed in the following paragraphs.
        Project scope baseline. Assumptions in the project scope statement, an element of the scope
        baseline, are potential sources of uncertainty, hence the risk. Constraints pose a risk by pre-
        senting predetermined factors, such as hard deadlines and fixed costs, thereby posing questions
        such as, "What is the probability that we can meet this constraint with the available resources?"

    FIGURE 6.6 The Identify Risks process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

The WBS, another component of the scope baseline, can be used to recognize risks at differ-
ent levels of the WBS hierarchy.
Management plans. In the process of identifying risks, you need to look at the cost manage-
ment plan, schedule management plan, risk management plan, and quality management plan.
The approach that any of these plans takes may pose some risks of its own or may enhance
some other risks. The key items from the risk management plan useful for risk identification
are risk categories, roles and responsibilities, and the budget and timing available for the risk
management activities.
Cost and duration estimates. Estimates such as activity cost estimates and activity duration
estimates by definition have a degree of uncertainty built into them. They should be looked at
to identify the potential risks hiding behind this uncertainty.
Stakeholder register. If you look at the stakeholder register, you might find some stakehold-
ers who can give useful input to identifying risks.
Enterprise environmental factors. The environmental factors internal or external to the per-
forming organization that can influence the project must be considered in the risk identifica-
tion process. This might include academic and industry studies, published information,
benchmarking, and commercial databases.
Organizational process assets. This might include information from previous projects (the
knowledge base), including lessons learned, process controls, and risk-related templates.
With this handful of input for your use, you are ready to use a number of tools and techniques
available for risk identification.
200   Part II        PLANNING THE PROJECT


   Tools and Techniques for Risk Identification
        Risk identification is crucial to risk management: If you fail to identify a risk, you will not be
        able to manage it. There are a multitude of tools and techniques available to aid you in iden-
        tifying risks.
        Assumptions analysis. Assumptions in the project scope statement represent uncertainty. You
        analyze these assumptions to identify the risks. Assumptions analysis is the technique used to
        examine the validity of the assumptions and thereby to identify the risks resulting from the
        inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or incompleteness of each assumption. For example, suppose there
        is only one person in the organization who has a rare skill needed for the project. An obvious
        assumption would be that the person will not quit the organization before completing the
        assignment. The inaccuracy of this assumption amounts to the risk.
        Checklist analysis. The carefully prepared checklists in any process are great no-brainer time-
        savers. Projects in the same organization will more often than not have similarities. As a result,
        you can develop a risk identification checklist based on the information gathered from a sim-
        ilar set of projects previously performed. Also, if you developed the risk breakdown structure
        (RBS) in risk planning, the lowest level of the RBS can be used as a checklist.


                      NOTE
                Risk identification checklists are rarely exhaustive. Always explore what is left out of
                the checklist you are using. Also, improve the checklist when you close the project to
                enhance its value for future projects.



        Diagramming techniques. These techniques use diagrams to identify risks by exposing and
        exploring the risks' causes. Here are a few examples:
             Cause-and-effect diagram. A cause-and-effect diagram illustrates how various fac-
             tors (causes) can be linked to potential problems (effects).
             Flowchart diagram. A flowchart depicts how the elements of a system are related to
             each other and shows the logical flow of a process. By examining the flowchart of a
             process, the risk management team can identify points of potential problems in the
             flowchart diagram.
             Influence diagram. An influence diagram is a graphical representation of situations
             that shows relationships among various variables and outcomes, such as causal influ-
             ences and time-ordering of events. By examining these diagrams, the risk manage-
             ment team can recognize potential problem areas and thereby identify risks.
        Documentation reviews. A structured review of the relevant parts of input documents, such
        as the project scope statement and the project management plan, will certainly help in identi-
        fying risks. Furthermore, the knowledge base related to risk management from previous pro-
        jects can also be reviewed.
        PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                   Chapter 6         201


Information-gathering techniques. To identify risks, you need to gather risk-related informa-
tion. Following are some of the information-gathering techniques used in risk identification:
     Brainstorming. The goal here is to get a comprehensive list of potential risks so that
     no risk goes unidentified. The project team, along with relevant experts from differ-
     ent disciplines, can participate in the brainstorming session. Brainstorming is better
     performed under the guidance of a facilitator. You can use the categories of risks or
     the RBS as a framework to keep the session focused on the issue.
     Delphi technique. The goal here is for experts to reach a consensus without biases
     toward each other. I'm sure you will have no problem recalling a time when a decision
     was made because somebody (usually higher in the management hierarchy) said so.
     Contrary to this, the Delphi technique is used to ensure that it is the quality of the
     information and the argument that are important, not who is saying them. A facilita-
     tor circulates a questionnaire among the experts to solicit ideas about the risks of the
     given project. The experts respond anonymously. The responses are compiled and cir-
     culated among the participating experts for further evaluation without attaching a
     name to a response. It might take a few iterations before a general consensus is reached.
     Interviewing. This is one of the common methods used for information gathering
     for risk identification. You interview the appropriate stakeholders and subject-matter
     experts to gather information that will help identify risks for the project at hand.
     Root cause identification. A powerful way to identify risk is to look for anything in
     the project that might generate a risk. In other words, if you can spot a potential
     cause for risks, it's simple to identify the risks resulting from that cause. Further-
     more, if you know the cause of a risk, it helps to plan an effective response. You can
     also look for risks at the opposite side of causes--that is, impacts.
     SWOT analysis. While root cause identification techniques look into the causes of
     risks to identify risks, a SWOT analysis looks at the potential impacts of risks to
     identify risks. If you examine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
     (SWOT) of a given project, you will be exposing the risks involved. Remember that
     a strength is an opportunity, a weakness is a threat, and opportunities and threats
     are posed by risks. This helps broaden the spectrum of risks considered. For exam-
     ple, a strength of your project might be that most of its parts are well understood
     from previously executed similar projects. Therefore, the risks involved in those
     parts will be easy to identify. A weakness of your project might be that one of the
     parts involves new technology that is not well-tested. So, this is a source of
     unknown risks. An opportunity might be that your organization will be the first one
     to take this product to market. An example of a threat might be that the govern-
     ment is considering a bill that, if it becomes a law, will have profound implications
     for your project.
Of course, you can always use the judgment of experts on the topic. You will generally be using
more than one of these tools and techniques to identify risks. During risk identification, you
might discover the causes of the risks, and you might even think of some potential risk
responses. All this is part of the output of the risk identification process.
202   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


   The Risk Register: The Output of Risk Identification
        The risk register is a document that contains the output of the risk identification process. You
        will see later in this chapter that the risk register, which is initiated in the risk identification
        process, will also contain information from other risk management processes. To begin, you
        store the following information from the risk identification process in the risk register:
             List of identified risks. These are the risks that you identified in the risk identifica-
             tion process. These risks should be described in reasonable detail, which may include
             the following:
              The risks. The definition and nature of each risk and the causes that will give
                 rise to the risk.
              List of the root causes of the risks. This is a list of events or conditions that
                 might give rise to the identified risks.
              Updates to risk categories. Risks categories were originally identified in the risk
                 management planning process. However, in the process of identifying risks, you
                 might discover new categories or modify existing categories. The updated risk
                 categories must be included in the risk register.
             List of potential responses. Risk response planning is a separate process that is per-
             formed after risk analysis. However, during risk identification, you might identify
             potential risk responses that you must document in the risk register. These responses
             can be further examined and planned in the risk response planning process.
        The results of the risk identification process usually lead to qualitative risk analysis. However,
        depending upon the project and the experience of the risk management team, risk identifica-
        tion might lead directly to quantitative risk analysis and even to risk response planning.



   Analyzing Risks
        Once the risks have been identified, you need to answer two main questions for each identi-
        fied risk: What are the odds that the risk will occur, and, if it does, what will its impact be on
        the project objectives? You get the answers by performing risk analysis, which comes in two
        forms: qualitative and quantitative.
             Qualitative risk analysis. This is used to prioritize risks by estimating the probabil-
             ity of their occurrence and their impact on the project.
             Quantitative risk analysis. This is used to perform numerical analysis to estimate
             the effect of each identified risk on the overall project objectives and deliverables.
        Usually, you prioritize risks by performing qualitative analysis on them before you perform
        quantitative analysis.

Performing Qualitative Analysis
   Because qualitative analysis is an estimate, it is less precise than quantitative analysis, which is
   based on numbers and hence is more precise. However, qualitative analysis is quick and cheaper.
   It gives you some feel about the risks, and then you can determine which risks needs to be ana-
   lyzed further by using quantitative analysis.
   Figure 6.7 shows the input, tools and techniques, and output for the qualitative analysis, which
   are discussed in the following section.

   Input to Qualitative Risk Analysis
   In addition to the risk register, qualitative risk analysis can also use the risk management plan,
   the project scope statement, and the organizational process assets as input items.
   Project scope statement. When you are performing qualitative risk analysis, you want to
   know what kinds of risks you are dealing with. For example, are you already familiar with these
   risks? If your project is similar to previous projects, it might have well-understood risks. If it is
   a new and complex project, it might involve risks that are not well understood in your organi-
   zation. So, how do you know what kind of project you are dealing with? Simple--you take a
   look at the project scope statement and search for uncertainties.
   Risk management plan. To generate the output of qualitative risk analysis, you will need the
   following elements of the risk management plan:
           Roles and responsibilities for performing risk management
           Budgeting
           Definitions of probabilities and impacts
           The probability and impact matrices
           Risk categories
           Risk timing and scheduling
           Stakeholders' risk tolerances
204   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


        If any of these input items was not developed during risk management planning, it can be
        developed during qualitative analysis.
        Risk register. The risk register contains the list of identified risks that will be the key input to
        the qualitative risk analysis. Updated risk categories and causes of risks can also be useful ele-
        ments of the risk register, which can be used in the qualitative risk analysis.
        Organizational process assets. While analyzing risks, you will make use of the risk-related
        components of the knowledge base from previous projects, such as data about risks and lessons
        learned. You can also look into risk databases that may be available from industry organiza-
        tions and proprietary sources.


        Tools and Techniques for Qualitative Risk Analysis
        Prioritizing risks based on their probability of occurrence and their impact if they do occur is
        the central goal of qualitative risk analysis. Accordingly, most of the tools and techniques used
        involve estimating probability and impact.
        Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability refers to the likelihood that a risk
        will occur, and impact refers to the effect the risk will have on a project objective if it occurs.
        The probability for each risk and the impact of each risk on project objectives, such as cost,
        quality, scope, and time, must be assessed. Note that probability and impact are assessed for
        each identified risk.
        Methods used in making the probability and impact assessment include holding meetings,
        interviewing, considering expert judgment, and using an information base from previous pro-
        jects. A risk with a high probability might have a very low impact, and a risk with a low prob-
        ability might have a very high impact. To prioritize the risks, you need to look at both
        probability and impact.
        Assessment of the risk data quality. Qualitative risk analysis is performed to analyze the risk
        data to prioritize risks. However, before you do it, you must examine the risk data for its qual-
        ity, which is crucial because the credibility of the results of qualitative risk analysis depend upon
        the quality of the risk data. If the quality of the risk data is found to be unacceptable, you
        might decide to gather better-quality data. The technique to assess the risk data quality involves
        examining the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data and also examining how good that
        data is relevant to the specific risk and project for which it is being used.
        Risk urgency assessment. This is a risk prioritization technique based on time urgency. For
        example, a risk that is going to occur now is more urgent to address than a risk that might occur
        a month from now.
        Probability and impact matrix. Risks need to be prioritized for quantitative analysis, response
        planning, or both. The prioritization can be performed by using a probability and impact
        matrix--a lookup table that can be used to rate a risk based on where it falls both on the prob-
        ability scale and on the impact scale. Table 6.2 presents an example of a probability and impact
        matrix by showing both the probability scale and the impact scale. Here is an example of how
         PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                      Chapter 6         205


to read this matrix: Risk R35 has a probability of 0.70 (that is, seven out of 10 chances) for
occurrence and an impact of 0.45 on the project objective for which this matrix is prepared.
How to calculate the numerical scales for the probability and impact matrix and what they
mean depends upon the project and the organization. However, remember the relative mean-
ing: Higher value of a risk on the probability scale means greater likelihood of risk occurrence,
and higher value on the impact scale means greater effect on the project objectives. The higher
the value for a risk, the higher its priority is. For example, Risk R38 has higher priority than
Risk R27.

 Rij, where i and j are integers, represents risks in the two-dimensional (probability and impact)
 space.
Each risk is rated (prioritized) according to the probability and the impact value assigned to it
separately for each objective. Generally, you can divide the matrix in Table 6.2 into three areas--
high-priority risks represented by higher numbers, such as R59, medium-priority risks repre-
sented by moderate numbers, such as R23, and low-priority risks represented by lower numbers,
such as R12. However, each organization has to design its own risk score and risk threshold to
guide the risk response plan.
Note that impact can be a threat (a negative effect) or an opportunity (a positive effect). You
will have separate matrices for threats and opportunities. Threats in the high-priority area
might require priority actions and aggressive responses. Also, you will want to capitalize on
those opportunities in the high-priority area, which you can do with relatively little effort. Risks
posing threats in the low-priority area might not need any response, but they must be kept on
the watch list.
Risk categorization. You defined the risk categories during the risk management planning and
risk identification processes. Now you can assign the identified risks to those categories. You
can also revisit the categorization scheme, such as RBS, that you developed for your project,
because now you have more information about risks for the project. Categorizing risks by their
causes often helps you develop effective risk responses.
206   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Expert judgment. You may need expert judgment to assess the probability and impact of each
        risk. To find an expert, look for people who've had experience with similar projects in the not
        too distant past. While weighing the expert judgment, look for possible biases. Often experts
        are biased toward their area.
        You need to update the risk register with the output of the qualitative risk analysis.


        Output of the Qualitative Risk Analysis:
        Updated Risk Register
        The risk register was initiated during the Identify Risks process and is updated with the results
        from the qualitative risk analysis. The updates include the following:
             Risks categorizations. This means arranging risks in different categories. This helps
             you identify the common root causes of the risks and the areas of the project that
             might require special attention. Furthermore, categorizing risks can bring order to a
             chaotic situation and makes the management of these risks easier and more effective.
             Prioritized list of risks. The risk register has lists of risks prioritized according to
             the probability and impact matrix discussed earlier in this chapter. A separate list can
             be created for each project objective, such as cost, quality, scope, and time. These
             lists help you prioritize efforts for preparing and executing risk responses. The risks
             may be ranked as high, medium, or low.
             Lists of risks. Using some criteria, you can make different lists of risks for effective
             management. Following are some examples:
              List of risks with time urgency. This list includes urgent risks that require atten-
                  tion now or will in the near future.
              Watch list of low-priority risks. This list contains risks that are deemed unim-
                  portant by the qualitative risk analysis but that need to be monitored continually.
              List of risks for additional analysis and response. This list includes risks that
                  need further analysis, such as quantitative analysis or a response action.
             Trends in the analysis results. By examining the results from the qualitative risk
             analysis, you might recognize a trend for specific risks. That trend might suggest fur-
             ther analysis or a specific risk response.
        The main output of qualitative risk analysis is the prioritization of risks based on a probabil-
        ity and impact matrix for each objective. So each objective can have its own prioritized list of
        risks.
        Qualitative risk analysis is a relatively quick and cost-effective way to prioritize risks for risk
        planning. It also lays the groundwork for the quantitative risk analysis if one is required for
        some risks.

Performing Quantitative Analysis
   Quantitative risk analysis is generally performed on risks that have been prioritized by using
   the qualitative risk analysis. However, depending upon the experience of the team and their
   familiarity with the risk, it is possible to skip the qualitative risk analysis and, after the risk iden-
   tification, move directly to the quantitative risk analysis. The quantitative risk analysis has three
   major goals:
         Assess the probabilities of achieving specific project objectives
         Quantify the effect of the risks on the overall project objectives
         Prioritize risks by their contributions to the overall project risk
   Figure 6.8 illustrates the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process in terms of input, tools
   and techniques, and output.




        FIGURE 6.8 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process: input, tools and techniques, and
                       output.


   Input to Quantitative Analysis
   All the items that are input for the qualitative risk analysis are also input for the quantitative
   risk analysis. Because the quantitative risk analysis generally requires more information, it also
   includes project management plans in its list of input items, which are discussed in the fol-
   lowing list.
         Risk register. The key input items from the risk register are the following:
          List of identified risks
          Priority list of risks if the qualitative risk analysis was performed
          Risks with categories assigned to them
208   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


             Management plan. To perform quantitative risk analysis, you must look at the risk
             management plan, cost management plan, and schedule management plan. To gen-
             erate the output of the quantitative risk analysis, you need the following elements of
             the risk management plan:
              Budgeting
              Definitions of probabilities and impacts
              Probability and impact matrix
              Risk categories
              Risk timing and scheduling
             To analyze the effect of risks on the project objectives, you need to know the project
             schedule and the project cost. These can be found in the cost management plan and
             schedule management plan. Also, the approaches taken by these plans can affect
             quantitative risk analysis.
             Organization process assets. The following organizational process assets might be
             useful in the quantitative analysis:
              Information on previously performed similar projects
              Studies performed by risk specialists on similar projects
              Proprietary risk databases or risk databases available from the industry
        Obviously, the quantitative risk analysis will use techniques that are of a more numerical nature.


        Tools and Techniques for Quantitative Analysis
        The quantitative risk analysis can be looked upon as a two-step process--gathering and rep-
        resenting the data, and analyzing and modeling the data. Accordingly, all the techniques fall
        into two categories: data gathering and representation techniques, such as interviewing, prob-
        ability distributions, and expert judgment; and analysis and modeling techniques, such as sen-
        sitivity analysis, EMV analysis, decision tree analysis, and modeling and simulation.
        Interviewing. This technique is used to collect the data for assessing the probabilities of achiev-
        ing specific project objectives. You are looking for results such as: We have a 70% probability
        of finishing the project within the schedule desired by the customer. Or perhaps: We have a
        60% probability of finishing the project within the budget of $100,000. The goal is to deter-
        mine the scale of probabilities for a given objective; for example, there is a 20% probability that
        the project will cost $50,000, a 60% probability that it will cost $100,000, and a 20% proba-
        bility that it will cost $150,000.
        The data is collected by interviewing relevant stakeholders and subject-matter experts. Most
        commonly, you will be exploring the optimistic (best case), pessimistic (worst case), and most
        likely scenarios for a given objective. For example, for the project cost, the optimistic estimate
        might be $10 million, the pessimistic estimate might be $50 million, and the most likely esti-
        mate might be $25 million.

Probability distributions. After you have collected the data on meeting the project objectives,
you can present it in a probability distribution for each objective under study. Note that a dis-
tribution represents uncertainty, and uncertainty represents risk. For example, if you know for
sure the project will cost $25 million, there will be no distribution because it is only one data
point. Distribution comes into the picture when you have several possible values with a prob-
ability assigned to each value. There are distributions of different shapes in which the data can
be presented. Figure 6.9 shows some of them, such as for the cost objective. The X axis repre-
sents the cost, and the Y axis represents the corresponding probability that the project will be
completed within that cost.




    FIGURE 6.9 Examples of probability distributions commonly used in quantitative risk analysis.

The beta distribution and the triangular distribution are the most frequently used distributions.
The other commonly used distributions that could be suitable under given circumstances are
normal distribution and uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is used when all the
values of an objective have the same chance of being true.
Sensitivity analysis. This is a technique used to determine which risk has the greatest impact
on the project. You study the impact of one uncertain element on a project objective by keep-
ing all other uncertain elements fixed at their baseline values. You can repeat this analysis for
several objectives, one at a time. You can also repeat this study for several uncertain elements
(creating risks), one element at a time. This way, you can see the impact of each element (or
risk) on the overall project separate from other elements (or risks).
210   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Expected monetary value analysis. The expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is used to
        calculate the expected value of an outcome when different possible scenarios exist for different
        values of the outcome with some probabilities assigned to them. The goal here is to calculate
        the expected final result of a probabilistic situation. EMV is calculated by multiplying the
        value of each possible outcome by the probability of its occurrence and adding the results. For
        example, if there is 60% probability that an opportunity will earn you $1,000 and a 40% prob-
        ability that it will only earn you $500, the EMV is calculated as follows:
                EMV=0.60x1000+0.40x500=600+200=800
        So the EMV in this case is $800. When you are using opportunities and threats in the same
        calculation, you should express EMV for an opportunity as a positive value and EMV for a
        threat as a negative value. For example, if there is a 60% chance that you will benefit from a
        risk by $1,000 and a 40% probability that you will lose $500 as a result of this risk, the EMV
        is calculated as follows:
                EMV=0.60x1000-0.40x500=600-200=400
        Therefore, the EMV in this case is $400.
        The concept of EMV can be presented in a decision-making technique, such as a decision tree
        analysis.
        Decision tree analysis. This technique uses the decision tree diagram to choose from differ-
        ent available options; each option is represented by a branch of the tree. This technique is used
        when there are multiple possible outcomes with different threats or opportunities with certain
        probabilities assigned to them. EMV analysis is done along each branch, which helps to make
        a decision about which option to choose.
        Figure 6.10 presents a very simple decision tree diagram that depicts two options: updating an
        existing product or building a new product from scratch. The initial cost for the update option
        is $50,000, whereas the initial cost for the build-from-scratch option is $70,000. However, the
        probability for failure is 40% for the update option, compared to 10% for the build-from-scratch
        option, and the impact from failure in both cases is a loss of $200,000. As Study Checkpoint
        6.2 shows, even though the initial cost for the update option is less than the initial cost for the
        build-from-scratch option, the decision will be made in favor of the build-from-scratch option
        because when you combine the initial cost with the EMV resulting from the probability of
        failure, the build-from-scratch option turns out to be a better deal.

    Modeling and simulation. A model is a set of rules to describe how something works; it takes
    input and makes predictions as output. The rules might include formulas and functions based
    on facts, assumptions, or both. A simulation is any analytical method used to imitate a real-life
    system. Simulations in risk analysis are created using the Monte Carlo technique, which is
    named after the city of Monte Carlo--known for its casinos that present games of chance based
212   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT


        on random behavior. Monte Carlo simulation models take random input iteratively to gener-
        ate output for certain quantities as predictions. This technique is used in several disciplines,
        such as physics and biology, in addition to project management. In risk analysis, the input is
        taken randomly from a probability distribution, and the output for impact on the project
        objectives is predicted. The name "Monte Carlo" refers to the random behavior of the input.
        (In that spirit, it could easily be called Las Vegas.)
        Expert judgment. In quantitative risk analysis, expert judgment can be used to validate the col-
        lected risk data and the analysis used for the project at hand.
        The risk register is updated with the results of the quantitative risk analysis.


        Output of the Quantitative Risk Analysis:
        Updated Risk Register
        The risk register that was used as an input item to the quantitative risk analysis is updated
        with the results of this analysis. The updates include the following:
             Probabilistic analysis of the project. This includes the estimates of the project
             schedule and cost with a confidence level attached to each estimate. Confidence level
             is expressed in percentage form, such as 95%, and it represents how certain you are
             about the estimate. You can compare these estimates to the stakeholders' risk toler-
             ances to see whether the project is within the acceptable limits.
             Probability of achieving the project objectives. Factoring in project risks, you can
             estimate the probability of meeting project objectives, such as cost and schedule, set
             forth by the current project plan. For example, the likelihood of completing the pro-
             ject within the current budget plan of $2 million is 70%.
             Prioritized list of risks. Risks are prioritized according to the threats they pose or
             the opportunities they offer. Risks with greater threats (or opportunities) are higher
             on the list. The goal is to prioritize the response plan efforts to eliminate (or mini-
             mize) the impact of the threats and capitalize on the opportunities. The priorities
             are determined based on the total effect of each risk to the overall project objectives.
             Trends in the results. By repeating the analysis several times and examining the
             results, you might recognize a trend for specific risks. That trend might suggest fur-
             ther analysis or a specific risk response. In finding the trend, you can also take a look
             at the historical information on project cost, quality, schedule, and performance.
        The emphasis in quantitative analysis is on two tasks: Assess the probability of meeting each
        project objective and prioritize the risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall
        project objectives. Subsequently, the resultant prioritized list of risks can be used to prepare the
        risk response plan.

Planning Risk Response
   Depending on the project, the nature of risks, and the experience of the team, risk response
   planning can start after risk identification, qualitative risk analysis, or quantitative risk analy-
   sis. But if qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk analysis are performed on the risk, then
   the response planning must come after these analyses. Recall that risks can include threats (neg-
   ative risks) and opportunities (positive risks). Accordingly, the central task in risk response plan-
   ning is to develop actions and options to meet the following two goals:
        Minimize threats to meeting project objectives
        Maximize opportunities



                TIP
         Remember the five-pronged golden rule for risk response planning, AARCO: A risk
         response must be appropriate to the significance of the risk, agreed upon, realistic
         within the context of the project, cost effective, and owned by a team member.



   As shown in Figure 6.11, the risk management plan and risk register are the input items to
   risk response planning.

Input to Risk Response Planning
   The only two input items for risk response planning are the risk register and the risk manage-
   ment plan.
214   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Risk register. The risk register contains the results from risk identification, qualitative risk
        analysis, and quantitative risk analysis. The following elements of the risk register are espe-
        cially useful for risk response planning:
                List of identified risks
                Root causes of risks
                Prioritized list of risks
                List of risks that need immediate attention
                Trends in analysis results
        Risk management plan. The elements of the risk management plan that can be useful for risk
        response planning include the following:
             Organizations' and stakeholders' thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks to sort
             out those risks for which response is needed.
             Roles and responsibilities that specify the positions and functions for each position
             involved in risk management. These roles are assigned to members of the risk man-
             agement team, which might include members from inside or outside the project team.
             Timing and a schedule that specifies how often the risk management processes will
             be performed and which risk management activities will be included in the project
             schedule.
        Because there is a wide spectrum of risks that can occur, there are a multitude of tools and tech-
        niques available to plan responses for these risks.


   Tools and Techniques for Risk Response Planning
        Risk, as you have already learned, can come in two categories: negative risks, which pose threats
        to meeting the project objectives, and positive risks, which offer opportunities. The goal here
        is to minimize the threats and maximize the opportunities. In project management, there are
        three kinds of possible responses to risks--take an action, take no action, or take a conditional
        action. When you want to take an action, different response strategies for negative and posi-
        tive risks need to be planned. Accordingly, there are three kinds of strategies available to han-
        dle three kinds of scenarios:
             Strategies to respond to negative risks (threats) when action is required
             Strategies to respond to positive risks (opportunities) when action is required
             Strategies that can be used to respond to both negative and positive risks when no
             action or a conditional action is taken


        Response Strategies for Threats
        There are only three commonsense ways to take an action against a potential problem: Get out
        of harm's way, pass it to someone else, or confront it to minimize the damage. In project man-
        agement, these three strategies are called avoid, transfer, and mitigate--the ATM approach.
        PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                      Chapter 6       215


Avoid. You avoid risk by changing your project management plan in such a way that the risk
is eliminated. Depending upon the situation, this can be accomplished in various ways, includ-
ing the following:
     Obtaining information and clarifying requirements for risks based on misunder-
     standing or miscommunication. This answers two questions: Do we really have this
     risk, and, if yes, how can we avoid it?
     Acquiring expertise for risks that exist due to a lack of expertise.
     Isolating the project objectives from the risk whenever possible.
     Relaxing the objective that is under threat, such as extending the project schedule.
Transfer. Risk transfer means you shift the responsibility for responding to the risk (the own-
ership of the risk), the negative impact of the risk, or both to another party. Note that trans-
ferring the risk transfers the responsibility for risk management and does not necessarily
eliminate the risk. Risk transfer almost always involves making payment of a risk premium to
the party to which the risk has been transferred. Some examples include buying an insurance
policy and contracting out the tasks involving risk.
Mitigate. Mitigation in general means taking action to reduce or prevent the impact of a dis-
aster that is expected to occur. Risk mitigation means reducing the probability of risk occur-
rence, reducing the impact of the risk if it does occur, or both. A good mitigation strategy is to
take action early on to first reduce the probability of the risk happening, and then to plan for
reducing its impact if it does occur, rather than letting it occur and then trying to reduce the
impact or repair the damage. Following are some examples of mitigation:
     Adopting less complex processes
     Conducting more tests on the product or service of the project
     Choosing a more stable supplier for the project supplies
     Designing redundancy into a system so that if one part fails, the redundant part
     takes over and the system keeps working
Each of these three strategies has a counter-strategy to deal with the opportunities.


Response Strategies for Opportunities
Just like in the case of threats, you have three strategies to deal with opportunities. Not sur-
prisingly, each response strategy to deal with an opportunity is a counterpart of a response strat-
egy to deal with a threat--a one-to-one correspondence:
     Share corresponds to transfer
     Exploit corresponds to avoid
     Enhance corresponds to mitigate
You use the SEE (share, exploit, enhance) approach to deal with opportunities presented by
the positive risks.
216   Part II      PLANNING THE PROJECT


        Share. Sharing a positive risk that presents an opportunity means transferring ownership of the
        risk to another party that is better equipped to capitalize on the opportunity. Some examples
        of sharing are:
             Forming risk-sharing partnerships
             Starting a joint venture with the purpose of capitalizing on an opportunity
             Forming teams or special-purpose companies to exploit opportunities presented by
             positive risks
        Exploit. Exploiting an opportunity means ensuring that the opportunity is realized--that is,
        the positive risk that presents the opportunity does occur. This is accomplished by eliminating
        or minimizing the uncertainty associated with the risk occurrence. An example of exploiting is
        assigning more talented resources to the project to reduce the completion time and therefore
        to be the first to market. Another example could be to provide better quality than planned to
        beat a competitor. Whereas exploiting refers to ensuring that the positive risk occurs, enhanc-
        ing refers to increasing the impact of the risk once it occurs.
        Enhance. This strategy means increasing the size of the opportunity by increasing the proba-
        bility, impact, or both. You can increase the probability by maximizing the key drivers of the
        positive risks or by strengthening the causes of the risks. Similarly, you can increase the impact
        by increasing the project's susceptibility to the positive risk.
        You have just learned the different strategies that you need to plan for negative and positive
        risks if you intend to take action. If, on the other hand, you intend to take no action or a con-
        ditional action, then the response planning strategies for both negative and positive risks are
        the same.


        Response Strategies for Both Threats and Opportunities
        There are two response strategies that you need to plan for the risks for which you need to take
        either a conditional action or no action.
        Acceptance. Acceptance of a risk means letting it be. Generally, it is not possible to take
        action against all risks. Depending upon their probabilities and impacts, some risks will sim-
        ply be accepted. There are two kinds of acceptance:
             Passive acceptance that requires no action
             Active acceptance that requires a conditional action, called a contingent response
        Contingency. Generally speaking, contingency means a future event or condition that is pos-
        sible but cannot be predicted with certainty. So, your action will be contingent upon the con-
        dition; that is, it will be executed only if the condition happens. In risk management, a
        contingent response is a response that is executed only if certain predefined conditions (or
        events) happen. These events trigger the contingency response. Some examples of such trig-
        gers are missing a milestone or escalating the priority of a feature by the customer. The events
        that can trigger contingency response must be clearly defined and tracked.
             PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                    Chapter 6       217



                  CAUTION
           While designing a response to a risk, also design a backup plan to fall back on in
           case the response does not work. Also, think through and plan for responding to the
           risks that the response to the original (primary) risk may cause. These risks are
           called secondary risks.


     You use these strategies to generate the output of the risk response planning process.

   Output of Risk Response Planning
        The output of risk response planning might include risk register updates, risk-related contrac-
        tual agreements, and project management plan updates.
        Risk register updates. The appropriate risk responses planned and agreed upon by the risk
        management team are included in the risk register. The responses to high and moderate risks
        are entered in detail, while the low-priority risks can be put on a watch list for monitoring.
        After the risk register is updated, it includes the following main elements:
             A list of identified risks, descriptions of the risks, root causes of the risks, WBS ele-
             ments affected by the risks, and impacts of the risks on the project objectives.
             Roles and responsibilities in managing the risks--that is, risk owners and the
             responsibilities assigned to them.
             Results from qualitative and quantitative risk analyses, including a prioritized list of
             risks, a probabilistic analysis of the project objectives, and a list of risks with time
             urgency.
             Planned and agreed-upon risk response strategies and specific actions to implement
             each strategy.
             Symptoms and warning signs of risk occurrences, contingency plans, and triggers for
             contingency risks.
             Budget and schedule requirements to implement the planned responses, including
             the contingency reserve, which is the amount of funds, time, or both needed in addi-
             tion to the estimates in order to meet the organization's and stakeholders' risk toler-
             ances and thresholds.
             Fallback plans in case the planned responses prove to be inadequate
             A list of risks to remain, which include the following:
              Passive, accepted risks
              Residual risks that will remain after planned responses have been performed
             A list of secondary risks that will arise as a result of implementing the responses.
             You must plan for these risks like any other risk.
        Updates to the project management plan. Risk response planning is a very involved and seri-
        ous process. It may affect many components of the project management plan. You should go
        back and modify that component accordingly. For example, a risk response plan may require a
        change in the schedule, and therefore you will need to update the schedule management plan.
        Similarly, changes in budget and tolerance level as a result of planning a response should trig-
        ger updates to the cost management plan and quality management plan. Other plans that may
        be affected by risk response planning include the procurement management plan and the
        human resource management plan. These changes may also include or trigger changes in the
        cost baseline, the schedule baseline, and the WBS.
          PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT                                     Chapter 6         219



               NOTE
        A residual risk is the remains of a risk on which a response has been performed,
        whereas a secondary risk is a risk that is expected to arise as a result of implement-
        ing a risk response; therefore, a response for a secondary risk must be planned.



  Risk-related contract decisions. The decisions for risk-related contractual agreements might
  result, for example, from the decisions of transferring risks. Mitigating the risks may also have
  an option to contract it out, and hence a contract will be necessary. A positive risk can also be
  contracted out to maximize the opportunity it offers and share the resulting benefit with the
  vendor to which it is contracted out.
  Updates to project documents. In addition to the risk register and project management plan,
  risk response planning may also cause updates to other project documents. For example, new
  information that becomes available during risk planning may change an assumption. This will
  require an update of the project scope statement (if it contains that assumption) or the assump-
  tion document, such as the assumption log, if you are keeping assumptions separate from the
  scope statement. You may also need to change some technical documents due to changes in
  the technical approach as a result of risk response plans.
  In a nutshell, risk response planning deals with both kinds of risks--those that pose threats to
  meeting project objectives and those that present opportunities. Three kinds of responses can
  be planned--take action, take no action, or take a conditional action.
  I have discussed quite a few processes used in quality management and risk management. It is
  time to put them together to show how they are related to each other in the big picture.



The Big Picture of Quality and
Risk Management
  In this chapter, I have introduced the processes used in managing the quality and risks of a
  project. As shown in Figure 6.12, quality management and risk management can begin after
  project scope planning, schedule planning, and cost planning have been performed.
  Note that Figure 6.12 presents a general and high-level view of the relationships between dif-
  ferent processes used to manage quality and risk, and not all the interactions and data flow are
  shown. For example, depending on the nature of the risk and the experience of the risk man-
  agement team, a risk might move directly from the identification process to quantitative risk
  analysis or even to the risk response planning process.
220   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT




      FIGURE 6.12 A high-level view of the processes used in quality management and risk management.

        You might be overwhelmed by the input items that go into various processes. Table 6.3 pre-
        sents a unified picture of the main input items for various quality and risk-related processes.
        Following are the main points emerging from this picture:
              The scope statement is an input to quality planning, risk management planning,
              identifying risks, and performing qualitative risk analysis. You can realize this only if
              you remember that the scope statement is a component of the scope baseline.
              The risk management plan, generated during the Plan Risk Management process, is
              an input to all other risk planning processes.
              The risk register is initiated by the risk identification process and is an input item to,
              and is updated by, the following risk management processes: Perform Qualitative
              Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses. It will
              also be updated by the Monitor and Control Risks process, which we will explore in
              an upcoming chapter.

The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
     The goal for quality planning is twofold: Identify which quality standards are rele-
     vant to the project at hand and determine how to satisfy these standards.
     The risk identification process initiates the risk register by listing the identified risks
     in it. Qualitative risk analysis prioritizes these risks based on the probability and
     impact matrix for each objective, whereas the emphasis in quantitative risk analysis is
     on assessing the probabilities of meeting each project objective and prioritizing the
     risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project objectives.
     The goal for risk response planning is to minimize the threats (the negative effects
     of risks) and maximize the opportunities (the positive effects of risks).
222   Part II       PLANNING THE PROJECT



   Summary
        Quality and risk are two interrelated aspects of any project and need to be managed. While
        quality refers to the degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables and objec-
        tives fulfill the requirements, risk refers to an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has
        a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives. Quality management includes
        quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control. The quality management plan, quality
        metrics, quality checklist, and process improvement plan are the major output items of the qual-
        ity planning process called Plan Quality. The only output of risk management planning is the
        risk management plan, which includes elements such as a list of tools and approaches to be
        used for risk management, identification and assignment of resources for risk management, risk
        categories, risk probabilities and impacts, and the format of risk reporting and tracking. This
        information is used in the remaining processes of risk management--Identify Risks, Perform
        Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses.
        The risk management plan is an input item to the risk identification process. Its only output
        is the risk register, which includes a list of identified risks, a list of the root causes of the risks,
        and an initial list of potential responses. The risk register, initially prepared during the risk iden-
        tification process, is updated during the following processes: Perform Qualitative Risk Analy-
        sis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks.
        The main output of qualitative risk analysis is the prioritization of risks based on a probabil-
        ity and impact matrix for each objective. Each objective might have its own prioritized list of
        risks. However, the emphasis in quantitative analysis is on two things--assessing the proba-
        bility of meeting each project objective and prioritizing the risks based on the total effect of
        each risk on the overall project objectives. Subsequently, the resultant prioritized list of risks
        can be used to prepare the risk response plan.
        Depending upon the priority of the risk, you can choose one of the three options--taking no
        action, taking an action if some event happens, or taking an action. When you decide to take
        an action, there are three ways to plan it: avoid, transfer, or mitigate in case of a negative risk;
        and share, exploit, or enhance in case of a positive risk.
        After you have planned for various management aspects of the project, including scope, sched-
        ule, cost, quality, and risk, you need to proceed toward executing the project. This subject is
        explored in the next part of this book.

Exam's Eye View
Comprehend

 Quality management has two components: project quality management and product quality
    management. While product quality management techniques depend upon the specific product
    that the project is going to produce, project quality management applies to all projects inde-
    pendent of the nature of the products.

 Risk categorization is a part of the risk management plan, and it helps in the risk identification
    process.

 Defining risk probability and risk impact are parts of the risk management plan and are used
    in qualitative risk analysis and in prioritizing risks.

 Risk identification is performed before risk analysis, and qualitative risk analysis, if performed,
    is performed before quantitative risk analysis because it takes less effort and time and its results
    can be used for quantitative analysis.

 An important update added to the risk register by the qualitative risk analysis is the prioritized
    list of risks. Each objective can have its own prioritized list of risks.

 Two important updates added to the risk register by the quantitative risk analysis are:
     The probabilistic analysis of the project objectives--that is, the probability of meeting the
        project objectives

     The prioritized list of risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project
        objectives

Look Out

 A fundamental tenet of quality: Quality is planned, designed, and built in, not inspected in.
 Risk stems from elements of uncertainty and can have a negative or a positive effect on meet-
    ing the project objectives.

 Quality planning and risk management planning processes have identical sets of input items.
 A residual risk is the remains of a risk on which a response has been performed, whereas a sec-
    ondary risk is a risk that is expected to arise as a result of implementing a risk response.

 Depending upon the experience of the team and the nature of the risk, a risk can be moved
    directly after identification to the quantitative risk analysis or even to risk response planning.
224   Part II          PLANNING THE PROJECT


         Memorize

          The quality management plan, quality checklists, the process improvement plan, and quality
                metrics are the major output items of the quality planning process.

          The risk register is initially prepared during the risk identification process and is updated dur-
                ing the following processes: qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, risk response
                planning, and risk monitoring and controlling.

          The quality management plan and risk management plan become part of the project manage-
                ment plan.

          Planning for scope, schedule, and cost needs to be performed before you can plan for quality
                and risk management.

          The only output of risk management planning is the risk management plan.




   Key Terms and Definitions
             assumptions analysis. A technique used to examine the validity of an assumption
             and thereby identify the risk resulting from the inaccuracy, inconsistency, or incom-
             pleteness of each assumption.
             benchmarking. Comparing practices, products, or services of a project with those of
             some reference projects for the purposes of learning, improvement, and creating the
             basis for measuring performance.
             confidence level. A statistical term that refers to the certainty attached to an esti-
             mate and is often represented in percentage form, such as a 95% confidence level.
             contingency. A future event or condition that is possible but cannot be predicted
             with certainty. In this case, an action will be contingent upon the condition--that is,
             the action will be executed only if the condition happens.
             contingency reserve. The amount of funds, time, or both needed in addition to the
             estimates in order to meet the organization's and stakeholders' risk tolerances and
             thresholds.
             COQ. Cost of quality; the total cost of quality-related efforts throughout the prod-
             uct lifecycle.
             decision tree analysis. A technique that uses a decision tree diagram to choose from
             different options available; each option is represented by a branch of the tree. EMV
             analysis is done along each branch, which helps to make a decision about which
             option to choose.
             Delphi technique. An information-gathering technique used for experts to reach a
             consensus while sharing their ideas and preferences anonymously.

 Expected Monetary Value (EMV) analysis. A statistical technique used to calculate
 the expected outcome when there are multiple possible outcome values with proba-
 bilities assigned to them.
 experiment design. A statistical method that can be used to identify the factors that
 can influence a set of specific variables of a product or a process under development
 or in production.
 methodology. A system of procedures and techniques practiced in a discipline to
 accomplish a task. For example, risk management methodology is used in the disci-

 ter that is expected to occur.
 model. A set of rules to describe how something works, which takes input and
 makes predictions as output.

 uncertain elements (that is, variables) and takes them as input to a model to generate
 output. In other words, it simulates a model by feeding randomly selected input
 values.
 performance measurement baseline. An approved integrated plan for the project
 specifying some parameters to be included in the performance measurements, such
 as scope, schedule, and cost. The performance of the project is measured against this
 baseline. Some technical and quality parameters can also become part of this base-
 line.
 qualitative risk analysis. A process used to prioritize risks by estimating the proba-
 bility of their occurrence and their impact on the project.
 quality. The degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables and
 objectives fulfills the project requirements.
 quality baseline. A criterion that specifies the quality objectives for the project and
 thereby makes the basis for measuring and reporting the quality performance.
 quality management plan. A management plan that describes how the project man-
 agement team will implement the quality policy of the performing organization for
 the specific project.
 quality metrics. An operational criterion that defines in specific terms what some-
 thing (such as a characteristic or a feature) is and how the quality control process
 measures it.
 quality planning. The process of identifying the quality standards relevant to the
 project at hand and determining how to satisfy these standards.
 quality policy. Overall intentions and high-level direction of an organization with
 respect to quality, established by management at the executive level.

                             group.
Introduction
  After a project has been planned using the processes in the planning process group, it needs to
  be executed using the processes in the executing process group. The project team determines
  which of the processes in the executing process group are relevant to the project at hand. The
  goal of the execution stage is to complete the project work specified in the project manage-
  ment plan to meet the project requirements. To accomplish that, you will need to acquire,
  develop, and manage the project team. Your organization might not have the resources to fin-
  ish certain parts of this work. You will need to use procurement for those parts of the work.
  You also need to ensure that all the planned quality activities are performed. This is accom-
  plished by using the quality assurance process.
  Directing and managing project execution is the process of implementing the project man-
  agement plan developed during project planning. The end product of this process is the pro-
  ject deliverables. This is a high-level umbrella process under which other execution processes
  are performed, such as assuring quality and conducting procurements. So the core question in
  this chapter is how to execute a project as planned. In search of an answer, you will explore
  three avenues--directing and managing project execution, assuring quality, and conducting
  procurements.



Executing a Project: Big Picture
  The project work defined in the project management plan is executed by using the processes
  in the executing process group, shown in Figure 7.1. As I said earlier, it is up to the project
  team to determine which of these processes is relevant for the project at hand. The processes
  in this group are used to accomplish a three-pronged goal:
       Coordinate people and resources used to perform the project activities
       Integrate and manage the project activities being performed
       Ensure the implementation of the project scope and approved changes
  The following list defines the processes shown in Figure 7.1.
       Direct and manage project execution. Manage various interfaces in the project exe-
       cution to complete the project work smoothly in order to produce the project out-
       come, such as deliverables and objectives.
       Acquire project team. Obtain the project team members needed to perform the pro-
       ject work.

FIGURE 7.1 The processes used in executing a project. All of these processes (except the Manage
               Project Team process) belong to the executing process group.

 Develop project team. Improve the competencies of team members and interaction
 among team members to enhance project performance.
 Manage project team. Manage the project team, which includes tracking the per-
 formance of team members, providing feedback, resolving issues, and managing
 changes to improve project performance.
 Perform quality assurance. Audit the results from the quality control measurements
 to ensure that the quality requirements are being met.
 Distribute information. Make the relevant information about the project, such as
 project progress, available to the stakeholders according to the communication man-
 agement plan.
 Conduct procurements. Obtain responses from potential sellers in terms of quotes,
 bids, offers, and proposals for their product or services needed for the project; select
 sellers; and negotiate written contracts with the selected sellers.
 Manage stakeholder expectations. Stay on the same page with the stakeholders by
 communicating and working with them on their needs and issues.
236     Part III       EXECUTING THE PROJECT



                       NOTE
                A project is usually started with a project kickoff meeting that can also be used as the
                beginning of team development. The kickoff meeting is discussed in Chapter 8,
                "Developing and Managing the Project Team."



      STUDY CHECKPOINT 7.1
      List the processes of the executing process group.



          In this chapter, we will cover the Direct and Manage Project Execution, Perform Quality
          Assurance, and Conduct Procurements processes. Once project execution starts, it needs to be
          managed, which is accomplished by using the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.



   Directing and Managing Project
   Execution
          The project work defined in the project management plan is performed using the Direct and
          Manage Project Execution process. While executing this process, you will be interacting with
          other processes and departments in your organization. In general, a project team includes peo-
          ple from different departments. Usually the reporting relationships within the same department
          are very well defined and structured. However, the relationships between different depart-
          ments (especially between individuals from different departments at the same level of author-
          ity) are not well defined. So, managing such project interfaces is a crucial function of a project
          manager during project execution. Generally speaking, project interfaces are the formal and
          informal boundaries and relationships among team members, departments, organizations, or
          functions--for example, how the development department and the QA department interact
          with each other while working on the same project. Directing and managing project execution
          is the process used to manage various technical and organizational interfaces in the project to
          facilitate smooth execution of the project work.
          The main purposes of directing and managing project execution are:
                   Producing the project deliverables by executing the project management plan
                   Implementing the approved changes, defect repairs, and other actions
                   Implementing the planned methods, processes, and standards
                   Producing and distributing status information

   The key words during execution are implement, manage, and inform (status). Figure 7.2 illus-
   trates the Direct and Manage Project Execution process with its input, tools and techniques,
   and output.




       FIGURE 7.2 The Direct and Manage Project Execution process: input, tools and techniques, and
                      output.


Input to Directing and Managing Project Execution
   The input to directing and managing project execution mainly consists of the items that need
   to be implemented. The information on the project work that needs to be performed to pro-
   duce project deliverables is the major input to this process. The specific input items are dis-
   cussed in the following list.
   Project management plan. Directing and managing project execution is all about implement-
   ing the project management plan, which contains all the major subsidiary plans, such as the
   scope baseline, the schedule baseline, the cost baseline, and the quality baseline. It also describes
   how the work will be executed to meet the project objectives and produce deliverables that sat-
   isfy the planned requirements.
   Approved change requests. The following approved change-related items are input to the pro-
   ject execution because they must be implemented.
        Change requests. The approved requests for changes to the project schedule, scope,
        cost, policies, procedures, and project management plan need to be implemented and
        therefore are the input to the execution process. These change requests are scheduled
        for execution by the project management team.
        Defect repairs. This is the list of defects found during the quality assurance (QA)
        process that have been approved for repairs. This may also include the defects that
        were repaired, but the repair was not good enough to be accepted.
238     Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


               Corrective actions. The QA process can recommend corrective actions to improve
               quality, which are directions for executing the project work to bring expected project
               performance into conformance with the project management plan. The approved
               corrective actions must be scheduled for implementation.
               Preventive actions. These are directions to perform an activity that will reduce the
               probability of negative consequences associated with project risks. These preventive
               actions are recommended by the QA process during process analysis.
          Enterprise environmental factors. Items in this category that can be useful or need to be
          considered in directing and managing project execution include organizational structure and
          culture; company infrastructure, such as facilities and equipment; personnel administration,
          such as hiring and firing guidelines; and project management information systems. Stakeholder
          risk tolerance is also an important input factor to directing and managing project execution.
          Organizational process assets. Items in this category that can be useful or need to be consid-
          ered in directing and managing project execution include standardized work guidelines, work-
          place security requirements, project files from previous projects, and the issue and defect
          management database. For example, the defect management database may contain a list of val-
          idated defect repairs with information on whether a previously performed defect repair has been
          accepted or rejected. This will tell you whether you need to implement the defect repair again.
          Communication requirements and process measurement database are also important input to
          directing and managing project execution.

      True or False: Approved change requests are processed through the Perform Integrated Change
      Control process.



          In a nutshell, the project management plan and approved change requests are the major input
          to directing and managing project execution because executing the project is all about imple-
          menting the project management plan along with the approved change requests. You direct and
          manage the execution by using some tools, which will be discussed in the next section.


   Tools and Techniques for Directing and
   Managing Project Execution
          The major tool to direct and manage project execution is the project management information
          system, which is a collection of tools and techniques--manual and automated--used to gather,
          integrate, and disseminate the output of project management processes. This may include auto-
          mated scheduling tools; a configuration management system; an information entry, storage, and
          distribution system; and interfaces to other online systems. This system is used to facilitate
          processes from the initiation stage all the way to the closing stage. Microsoft Project, a prod-
          uct that lets you create a project schedule, is an example of such a tool.
                                      MANAGING PROJECT WORK                         Chapter 7          239


   Another tool used in directing and managing project execution is expert judgment, which,
   depending on the issue and the available resources, can be provided by the project manager,
   other individuals from other departments and groups within the organization, consultants,
   stakeholders, or professional associations.
   The project is executed to produce some results, which will be the output of directing and man-
   aging the execution.


Output of Directing and Managing Project Execution
   When the project is being executed, at each point in time there are some deliverables with parts
   thereof completed, and there is a status for the project that can be reported to the stakeholders.
   These two important output items, along with others, are discussed in the following paragraphs.
   Deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and identifiable product, service, or result identified in
   the project management plan that must be generated to complete the project. The core pur-
   pose of executing the project management plan is to produce deliverables.
   When you are directing and managing project execution, obviously the items are being imple-
   mented. In addition to the work that produces original deliverables, the following items are
   implemented during project execution:
           Approved change requests
           Approved corrective actions recommended by the QA process
           Approved preventive actions recommended by the QA process
           Approved defect repairs recommended by the QA process
   Change requests. During the execution of the project work, requests for changes may arise
   from sources such as issues and may affect certain aspects of the project, such as the following:
           Project scope
           Project cost
           Project schedule
           Policies or procedures
   These change requests might come from inside or outside the performing organization and can
   be optional or mandated legally or contractually. These change requests must be approved
   before they can be processed and implemented. These change requests can include the follow-
   ing types:
        Direct change requests. These are changes that are not a result of any other action,
        such as defect repair. Examples are requests for changes to scope, schedule, and cost.
        Of course, these changes can also result from other change requests, listed below.
240   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


             Indirect change requests. These include:
              Defect repairs. This is the list of the defects found during the quality assurance
                 (QA) process that have been approved for repairs.
              Corrective actions. The QA process can recommend corrective actions to
                 improve quality, which are directions for executing the project work to bring
                 expected project performance into conformance with the project management
                 plan. The approved corrective actions must be scheduled for implementation.
              Preventive actions. These are directions to perform an activity that will reduce
                 the probability of negative consequences associated with project risks. These pre-
                 ventive actions are recommended by the QA process during process analysis.
             After some change requests are approved, you may need to change some elements of
             the project management plan, such as the project baseline, human resource manage-
             ment plan, requirements management plan, or communication management plan.
        Work performance information. Monitoring the project status is one of the crucial functions
        of a project manager during project execution. Work performance information is basically the
        project status information that is regularly collected and distributed among the stakeholders
        during project execution. It includes the following items:
             The schedule progress information:
              Schedule activities that have been finished and those that have started
              Estimate to complete the schedule activities that have started and hence are in
                progress
              The portion of each in-progress activity completed in a percentage--for exam-
                ple, Activity A is 30% complete
              Deliverables that have been completed and those that have not yet been
                completed
             Incurred costs compared to authorized costs
             Resource utilization details
             How well the quality standards are being met
             Lessons learned and added to the knowledge base
        In a nutshell, the main output of directing and managing project execution is the project deliv-
        erables specified in the project management plan and the performance data as the work pro-
        gresses. Between planning the project and producing the deliverables, many things need to
        happen, and you need to manage them by:
                 Distributing information
                 Managing stakeholder expectations
                 Acquiring, developing, and managing the project team
                 Performing quality assurance
                 Conducting procurements

  Therefore, the Direct and Manage Project Execution process is a high-level umbrella process,
  and to execute it you need to perform some other processes too, which are discussed in this
  and the next chapters. To start with, assuring quality is an integral part of managing project
  execution.
  In addition to performing the project work to produce the project deliverables, a significant
  task to perform during project execution is quality assurance, an essential component of pro-
  ject work.



Performing Quality Assurance
  Quality planning, discussed in Chapter 6, is used to identify which quality standards are rele-
  vant to the project at hand and to determine how to meet these standards. Implementing qual-
  ity management consists of the following two components:
       Quality assurance (QA). Quality assurance is the process of auditing the results
       from quality control measurements to ensure that the quality requirements are being
       met. This process is used during the execution of the project, and I discuss it in this
       section.
       Quality control. This refers to monitoring and controlling the project results to
       ensure they meet the agreed-upon quality standards. This topic is covered in an
       upcoming chapter.
  Performing organizations typically have a department called quality assurance (QA) that over-
  sees the quality assurance activities and fosters continuous process improvement, which is an
  iterative method for improving the quality of all processes.



              TIP
        Continuous process improvement enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the
        processes by minimizing waste (unnecessary activities) and duplication of efforts. It
        includes identifying and reviewing the business processes inside the organization,
        such as coding of modules within software programs and the process of project
        approval.



  Figure 7.3 depicts the Perform Quality Assurance process.

            FIGURE 7.3 The Perform Quality Assurance process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


   Input to Performing Quality Assurance
        The input to the quality assurance process comes largely from three sources: quality planning,
        directing and managing project execution, and quality control. The quality-related output items
        of these three processes become the input to the quality assurance process. These input items
        are discussed here.
        Output from quality planning. The following output items from the quality planning process
        become the input to the quality assurance process:
             Quality management plan. This plan is the output of the quality planning process
             discussed in Chapter 6, and it describes how QA will be performed for this project.
             Quality metrics. A quality metric is an operational criterion that defines in specific
             terms what something (such as a characteristic or a feature) is and how the quality
             control process measures it. The quality metrics developed during quality planning,
             such as defect density, failure rates, reliability, and test coverage, must be employed
             during QA.
             Process improvement plan. The process improvement plan, discussed in Chapter 6,
             helps improve the quality of the project and must be implemented during QA.
        Output from directing and managing project execution: work performance information.
        When you are directing and managing project execution, information about work perfor-
        mance and the implementation of a few items will help you determine how the quality is being
        implemented. Therefore, during QA, you must consider work performance information. Work
        performance information includes project status information that is regularly collected and dis-
        tributed among the stakeholders. It includes the following items:
             Schedule progress information:
              Schedule activities that have been finished and those that have started
              Estimates for the completion of schedule activities that have started and hence
                are in progress
                                     MANAGING PROJECT WORK                         Chapter 7          243


            Percentages to show the portion of each in-progress activity--for example,
              Activity A is 30% complete
            Deliverables that have been completed and those that have not yet been
              completed
           Incurred cost as compared to authorized cost
           Resource utilization details
           How well the quality standards are being met
           Lessons learned added to the knowledge base
   When you are directing and managing project execution, obviously the items are being imple-
   mented. The following quality-related implemented items must be considered during QA:
           Implemented change requests
           Implemented corrective actions
           Implemented defect repair
           Implemented preventive actions
   Output from quality control: quality control measurements. Quality control involves mon-
   itoring specific project results to verify whether they meet quality standards. The quality con-
   trol process sends its results back to QA as feedback.
   Approved change requests. Approved change requests, such as modification of work meth-
   ods, product requirements, quality requirements, scope, and schedule, must be analyzed for their
   effect on the quality management plan and quality metrics.



               TIP
         All approved changes should be formally documented. Unapproved and undocu-
         mented changes (for example, changes just verbally discussed) must neither be
         processed nor be implemented.



   Some tools and techniques can be used to facilitate the QA process.


Tools and Techniques for Performing Quality Assurance
   Quality audits and process analysis, along with the tools and techniques used in quality plan-
   ning and quality control processes, can be used in the QA process.
   Quality audits. A quality audit is a structured and independent review to determine whether
   project activities comply with the policies, processes, and procedures of the project and the
   performing organization. It verifies the implementation of approved change requests, correc-
   tive actions, defect repairs, and preventive actions. Audits can occur as scheduled or at random
244   Part III        EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        and can be conducted by a third party or by properly trained in-house auditors of the per-
        forming organization. The main objectives of quality audits are the following:
                Identify all good practices
                Identify shortcomings and gaps in implementing what was planned
                Offer assistance for improvement and share knowledge gathered from the imple-
                mentation of good practices at similar projects
                Record contributions from each audit in the lessons learned database of the project
        These audits accomplish the following:
                Because one of the objectives of a quality audit is to identify inefficient and ineffec-
                tive policies, processes, and procedures being used for the project, audits reduce the
                cost of quality on subsequent projects.
                Audits increase customer satisfaction and acceptance of the product or service deliv-
                ered by the project.
        Process analysis. This is a technique used to identify the needed improvements in a process
        by following the steps outlined in the process improvement plan. It examines the problems,
        constraints, and unnecessary (non-value-added) activities identified during the implementation
        of the process. Process analysis typically includes the following steps:
          1. Identify a technique to analyze the problem.
          2. Identify the underlying causes that led to the problem.
          3. Examine the root cause of the problem.
          4. Create preventive actions for this and similar problems.

        Other tools and techniques. The tools and techniques used in the following processes can
        also be used in the QA process:
                Quality planning, already discussed in Chapter 6
                Quality control, discussed in an upcoming chapter
        The quality assurance process recommends corrective actions as an output item.


   Output of Performing Quality Assurance
        The main output of performing quality assurance includes recommended corrective actions and
        change requests. These and other output items are discussed in the following list.
        Change requests. The goal of quality assurance is improving quality, which involves taking
        actions to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the policies, procedures, and processes of
        the performing organization. One way of accomplishing this is to implement the quality-related
                                      MANAGING PROJECT WORK                         Chapter 7          245


    changes recommended and approved during the process of directing and managing the project
    execution, including:
          Modifications to policies and procedures.
          Modifications to project scope, cost, and schedule.
          Recommended corrective actions. Implementation of recommended corrective
          actions will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the policies, processes, and
          procedures of the performing organization and will also improve the quality of the
          product or service delivered by the project. Following are examples of the types of
          recommended actions:
           Audits
           Process analysis that itself might produce a list of preventive actions
           Defect repair, such as bug fixes in a software program
    Updates. As a result of the QA process, you might need to add updates to the following:
          Organizational process assets. The quality standards, policies, procedures, and
          processes of the performing organization are the organizational assets that can be
          updated during the QA process.
          Project management plan. The quality assurance process can result in updates to
          the project management plan in the following ways:
           Changes to the quality management plan, which is a part of the project manage-
              ment plan.
           Quality audits may cause changes to the schedule management plan and cost
              management plan.
          Other documents. Other project documents that may be modified as a result of QA
          include process documentation, quality audit reports, and training plans.

    In some projects you might not find the resources in your organization to complete certain parts
    of the project. This is where the concept called procurement comes into the picture.
246   Part III       EXECUTING THE PROJECT



   Conducting Procurements
        As you learned in Chapter 5, procurement refers to obtaining (purchasing or renting) prod-
        ucts, services, or results from outside the project team to complete the project. Procurement
        management is an execution of a set of processes used to obtain (procure) products, services,
        or results from outside the project team to complete the project. Procurement planning was dis-
        cussed in Chapter 5, and implementation of this plan, conducting procurement, is discussed in
        this section. Figure 7.4 illustrates the process used to conduct procurements.




            FIGURE 7.4 The Conduct Procurements process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


   Input to Conducting Procurements
        The input items to conducting procurements include the procurement management plan, pro-
        curement documents, and procurement-related organizational process assets. These input items
        are discussed in the following list.
        Procurement management plan. The major input to conducting procurements is the pro-
        curement management plan developed during procurement planning. The procurement man-
        agement plan may have the following items of interest:
                 Prequalified selected sellers
                 Procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts and evaluate sellers
                 Types of contracts to be used and the format for the contract statement of work
                 Assumptions and constraints that could affect planned purchases and acquisitions
                 Scheduled dates for contract deliverables
                 Directions to be provided to the seller on developing and maintaining a contract
                 work breakdown structure

Procurement documents package. This is the set of procurement documents put together dur-
ing procurement planning. The buyer structures these documents with two goals in mind:
    To facilitate an accurate and complete response from each prospective seller
    To facilitate easy evaluation of the responses
These documents include the following:
     A description of the desired form of the response
     A relevant contract statement of work
     Any required contractual provisions, such as a copy of a model contract, and non-
     disclosure provisions



             TIP
      In government contracting, some or all of the content and structure of a procurement
      document might already be defined by regulations.



Different terms are used for these documents for different purposes:
     A term such as bid, tender, or quotation is used when the seller selection decision will
     be based on the price, when buying commercial or standard items.
     A term such as proposal is used when multiple factors are considered, such as cost,
     technical skills, and technical approach.
     Common names for these different kinds of documents include invitation for bid,
     request for quotation, tender notice, request for proposal, and contractor initial response.
The procurement documents should be rigorous enough to ensure consistent responses from
different sellers that can be fairly compared to one another and flexible enough to allow sell-
ers to offer suggestions on better ways to satisfy the requirements. How are the requests sent
to the potential sellers? This is done according to the policies of the buyer's organization--for
example, publication of the request in the public media, such as newspapers, magazines, and
the Internet.


             NOTE
      Bids and quotations are typically used to ask for prices, whereas proposals are used
      to ask for solutions. Invitations for bid, requests for quotation, and requests for pro-
      posal travel from buyer to seller, whereas bids, quotations, and proposals travel from
      seller to buyer.
248   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        Source selection criteria. Also called evaluation criteria, this is developed by the buyer during
        procurement planning to rate responses from the sellers. The evaluation criteria could be as
        simple as the price for off-the-shelf standard items, or it could be a combination of factors for
        a more complex proposal. Following is a list of some examples of evaluation criteria.
             Cost. To evaluate the overall cost, you should consider all cost-related factors, such as:
              Purchase price
              Delivery cost
              Operating cost
             Business aspects. This can include the following factors:
              Business size and type. Does the business size or type meet a condition set forth
                 in the contract, such as being a small business or a disadvantaged small business?
              Financial capacity. Does the seller have the financial capacity to do the job, or is
                 the seller in a position to obtain the necessary financial resources to do the job?
              Production capacity and interest. Does the seller have the capacity and the
                 interest to meet future potential requirements?
              References. Can the seller provide reliable references (such as from previous cus-
                 tomers) verifying the seller's work experience and history of compliance with
                 contractual requirements?
             Management approach. If the procurement itself involves a project, does the seller
             have the ability to execute management processes and procedures to run a successful
             project?
             Rights. The following rights can be considered:
              Intellectual property rights. Will the seller own the intellectual property rights
                 for the work processes or services that will be used to produce the deliverables?
              Proprietary rights. Will the seller have the proprietary rights for the work
                 processes or services that will be used to produce the deliverables?
             Technical aspects. This includes the technical approach and capability:
              Technical approach. Will the technical methodologies, techniques, solutions, or
                 services proposed by the seller meet the procurement requirements, or will they
                 provide more than the expected results?
              Technical capability. Does the seller have or is the seller capable of acquiring
                 the technical skills and knowledge required to produce the deliverables?
        Partner agreements. You might be considering some sellers that already have some contracts
        or agreements signed with your organization. These agreements, also called teaming agreements,
        must also be honored while conducting procurements.
                                       MANAGING PROJECT WORK                           Chapter 7       249


   Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets relevant to requesting seller
   responses include the following:
           A preexisting list of prospective sellers
           A list of previously used or qualified sellers
           Information about past experiences with previously used sellers
           Organizational policies that could affect evaluating the responses and selecting the
           sellers.
   Make-or-buy decisions made during procurement planning should also be considered during
   this process of conducting procurements. This topic was discussed in Chapter 5.


Tools and Techniques for Conducting Procurements
   The first goal for the tools and techniques here is to find sellers and provide them with infor-
   mation about the requests for responses. The list of potential sellers can be developed from
   various sources, such as the World Wide Web, library directories, relevant local associations,
   trade catalogs, and the performing organization's internal information base. The main tech-
   niques used in soliciting seller responses are advertising and bidder conferences. These and
   other techniques used in conducting procurements are discussed in the following list.
   Bidder conferences. This refers to meetings with prospective sellers prior to preparation of a
   response to ensure that the sellers have a clear understanding of the procurement, such as the
   technical and contractual requirements. These meetings can generate amendments to the doc-
   uments. All potential sellers should be given the same amount of information (or help) during
   this interaction so that each seller has an equal opportunity to produce the best response.
   These conferences are also called contractor conferences, vendor conferences, or pre-bid conferences.


                NOTE
         In some cases, after a proposal is submitted, the buyer can request that the seller
         supplement its proposal with an oral presentation to provide some additional informa-
         tion, which can be used to evaluate the seller's proposal.



   Proposal evaluation techniques. Different techniques can be used to evaluate responses from
   sellers. All these techniques can use expert judgment and evaluation criteria. The common fac-
   tors that can be considered in the evaluation include the following:
        Price. This can play a primary role in the selection of off-the-shelf standard items.
        However, you should consider that the lower price does not mean lower cost if the
        seller does not deliver on time.
250   Part III        EXECUTING THE PROJECT


             Multiple aspects. Proposals are usually evaluated for different aspects, such as tech-
             nical and commercial. Technical refers to the overall approach, whereas commercial
             refers to the cost.
             Multiple sources. For products critical to the project, multiple sources (sellers)
             might be required. This redundancy will help mitigate such risks as failure to meet
             the delivery schedule or quality requirements.
        Some techniques used to make the final selection of sellers are discussed in the following list:
             Independent estimates. The purpose of independent estimates is to have a check on
             the proposed pricing by the seller. The procuring organization prepares the indepen-
             dent estimate in house or has it done by a third party. Significant differences
             between the proposed price and the independent estimate mean that either the mar-
             ket has changed or the seller has failed to offer reasonable pricing due to such rea-
             sons as failure to understand the contract statement of work. The independent
             estimates are also called should-cost estimates.
             Seller rating system. A seller's rating does not depend on a specific response that
             you are evaluating. Rather, the seller's rating comes from the seller's rating system,
             which is developed by multiple organizations based on multiple factors related to
             seller's past performance, such as delivery performance, contractual compliance, and
             quality rating.
             Weighting system. The purpose of putting a weighting system in place is to have an
             objective evaluation as opposed to a subjective evaluation influenced by personal
             prejudice. The weighting system uses a method to quantify the qualitative data and
             typically involves the following steps:
                  Assign a numerical weight to each of the evaluation criteria according to its
                 1.
                  importance, such as w1, w2, and w3 for three criteria, and make these weights
                  the same for each seller.
             2. Rate the seller on each criterion, such as r1, r2, and r3. These ratings depend
                  upon the seller.
             3. Multiply the weight by the rate for each criterion.
             4. Add the results in the previous step to compute an overall score, such as s1 for
                  seller 1: s1 = r1 x w1 + r2 x w2 + r3 x w3.
             Expert judgment. Expert judgment is made by a committee that consists of experts
             from each of the disciplines covered by the procurement documents and the pro-
             posed contract. The committee can include experts from functional disciplines, such
             as accounting, contracts, engineering, finance, legal, manufacturing, and research and
             development.


                      TIP
              Sellers in procurement are also sometimes called sources.
                                    MANAGING PROJECT WORK                           Chapter 7       251


Screening system. A screening system consists of minimum requirements as a threshold that
must be met if the seller is to stay in the list of candidate sellers. It might, for example, consist
of one or more evaluation criteria. The screening system can also use the weighting system and
independent estimates.
Procurement negotiations. Procurement negotiations, also called the contract negotiations, have
the following two-pronged goal:
     Clarify the structure and requirements of the contract
     Reach an agreement
Subjects covered during the negotiations might include the following:
        Applicable terms and laws
        Authorities, rights, and responsibilities
        Business management and technical approaches
        Contract financing
        Payments and price
        Proprietary rights
        Schedule
        Technical solutions
The conclusion of contract negotiations is a document, the contract, which can be signed by
both the buyer and the seller. The final contract signed by both parties can be an offer by the
seller or a counteroffer by the buyer. Sometimes for simple procurement items, the contract is
nonnegotiable.



             TIP
      A contract is a mutually binding legal relationship subject to remedy in court. The pro-
      ject manager might not be the lead negotiator on the contract. However, the project
      manager might be required to be present during negotiations to provide any neces-
      sary clarification on the project requirements.



Advertising. The request for seller responses can be advertised in the public media or in rele-
vant professional journals. Whether to use advertising depends on the organization's policy.
However, some government jurisdictions require public advertising of pending government
contracts.
Internet search and expert judgment are other tools that can also be used during conducting
procurements.
252   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


   Output of Conducting Procurements
        The output of conducting procurements includes the list of selected sellers and the contract
        awards for the selected sellers. These and other output items are discussed in the following
        paragraphs.
        Selected sellers. This is the list of sellers that you have selected as a result of response
        evaluations.
        Procurement awards. These are the contracts awarded to selected sellers. A contract is a legal
        document that obligates the seller to provide the specified products, services, or results and
        obligates the buyer to make the payment to the seller. The contract can be a simple purchase
        order or a complex document, depending on the nature of the procurement. A contract can
        include, but is not limited to, the following sections:
                 List of deliverables and statement of work
                 Schedule
                 Acceptance criteria
                 Change-request handling
                 Inflation adjustments
                 Insurance
                 Limitation of liability
                 Penalties and incentives
                 Pricing and payment
                 Product support
                 Roles and responsibilities
                 Termination and dispute-handling mechanism
                 Warranty
        Resource calendars. This contains information on the quantity and availability of the con-
        tracted (procured) resources--for example, the dates on which a resource will be active or idle.
        Changes and updates. Conducting procurements can generate changes and updates such as
        the following:
             Change requests. The selection process can generate change requests for the project
             management plan and its subsidiary plans and components, such as the project
             schedule and the procurement management plan. These change requests must be
             processed through the integrated change control system before implementation.
                                        MANAGING PROJECT WORK                           Chapter 7       253


         Updates to the procurement management plan. If a procurement-related change
         request is approved, the procurement management plan should be updated to reflect
         the change. This may include the scope baseline, schedule baseline, cost baseline,
         and procurement management plan. These changes or updates arise from the fact
         that procurement and the rest of the project are related to each other. For example, a
         change in the procurement fulfillment date will affect the schedule that depends on
         that fulfillment.


STUDY CHECKPOINT 7.4
What is the main goal of the Conduct Procurements process?



    The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
         The Direct and Manage Project Execution process is a high-level process to produce
         project deliverables. To accomplish this, you need to do two things:
         1. Acquire the project team, develop it, and manage it to perform the project
              activities.
         2. Procure the items that cannot be produced by the project team.
         Use the Perform Quality Assurance process to ensure that the project employs all the
         planned processes and standards needed to meet all the project quality requirements.
         The procurement plan is implemented by using the Conduct Procurements process,
         which involves requesting seller responses, evaluating seller responses, selecting sell-
         ers based on the evaluation, and negotiating and signing contracts with the selected
         sellers.


Summary
    The project management plan is executed using the processes in the executing process group.
    The high-level umbrella process in this group is the Direct and Manage Project Execution
    process, whose main goal is to produce the project deliverables. A significant task to perform
    during project execution is quality assurance, which involves auditing the results from quality
    control measurements to ensure that quality requirements are being met. Due to a lack of
    resources in the performing organization, you might need to obtain some products, services, or
    results from outside the project team to complete the project. This is called procurement. The
    Conduct Procurements process is used to implement the procurement plan, which involves
    obtaining seller responses, selecting sellers based on the responses, and reaching an agreement
    with the selected sellers, such as a contract to obtain (procure) the products, services, or results.
    To perform the project work, you need to put together a project team and develop and man-
    age the team to obtain optimal results for the success of the project. This is the topic of the
    next chapter.
254   Part III          EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        Exam's Eye View
         Comprehend

          Executing the project means implementing the project management plan developed during
             project planning.

          Directing and managing project execution involves managing various technical and organiza-
             tional interfaces in the project to facilitate smooth execution of the project work.

          The execution of a project is managed by performing the process called Direct and Manage
             Project Execution, a high-level umbrella process for the executing stage, which generates the
             project deliverables.

          Quality assurance, an important task during project execution, is the process of auditing the
             results from quality control measurements to ensure that the quality requirements are being met.

          Conducting procurement is the process of obtaining responses from potential sellers, selecting
             sellers based on those responses, and awarding contracts to the selected sellers.

         Look Out

          The two major output items of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are project
             deliverables and work performance information or data.

          Quality audits are a tool used in quality assurance.
          Tools and techniques used in quality planning and quality control are also used in quality
             assurance.

          Invitations for bid, requests for quotation, and requests for proposal travel from buyer to seller,
             whereas bids, quotations, and proposals travel from seller to buyer.

         Memorize

          The project management plan is the major input to the Direct and Manage Project Execution
             process.

          The input to the quality assurance (QA) process comes from the output of three processes:
             quality planning, quality control, and direct and manage project execution.

          In procurement, a term such as bid, tender, or quotation is used when the seller selection deci-
             sion will be based on the price when buying commercial or standard items, whereas a term
             such as proposal is used when multiple factors are considered, such as cost, technical skills, and
             technical approach.

          Bids and quotations are typically used to ask for prices, whereas proposals are used to ask for
             solutions.

Introduction
  Executing a project requires resources, and executing a project successfully requires the opti-
  mal use of resources. Thereby, coordinating and managing resources, including human
  resources, is an integral part of project execution. During project planning, you define roles
  and assign responsibilities to those roles. Individuals who play these roles perform the respon-
  sibilities of the roles to execute the project work. The process of obtaining the individuals to
  fill these roles and therefore become the members of the project team is called acquiring the pro-
  ject team. A team is a group of individuals who perform individual responsibilities to work inter-
  dependently on their independent assignments. From a scientific viewpoint, a team is a dynamic
  entity, and its dynamics are determined by the interaction among its members. Therefore, for
  the team to be successful, it has to be effective in both dimensions: Its members must be com-
  petent in performing their individual assignments, and the interaction among them must be
  overall constructive. To ensure that, you need to continually develop and manage the project
  team. To obtain the right individuals for the project team and to develop and manage the team
  is an art, whereas the effective team taking the project to success is a science that will unfold
  itself automatically if you do the art part right.
  So the core question in this chapter is how to build and manage a high-performance project
  team. In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues--acquiring project team members,
  developing the project team, and managing the project team.



Human Resource Management: Big
Picture
  As shown in Figure 8.1, human resource management as part of project management means
  developing the human resource plan, acquiring the project team, developing the project team,
  and managing the project team.
       Acquire Project Team. This is the process of filling the roles determined during
       human resource planning with actual staff assignments.
       Develop Project Team. This is the process of developing an optimal team by
       improving the individual competencies, improving the interaction among the indi-
       vidual team members, and thereby improving the team environment.
       Manage Project Team. This is the process of tracking performance of and providing
       feedback to the individual team members, managing changes related to the team,
       and resolving issues.
   DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                                          Chapter 8       261




      FIGURE 8.1 Big picture of human resource management.

  The project team has two dimensions: independence and interdependence. Each member has
  an independent assignment in the sense that the member owns that part of the work, is respon-
  sible for completing it, and must have the competency to complete it. However, all these indi-
  vidual assignments may have dependencies among them, requiring the team members to
  interact effectively.
  In a nutshell, you hire the individuals, but you need a team to complete the project success-
  fully. The team needs to be developed from the individuals and managed.



Acquiring a Project Team
  The project work will be executed by the project team, and therefore the role of the team in
  the success of the project is crucial. So, it is critical to acquire the right project team for your
  project. You accomplish this through the Acquire Project Team process illustrated in Figure
  8.2. Roles and responsibilities for the roles required to complete the project are defined during
  the human resource planning process, discussed in the previous chapter. Before the work can
  start, the roles need to be assigned to real individuals who will become the members of the
  project team. These individuals might come from different departments, and the project man-
  agement team might have no direct control over them. So, these team members need to be
  acquired through a process like the one shown in Figure 8.2.
  The major input to the acquire team process comes from the human resource planning dis-
  cussed in the previous chapter.

        The human resource planning process generates the output that contains the staffing manage-
        ment plan, the project organizational chart, and the roles and responsibilities. These items are
        major inputs to the process of acquiring a project team. These and other input items are dis-
        cussed in the following paragraphs.
        Human resource plan. You need this document because acquiring the project team is one of
        several processes that implement the human resource plan. It has useful items relevant to
        acquiring the project team, such as a list of roles and responsibilities required for the project,
        project organizational charts, and a staffing management plan.
             Roles and responsibilities. Roles with specific responsibilities are defined in the
             human resource planning process based on the project work that needs to be per-
             formed. These roles will be the guide to finding suitable candidates for the project
             team, because the team members will play these roles.
             Project organizational chart. This chart gives you a quick overview of the number
             of team members needed and their relationships to each other.
             Staffing management plan. A staffing management plan is an important input item
             to acquiring the project team because it provides detailed information about the roles
             that need to be filled, such as the start and end dates for a role. This information is
             necessary to match the candidates with the roles.



                     TIP
              In the worst-case scenario, you will not be able to negotiate for staff, and you will have
              no influence on the staff assignments. Unless a team member is not qualified to do the
              job, you will have to live with the staff assignment decision and make the best of it. If
              you choose to challenge one of these assignments, make sure you are doing this based
              on hard facts, such as lack of skills required to perform the assigned activity.

Enterprise environmental factors. The enterprise environmental factors are important in
obtaining project team members because the team members can come from various sources
inside and outside the performing organization. These factors include organizational struc-
ture, administrative policies of your organization regarding outsourcing, availability of team
members within the performing organization, and human resource information in the per-
forming organization. For example, the team might include current employees of the per-
forming organization and contractors hired for the project. Depending on your enterprise
environment, you, the project manager (or the project management team), may or may not be
able to direct or influence the hiring and staff assignments. In either case, you must try to
obtain the best team you can. To determine who will be the best team, you need to do your
homework, which includes finding out the availability and abilities of the candidate team
members. When you do have an influence on making staff assignments, you should consider
the following characteristics:
     Availability. It is important to know whether and when the candidate is available
     before you attempt to obtain that member.
     Competency. Does the candidate have the skills needed to complete the schedule
     activities?
     Experience. Has the candidate performed similar work well in the past?
     Interests. What is the candidate's interest level in this project and in the work that
     will be assigned to him or her?
     Cost. What is the cost attached to each candidate in terms of pay? This is even
     more important if the member is a contractor.
Based on this information, build your dream team on paper and attempt to obtain that team.
If the team is spread out over different departments and hence the team members are under
the control of different functional managers, plan who you will ask for from each functional
manager. To make a request, meet with the manager and ask for your most wanted team mem-
ber first, even though it is very unlikely that you will get everyone you ask for. Before meeting
the functional managers, you need to prioritize your staffing needs. The most complex activi-
ties and the activities on critical paths should get special attention, and you should make sure
these activities have the best members because they have the highest risk potential. Having
assigned staff to these activities first, you have more flexibility to agree to a different resource
assigned to activities that are less complex and have a non-zero float time. Even though you
want to negotiate for the best team, keep a backup plan--that is, if you don't get the best
member, try to get the second best member, and so on.


             NOTE
      In a traditional organizational structure, you will not have direct control over the project
      team members, and you will need to acquire them by negotiating with functional man-
      agers. But you still need to do the homework that you would do if you were to interview
      the candidates because you still want to get the best members available for the job.
264   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        Organizational process assets. In the process of acquiring the project team, you should con-
        sider the following organizational process assets:
             Guidelines, policies, or procedures governing staff assignments that your organiza-
             tion may have
             Help from the human resources department in recruitment of and orientation for
             the team members
        To put together the best team, you need to understand the tools and techniques available for
        acquiring the team.


   Tools and Techniques for Acquiring the Project Team
        You will either negotiate with the functional manager for a team member to fill a role or you
        will acquire the team member from outside your organization, such as a contractor. Negotiation
        and acquisition are discussed in the following paragraph, along with other tools and techniques.
        Pre-assignment. In some cases, there will be some staff members already assigned to the pro-
        ject. This can happen, for example, due to the following situations:
             A staff member was promised as part of a specific proposal to compete with another
             proposal. Acceptance of this proposal automatically affirms that staff-member
             assignment.
             There is only one person in the organization who has the expertise to perform a spe-
             cific activity.
             A staff assignment was specified in the project charter.
        Negotiation. The project manager and the project management team should effectively nego-
        tiate and exert influence in a positive way to obtain the best possible team to complete the pro-
        ject work. The failure to acquire an effective team can result in missed deadlines, cost overrun,
        poor quality, and eventually a failed project. You will most likely need to negotiate with func-
        tional managers for the staff assignments for your project. In these negotiations, you have a
        two-pronged goal--to obtain the best available person for an activity and to obtain the person
        for the required timeframe. As described in the previous section, you must do your homework
        in order to get the best results from the negotiations.



                     TIP
              While negotiating with a functional manager, sometimes it's important to understand
              the functional manager's perspective in light of the politics of the organization. For
              example, a functional manager will weigh the benefits (for example, visibility of your
              project compared to that of competing projects) in determining where to assign the
              best performers. In this case, it is to your advantage to explain the importance of your
              project and the activity for which you are asking for the best performer.
 DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                                       Chapter 8      265


You may also be negotiating with project management teams of other projects who might be
competing to get team members from the same pool of human resources. Negotiation skills will
also be used to communicate with external organizations to hire or contract team members.
Acquisition. If the performing organization does not have the human resources to fill one or
more roles needed to finish the project, the required team member can be obtained from out-
side the organization as a contractor, or the corresponding work can be given to a source out-
side the performing organization. We will talk more about this area of procurement
management later in this chapter.
Virtual teams. Welcome to the information age triggered by the Internet. The process of work-
ing for an organization from outside its physical location is called telecommuting. The Internet
(along with other technological advances, such as teleconferencing, cellular phones, and pagers)
makes it possible to telecommute from your home in the same city where the organization is
or from a location on the other side of the globe with almost the same ease. Teams composed
of telecommuters are called virtual teams because the team works together on the same project
without holding face-to-face meetings. It is not difficult to find people who have worked on
virtual teams and have never seen the other team members face to face. I have worked on sev-
eral such teams, and I'm sure either you have or you will in the near future. The virtual team
format expands the team definition to offer the following benefits:
     People working for the same organization but living in different locations can join
     the same team.
     A needed expert can join a team even if the expert does not live in the same location
     as the rest of the team.
     The organization has the option to accommodate employees who can only work
     from their home offices for a certain period of time.
     Due to the availability of asynchronous communication means, such as e-mail and
     online bulletin boards, it is possible to form a team of members who have different
     work hours or shifts.
     Virtual teams eliminate or reduce the need to travel by using means of communica-
     tion that are abundantly available, such as e-mail, video conferencing, and the World
     Wide Web. This enables organizations to perform projects that were previously
     impossible due to the anticipated travel expenses.
Note that because the virtual team members are not at the same location and do not have reg-
ular face-to-face meetings, effective communication is that much more important for the suc-
cess of the project being performed by the virtual team. Therefore, communication management
is crucial to the success of virtual teams.
The team you are going to acquire could be a team at one location or a virtual team, and a
team member might be from your organization or from outside your organization. Whatever
the case may be, the team itself--that is, the staff assignments--is the major output of the
acquire team process--no surprise there.
266   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


   Output of Acquiring the Project Team
        The major outputs of the Acquire Project Team process are the staff assignments to fill the roles
        defined during human resource planning and the list of time periods for which the staff mem-
        bers will be available. These and other output items are discussed in the following list.
             Project staff assignments. This document contains the list of individuals assigned to
             the project. It can also include memos sent to team members, the project organiza-
             tion chart, and the schedule with the names inserted.
             Resource calendars. This document includes the time periods for which each assigned
             member can work on the project. Possible schedule conflicts, commitments to other
             projects, and times when a team member is not available can also be recorded.
             Updates to the project management plan. As a result of staff assignments, some
             parts of the project management plan will be modified. For example, the project
             team is acquired by matching the staffing requirements specified in the staffing
             management plan to the candidates. Hardly ever is there a perfect match between
             the two. During the process of acquiring the project team, you might realize that the
             staffing management plan needs to be updated. Other updates to the staffing man-
             agement plan might come from the following sources:
              Promotions
              Retirements
              Illnesses
              Performance issues
              Changing workloads
        After staff assignments have been made, you have the raw material out of which you need to
        develop the special team for your project.



   Developing the Project Team
        Your project team can consist of members from different departments and disciplines, regular
        employees and contractors, and experts from different disciplines. Some of these individuals
        might not have much appreciation for others' disciplines. You have a challenge to develop this
        diverse group into a cohesive and efficient team that will perform the project on time, within
        budget, and with quality. The single goal of team development is to maximize project perfor-
        mance. This is accomplished by introducing three elements:
             Improve the competencies of team members
             Improve the interaction among team members
             Improve the overall team environment
        This will help you develop a cohesive and competent team to meet the project objectives
        effectively.
 DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                                         Chapter 8       267



             TIP
      Each team member should be the owner of the piece of work assigned to the mem-
      ber, and hence should be fully responsible for it. That said, teamwork and team spirit
      are critical factors for the project success. It's the responsibility of the project man-
      ager to create an environment that supports teamwork and team spirit.


As Figure 8.3 shows, the major output of the Acquire Project Team process is the input to
the Develop Project Team process. The team development starts with a list of team members
and the staff assignments made during the Acquire Project Team process. The resource avail-
ability list provides information about when the team members are available for team devel-
opment activities. The following items of the staff management plan can be useful for team
development:
     Training strategies
     Plans for developing the project team
     Recognition and rewards systems




    FIGURE 8.3 The Develop Project Team process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

As discussed in the following paragraphs, there are some standard tools and techniques that
you can use to develop a winning team.
Ground rules. A very important management technique is to establish clear expectations at
the very beginning of a project. The expectations can be set up by establishing a set of ground
rules. Early commitment to these guidelines will increase cooperation and productivity by
decreasing misunderstandings. Once the rules are clearly established, all team members are
responsible for enforcing them.
268   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        Training. The goal of training is to improve the competencies of the project team members,
        which in turn helps in meeting the project objectives. Training might be aimed at individual
        members or at the team as a whole, depending upon the needs. The training might be sched-
        uled in the staff management plan, or it might result from observations, conversations, and pro-
        ject performance appraisals as the project progresses. Following are examples of some training
        methods:
                 Coaching
                 Mentoring
                 On-the-job training of a team member by another team member
                 Online training
                 Instructor-led classroom training
        Interpersonal and general management skills. General management skills, especially inter-
        personal skills, are necessary to develop an effective team. You and the project management
        team can minimize problems and maximize cooperation by understanding the sentiments of
        team members, anticipating their actions, acknowledging their concerns, and following up on
        the issues. To accomplish this, the following interpersonal management skills are necessary:
             Effective communication. This is needed to facilitate the smooth flow of necessary
             information among the team members.
             Ability to influence the organization. This is needed to get things done.
             Leadership. This is needed to develop a vision and strategy and to motivate people
             to achieve that vision. During a time of possible uncertainty, such as changes in
             upper management, you should clarify the situation and help the team stay focused
             on the project.
             Motivation. This is needed for energizing team members to achieve high levels of
             performance and to overcome barriers to change. During times when the team is in
             a low-morale mode, you should be able to lift the team morale and thereby con-
             tribute to team development.
             Negotiation and conflict management. This is needed to work with team members
             to resolve their conflicts and facilitate negotiations when necessary in resolving con-
             flicts or in task assignments. Depending on the nature of the conflict, you can take it
             as a team development opportunity. Effective resolution of a conflict contributes to
             team building.
             Problem solving. This ability is needed to define, analyze, and solve problems.
        Team management is further discussed later in this chapter.


                     NOTE
              Interpersonal skills are also called soft skills, as opposed to hard skills, which refer to
              technical skills and capabilities.
 DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                                         Chapter 8       269


Team-building activities. Team-building activities can range from indirect team-building
activities, such as participating in constructing the WBS, to direct team-building activities, such
as social gatherings where the team members can get to know each other and start feeling
comfortable with each other. While planning such activities, you should keep in mind that team
members might have different interests and different levels of tolerance for games and differ-
ent icebreakers.
The project kickoff meeting is another indirect method to start team development. This can
be used as a formal way to introduce team members and other stakeholders and spell out the
project goals for everyone at the same time. An ideal kickoff meeting is a combination of seri-
ous business and fun. The goal is to align the team with the project goals and to help team
members feel comfortable with each other.
In planning the kickoff meeting, you can assume that team members have the following ques-
tions in their heads that need to be answered before the end of the meeting:
        Why am I here?
        Who are you and what are your expectations of me?
        What is this team going to do?
        How is the team going to do its work?
        How do I fit into all this?
Consider the following steps to make your kickoff meeting successful:
     Agenda. Putting the meeting agenda in the hands of the team members always
     helps to run the meeting more smoothly and effectively and keep it on the track.
     Welcome. Take immediate charge of the meeting by introducing yourself and wel-
     coming the participants. Quickly walk through the agenda and set the stage for the
     rest of the meeting.
     Project overview. Define the project, its goals, and its deliverables. Introduce the
     project team members and briefly describe their roles. The goal is to provide a big
     picture and to help individual team members figure out how they fit into the big
     picture.
     Expectations. Many project team members might not already know you and your
     management style. You should take this opportunity to set expectations about how
     the team will function. For example, state that you expect all team members to
     attend weekly status meetings. Remind the team to focus on the project goal, to do
     their part, and to look out for one another in a team spirit.
     Guest speakers. Depending upon the size and the visibility of the project, you
     might also invite relevant guest speakers, such as the project sponsor, the customer,
     or an executive stakeholder. Before the meeting, spend some time communicating
     with the guest speaker about the message to deliver.
     Closure. Ask for feedback and hold a question-and-answer session before closing
     the meeting.
270   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        Remember that the main purpose of the kickoff meeting is to bring every team member onto
        the same page regarding the big picture of the project. Don't get bogged down discussing every
        item in detail.
        You should know that team development is not an instant process. Generally speaking, when
        you form a team, it goes through five stages of development (according to the Tuckman model),
        as shown in Figure 8.4 and explained in the following list.
             Forming. This is the orientation stage, with high dependence on the leader (the
             project manager, in this case) for guidance and direction. Individual roles and
             responsibilities are unclear, and there is little agreement on the team goals other than
             those received from the leader. Processes are often ignored, and team members test
             the tolerance of the system and the leader. It's time to establish ground rules and
             clear expectations. The leader directs in this stage.
             Storming. This stage represents the struggle for control and power as team mem-
             bers work to establish themselves relative to other team members. The clarity of
             team goals increases, but some uncertainties persist. Compromises might be required
             to make progress. Coaching and training can play effective roles during this stage.
             Norming. This is the routine stage during which consensus and agreement about
             team goals generally prevails among team members. Roles and responsibilities are
             clear and accepted by team members. Major decisions are made by group agree-
             ments, and smaller decisions can be delegated to appropriate team members. During
             this stage, the leader facilitates.
             Performing. This is the productivity stage in which the team knows what it's doing
             and why. The team is functioning in a cohesive mode and working toward the com-
             mon goal in a more autonomous fashion. Disagreements might arise, but they are
             resolved within the team in a constructive way. During this stage, the leader dele-
             gates and oversees.
             Adjourning. This is the closure stage. When the mission for which the team was
             formed is accomplished (or cancelled), the team is adjourned to free the team mem-
             bers to move on to other things.




            FIGURE 8.4 The five progressive stages of team development in the Tuckman model.

Being aware of these stages of team development will help you to better understand the behav-
iors of team members and thereby develop your team more effectively.
Co-location. This technique keeps all (or most) of the project team members in the same phys-
ical location to improve communication and to create a sense of community among team mem-
bers. In this age of virtual teams, this is not an increasingly popular technique, but when most
of the team members are in the same location, this technique is a default choice. It can include
a war room, which is a meeting room used for regular face-to-face meetings. Also, when the
project is being executed by a virtual team, the co-location technique can be used to put
together some team members at crucial times of the project.
Recognition and rewards. Generally speaking, people feel motivated if they feel that their con-
tributions and efforts are recognized and valued. Rewards are effective methods to express
recognition. The recognition and rewards strategy set up during the human resource planning
process can be used to develop the project team. Remember the following rules in setting up a
fair reward system:
     Only desirable behavior should be rewarded.
     Any member should be able to win the reward.
     Win-lose rewards, such as team member of the month, can hurt the team
     cohesiveness.
     The cultural diversity of the team should be considered and respected.
The effects of team development efforts are measured by the team performance assessment, the
major output of the Develop Project Team process, which includes the following indicators:
     Improvement in individual skills that enables a team member to perform project
     activities more efficiently.
     Improvement in team skills that help the team to improve overall performance and
     work more effectively as a group.
     Increased team spirit or cohesiveness: Team members interact in a constructive way
     and help each other to meet the project objectives.
     Reduced staff turnover rate.
While developing your team, you may need to modify some enterprise environmental factors,
such as training records and skill assessment.
In addition to team development, the project team needs to be managed throughout the
project.
272   Part III         EXECUTING THE PROJECT



   Managing the Project Team
        You manage the project team by using the Manage Project Team process, which is aimed at
        improving the project performance by executing the following tasks:
                   Resolving issues
                   Coordinating changes
                   Tracking the performance of each team member
                   Providing feedback to the team members



                       TIP
                 Managing the project team involves activities from hiring to firing and therefore requires
                 a wide spectrum of management skills, including communication, conflict management,
                 negotiation, and leadership. On one hand you should provide challenging assignments,
                 and on the other hand you should recognize and reward high performance.



        Figure 8.5 depicts the Manage Project Team process.




            FIGURE 8.5 The Manage Project Team process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


   Input to Managing the Project Team
        The main input to managing the project team comes from the output of human resource plan-
        ning, acquiring the project team, and developing the project team.
        Human resource plan. As examples, the following items in the human resource plan, part of
        project management plan, are the input to the Manage Project Team process:

        Staffing management plan. Contains information such as training plans, compli-
        ance issues, and certification requirements, along with the time periods when the
        team members are expected to work.
   Project staff assignments. Obviously, you should know who your team members are and what
   they are supposed to be doing. So, project staff assignments, an output of the Acquire Project
   Team process, are an obvious input to managing the project team.
   Performance information. The following items regarding performance are input to the Man-
   age Project Team process:
        Team performance assessment. This is the output of the Develop Project Team
        process discussed earlier in this chapter. Performance assessments provide important
        information that can be used in managing a team member and in managing the
        team. These assessments can be the basis to identify issues and address them. Some
        examples are the need to resolve conflicts, the need for training, and the need to
        modify communication.
        Performance reports. Performance reports contain the progress of the project
        against the baseline data, such as the schedule baseline, the cost baseline, and the
        quality baseline. They basically reflect how the project resources are being used to
        achieve the project objectives. The information from the performance reports helps
        determine future human resource requirements, updates to the staffing management
        plan, and recognitions and rewards.
   Organizational process assets. The project management team can use the following organi-
   zational assets in managing the project team:
        The organization's policies, procedures, and system for rewarding the team members.
        Certificates of appreciation, recognition dinners, and bonus structures are some
        examples.
        Other items that should be available to the project management team for use in
        managing the team, such as bulletin boards, newsletters, and internal websites for
        information sharing.
   To manage the team effectively, you should be aware of the tools and techniques that can be
   used for that.


Tools and Techniques for Managing the Project Team
   The tools and techniques used in managing the team include interpersonal skills, observation
   and conversation, conflict management, an issue log, and project performance appraisals. Inter-
   personal skills were discussed earlier in this chapter. Other tools and techniques are discussed
   in the following paragraphs.
274   Part III       EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        Observation and conversation. Observations and conversations are both means to stay in
        touch with the work and attitudes of the project team members. The indicators to monitor
        these include the following:
             Progress toward completion of assigned activities and therefore project deliverables
             Distinguished accomplishments contributing to the project performance
             Interpersonal issues
        Conflict management. The purpose of conflict management is to nourish the positive work-
        ing relationships among the team members that result in increased productivity. Common
        sources for conflicts include the following:
                 Scarce resources resulting in unsatisfied needs
                 Scheduling priorities
                 Personal work styles
                 Perceptions, values, feelings, and emotions
                 Power struggles
        You can reduce the number of conflicts by setting ground rules, clearly defining roles and
        goals, and implementing solid project management practices.


                     TIP
              Differences of opinion should not be considered as sources of conflict. If managed
              properly, differences can be very healthy and can lead to better solutions and thereby
              increase productivity.


        Initially, project team members who are parties to a conflict should be given the opportunity
        to resolve it themselves. If the team members fail to resolve the conflict and it becomes a neg-
        ative factor for the project, you, the project manager, should facilitate the conflict resolution,
        usually in private and using a direct and collaborative approach. If the conflict continues, you
        might have no option other than to use formal procedures, such as disciplinary actions.
        Different project managers normally use various styles or methods under different situations.
        The choice of the conflict resolution style or technique may be influenced by the following
        factors:
             Whether the conflict needs to be resolved for the long term or a short-term resolu-
             tion is fine
             The intensity of the conflict and the relative importance of resolution in the context
             of the project
             The urgency of resolving the conflict
             The positions taken by the parties involved in the conflict
 DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                                      Chapter 8          275


The first step in conflict management is analyzing the nature and type of conflict, which
might involve asking questions. You can meet with (interview) the parties involved in the con-
flict. The next step is to determine the management strategy. Different management strategies
are summarized here:
     Avoidance. In this strategy, at least one party to the conflict ignores (or withdraws)
     from the conflict and decides not to deal with the problem. This strategy can be used
     by the project manager as a cooling-off period, to collect more information, or when
     the issue is not critical. However, if the issue is critical, this is the worst resolution
     strategy and can give rise to lose/lose situations if both parties withdraw or yield/lose
     situations if one party withdraws. This strategy is also called withdrawal strategy.
     Competition. In this approach, one party uses any available means to get its way,
     often at the expense of the other party. This is a win/lose situation. It can be justified
     under some situations, such as when the basic rights of a party in conflict are at stake
     or when you want to set a precedent. However, if used unfairly from a power position
     (such as if it is a management style), it can be destructive for team development. This
     strategy can cause the conflict to escalate, and the loser party might attempt to retali-
     ate. When used by a party in power, competition is also called forcing.
     Compromising. In this strategy, both parties gain something and give up some-
     thing. This is a lose-win/lose-win strategy. You can use this strategy to achieve tem-
     porary solutions and to avoid a damaging power struggle when there is time
     pressure. The downside of this approach is that both parties can look at the solution
     as a lose/lose situation and can be distracted from the merits of the issues involved.
     In this way, the short-term solution can hurt the long-term objectives of the project.
     Accommodation. This strategy is the opposite of the competition strategy. One
     party attempts to meet the other party's needs at the expense of their own. This
     might be a justifiable strategy when the concerns of the accommodating party are
     less significant than the concerns of the other party in the context of the project.
     Sometimes it's used as a goodwill gesture. However, it is a lose/win approach (the
     accommodating party loses and the accommodated party wins), and the accommo-
     dating party runs the risk of losing credibility and influence in the future. However,
     when this strategy is applied carefully and both parties become accommodating, they
     can meet in the areas of agreement, and it can turn into a win/win situation. This is
     why this technique is also called smoothing.
     Collaboration. This strategy is based on reaching consensus among the parties in
     the conflict. Both parties work together to explore several solutions and agree on the
     one that satisfies the needs and concerns of both parties. This is a win/win strategy
     and is generally considered the best of all the strategies because it helps build com-
     mitment and promotes goodwill between the parties involved.
     Confronting. Some experts consider this approach as a variation of collaboration.
     You confront the problem causing the conflict head on and then solve that problem
     through an open dialogue and by examining several alternatives. This approach is
     also called problem solving.
276   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT




                     TIP
              You should always look for how the different processes overlap and interact with each
              other. For example, conflict management is a technique for managing the team. How-
              ever, the purpose of conflict management is to nourish positive working relationships
              among team members that result in increased productivity, so resolving a conflict can
              also be looked upon as a team development activity.



        Project performance appraisals. Conducting project performance appraisals includes evaluat-
        ing the performance of project team members and providing them with feedback based on the
        evaluation. The evaluation is based on information collected from several people interacting
        with the team member. This method of collecting information is called the 360-degree feedback
        principle because the information comes from several sources.
        The objectives for conducting performance appraisals include the following:
                 Providing positive feedback to team members in a possibly hectic environment
                 Clarifying roles and responsibilities
                 Discovering new issues and reminding of unresolved issues
                 Discovering the needs of individual training plans
                 Setting specific goals for the future



                     TIP
              You might find that the project managers in your organization are not responsible for
              performance appraisals. The need for formal or informal performance appraisals
              depends on the organization's policy, the contract requirements, and the size and
              complexity of the project.



        Issue log. Issues generally involve obstacles that can stop the project team from achieving the
        project objectives. A written log should be maintained that contains the list of team members
        responsible for resolving the issues by target dates. The purpose of the issue log is to monitor
        the issues until they are closed.
        While you are managing the team using these techniques, you might recommend some actions
        as an output of the Manage Project Team process.

           Not only can you earn quite a few points on the PMP exam, but you can also be a very
           effective project manager if you realize this: Confront the problem or the issue head on,
           but do your homework (investigate, research, or analyze) before taking action.



Output of Managing the Project Team
     The output from managing the project team includes recommended corrective and preventive
     actions, change requests, and updates to organizational process assets and the project manage-
     ment plan.
     Change requests. The Manage Project Team process might generate recommendations for cor-
     rective and preventive actions and other changes as discussed here:
          Recommended corrective actions. A corrective action is a direction for executing
          project work to bring future performance in line with what is expected in the project
          management plan. The corrective actions recommended during project team man-
          agement might include the following:
           Staffing changes, such as changing assignments of the team members, replacing
              team members (for example, ones who leave), and outsourcing some work
278   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


              Training for the team or for individual team members
              Recognition and rewards based on the reward system
              Disciplinary actions
             Recommended preventive actions. A preventive action is a direction to perform an
             activity to stop or reduce the probability of an anticipated event occurrence generally
             associated with a project risk. Preventive action can also be taken to reduce the
             anticipated impact of an event in case it happens. The preventive actions recom-
             mended during project team management might include the following:
              Cross-training so that, in the absence of a team member, another team member
                 can take over the assignment
              Role clarifications to ensure that all responsibilities associated with the role are
                 performed
              Planning for overtime in anticipation of extra work that might be needed to
                 meet project deadlines
        Other change requests and updates. The team management activities can generate some
        change requests for the project management plan. For example, staffing changes can generate
        requests for extending the schedule, increasing the budget, or reducing the scope. The change
        requests should be processed through the integrated change control system.
        Updates to organizational process assets. Several kinds of organizational process assets can
        be updated as a result of project team management. Here are some examples:
             Performance appraisals. The project staff member that interacts with a project team
             member in a significant way can offer input to the performance appraisal for that
             team member.
             Templates and organization's standard processes.
             Lessons-learned database. The lessons-learned database should be updated with the
             lessons learned during team management, which can come from different areas that
             include the following:
              Issues and solutions in the issue log
              Special skills and competencies discovered during project work for the team
                 members
              Successful and unsuccessful ground rules, conflict management techniques, and
                 recognition events
        Updates to the project management plan. Approved change requests and corrective actions
        can result in updates to the staffing management plan, which is a part of the project manage-
        ment plan. New role assignments, training plans, and reward decisions are some examples of
        updates.

               TIP
        Managing the project team is a complex task when the team members are accountable
        to both the project managers and the functional managers--for example, in a matrix
        organization. Effectively managing this dual relationship is critical to the success of the
        project and is therefore generally the responsibility of the project manager.




Motivating Your Team
  Because you have come so far in studying this book, I must say you are motivated to take the
  PMP exam, learn about project management, or both. So what is motivation? Motivation is
  an internal drive to meet a set of objectives. Internal drive is a state of unrest inside of you.
  This is how it goes. A need is a deficiency, an absence of something, a hole. Out of need arises
  the desire to fulfill the need. This desire or want represent dissatisfaction, which creates a state
  of unrest. This unrest is the drive. When drive is directed at a call for action to meet those
  objectives that will satisfy the need, it becomes motivation. In a nutshell, the need acts as a cat-
  alyst, like an enzyme in a biochemical reaction, that sets you on a journey toward meeting a set
  of objectives that will satisfy the need.
  If you want to get optimal results from your computers, you network them appropriately and
  execute appropriate software programs on appropriate drives in the network. If you want to
  achieve optimal results from your team, you create the appropriate drive in team members that
  will execute actions to meet project objectives; in other words, you motivate them.
  This is how important motivation is: Motivation to do some task plus the ability to do that task
  is equal to performance. So, lack of motivation means poor performance. In a project, motivation
  begins with you, the project manager. You must be motivated for the project and to motivate the
  project team members. It's always a good idea to have some formal knowledge of something that
  you are going to go through. So here, in a nutshell, are some theories of motivation.
  Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory. According to this theory, people have layers of needs, as
  illustrated in Figure 8.6, and until the lower-layer needs are satisfied, they will not move to
  satisfy the upper-layer needs. For example, if you are unemployed and broke, and as a result
  your very survival is in danger, you don't care about buying health insurance or life insurance
  or dating to look for a companion.
  Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory. This theory classifies the factors needed to motivate
  people into two categories: hygiene factors and motivating factors. Hygiene factors are neces-
  sary for motivation but not sufficient; they do not bring satisfaction, but they prevent dissatis-
  faction. Some examples are compensation; company policies; level of supervision or ownership
  of the assigned work; relationship with superiors, subordinates, and peers; and working condi-
  tions. Motivating factors are factors that bring (or increase) job satisfaction. Some examples
  are challenging work assignment, opportunity for career advancement and accomplishments,
  opportunity for growth, sense of responsibility, and recognition.
280   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT




            FIGURE 8.6 Illustration of Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs. Based on Motivation and
                          Personality (Harper and Row, 1970).


                    CAUTION
             Hygiene factors are related to the work environment, whereas motivating factors (also
             called motivators) are related to the work itself.



        McClelland's achievement motivation theory. According to this theory, the following three
        needs motivate people:
             Achievement. This is the need to perform well, achieve success, and get recognized
             for it. The key idea here is the drive to excel.
             Affiliation. This is the need or desire for good relationships at work. You want to
             feel connected at work.
             Power. This is the desire to move things, to influence people or events. The key
             term here is the world dominance or making a difference.
        McGregor's X-Y theory. According to McGregor, there are the following two types of managers:
             Theory X managers. These managers believe that most of the people (and hence
             the workers) are self-centered, are only motivated by their physiological and safety
             needs, and are indifferent to the needs of the organization they work for. They (the
             workers) lack ambition and have very little creativity and problem-solving capacity.

          As a result, they dislike their work and will try to avoid it. They will also avoid tak-
          ing responsibility and initiative. There is one word to describe Theory X managers:
          distrust. They distrust their employees. These managers, therefore, tend to be
          authoritarian.
          Theory Y managers. As opposed to Theory X managers, Theory Y managers trust
          their employees. They believe that most of the people are high performers in a
          proper work environment. This is because most of the people are creative and com-
          mitted to meeting the needs of the organization they work for. Theory Y managers
          also believe that most people like to take responsibility and initiative and are self-
          disciplined. Finally, they also believe that most people are motivated by all levels of
          needs in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These managers tend to provide more
          freedom and opportunity for career growth.
     Expectancy theory. According to this theory, people are motivated only if they expect a desired
     outcome or reward. The key idea here is: What is in it for me? The desired outcome here has
     two components: Objectives will be met with this effort, and the performers will be rewarded.

282   Part III       EXECUTING THE PROJECT



                     CAUTION
              The expectancy theory applied carelessly can backfire. For example, if the expected
              reward is unachievable or not worth the effort, people will lose motivation.



        The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
             To lay the foundations of your project success, you must negotiate to acquire a team
             that is capable of performing project work effectively and efficiently.
             You obtain individuals, and from those individuals you develop the team, and this
             development generally goes through these stages: forming, storming, norming, per-
             forming, and adjourning.
             Conflict resolution is a critical part of managing the team. Successful conflict resolu-
             tions are important for the success of the project.



   Summary
        The project management plan is executed using the processes in the executing process group.
        The high-level process in this group is the Direct and Manage Project Execution process,
        whose main goal is to produce the project deliverables. To make that happen, you need to put
        together a project team that will perform the project work, and you need to develop and man-
        age the team. You put together a project team using the Acquire Project Team process. The
        main output of this process is the project staff assignments, which become the input to the
        Develop Project Team process. This process uses training, recognition and rewards, and other
        team-building techniques to develop a cohesive and efficient team with high performance.
        You manage the project team using the Manage Project Team process to improve and opti-
        mize team performance.
        An effective and capable project team is essential for the success of the project. However, even
        if the project is technically successful, it really is not unless the stakeholders think it is. So, it
        is critical to manage stakeholder expectations while executing the project. This is the topic of
        the next chapter.
 DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                                               Chapter 8    283


Exam's Eye View
Comprehend

 The goal of the Acquire Project Team process is to fill the roles defined in the staffing man-
    agement plan with real individuals who will perform those roles to execute the project.

 Regardless of how much control you have over staff assignments, always try to obtain the best
    person for the job by doing your homework, which includes finding out the availability and
    competencies of the candidate team members.

 The staff assignments made through the Acquire Project Team process are the input to the
    Develop Project Team process, which uses techniques such as training, recognition and
    rewards, and other team-building activities to develop a high-performance team.

 You must manage the team in order to optimize its performance.

Look Out

 The project manager and the project management team should effectively negotiate and exert
    influence in a positive way to obtain the best possible team to complete the project work.

 The failure to acquire an effective team can result in missed deadlines, cost overrun, poor qual-
    ity, and eventually a failed project.

 Project staff assignments are an output of the Acquire Project Team process and are an input
    to the Develop Project Team and Manage Project Team processes.

Memorize

 Team development goes through five progressive stages: forming, storming, norming, perform-
    ing, and adjourning.

 Strategies used to resolve conflicts include avoidance, competition, compromise, accommoda-
    tion, confrontation, and collaboration. Collaboration is the best strategy because it offers a
    win/win resolution.

 The project management plan is an input item to the Acquire Project Team, Develop Project
    Team, and Manage Project Team processes because it contains the human resource plan.

   Key Terms and Definitions
                asynchronous communication. A communication in which the two communicating
                entities do not have to be present on both ends of the communication line at the
                same time. E-mail is an example of asynchronous communication because when the
                sender of the e-mail pushes the send button, the intended recipient of the e-mail
                message does not have to be logged on to the e-mail server.
                corrective actions. Directions for executing the project work to bring expected pro-
                ject performance in conformance with the project management plan. This is an out-
                put item of the QA process.
                issue log. A notebook or a database to track and manage issues. This process
                includes entering the issue, modifying its status, and closing the issue.
                preventive actions. Directions to perform an activity that will reduce the probability
                of negative consequences associated with project risks. These preventive actions are
                recommended by the QA process during process analysis.
                virtual team. A team of members working on the same project with few or no face-
                to-face meetings. Various technologies, such as e-mail, video conferencing, and the
                World Wide Web, are used to facilitate communication among team members.
                war room. A conference room used for project team meetings.

Introduction
  Even if your project succeeded according to the project management plan, it can be deemed as
  a failure if you did not do one thing right: managing project stakeholders. That is how impor-
  tant it is to manage project stakeholders effectively, which includes understanding and man-
  aging the influences and expectations of the stakeholders. The core element of managing
  stakeholders is to manage their expectations to keep them in line with the project management
  plan. To accomplish that, you need to distribute the right information to the right stakehold-
  ers at the right time by using the right communication method. The right stakeholders can be
  identified from the stakeholder register developed during project initiation. You must also per-
  form the management according to the stakeholder management strategy developed during the
  project initiation stage and communicate with the stakeholders according to the communica-
  tion management plan developed during project planning.
  So, the core question in this chapter is how to effectively manage stakeholders. In search of an
  answer, we will explore three avenues--the big picture of stakeholder management, managing
  stakeholder expectations, and distributing information.



Stakeholder Management: Big Picture
  As shown in Figure 9.1, managing stakeholders includes the following processes:
       Identify Stakeholders. This is the process of identifying all the stakeholders, posi-
       tive and negative, during the project initiation. In this process, you develop a stake-
       holder register and a stakeholder management strategy.
       Collect Requirements. As part of scope planning, this is the process of collecting
       project and product requirements that will meet the stakeholders' needs and expecta-
       tions. In this process you generate the stakeholder requirements document and the
       requirements management plan.
       Manage Stakeholder Expectations. This is the process of staying on the same page
       with the stakeholders on requirements by addressing their needs and issues.
       Distribute Information. This is the process of distributing relevant information to
       the right stakeholders at the right time by using the right methods.


              NOTE
        The processes Manage Stakeholder Expectations and Distribute Information discussed
        in this chapter belong to communication management, introduced in Chapter 4.
                                           MANAGING THE STAKES                  Chapter 9      289




         FIGURE 9.1 Big picture of managing stakeholders.

  The Identify Stakeholders process, discussed in Chapter 2, is performed during project initia-
  tion, and the Collect Requirements process, discussed in Chapter 3, is performed during pro-
  ject planning. In this chapter, we explore two other components of stakeholder management:
  managing stakeholder expectations and distributing information.



Managing Stakeholder Expectations
  Managing stakeholder expectations means communicating and working with stakeholders to
  stay on the same page with them on the project requirements by addressing their needs and
  issues as they arise. What do you really do when you manage stakeholder expectations? This is
  a three-pronged task:
    1. Containment. Monitor and keep the expectations of the stakeholders within the pro-
       ject scope and project management plan through active communication.
    2. Concerns. Address the stakeholder concerns that have not become issues yet--for
       example, anticipate problems in the near future. Addressing such concerns may
       uncover some potential risks that will need to be addressed. An issue is an item or a
       matter that is under discussion or dispute, and there are most likely opposing views
       and disagreements about it among the stakeholders.
290   Part III         EXECUTING THE PROJECT


          3.     Issues. Understand, clarify, and resolve issues raised by the stakeholders. Some of the
                 resolutions can give rise to change requests; other issues may be postponed to the next
                 project or the next phase.


                       CAUTION
                The importance of resolving issues in a timely fashion cannot be overstated. An unre-
                solved issue can grow into a major source of conflict and a delay in completion of
                project activities.



        You can see that managing stakeholders' expectations will keep them on the same page with
        you by ensuring that they understand the internal dynamics and realities of the project, such
        as risks and interdependencies. Keeping them in touch with the project reality and on the
        same page with you will increase the probability of project success. It's the responsibility of the
        project manager to manage stakeholder expectations by using the process illustrated in Figure
        9.2. Most of the items in the input and tools and techniques listed in this figure were already
        discussed in this book. Some information regarding these items and relevant to this process will
        be discussed in this section.



                       TIP
                Managing stakeholders' expectations is crucial for project success because it keeps
                their expectations in line with the project goals, objectives, and requirements in the
                project management plan. Otherwise, their definition of success will be different from
                your definition of success, and the project will fail in their eyes even if it succeeded
                according to the project management plan.

                                         MANAGING THE STAKES                       Chapter 9       291


Earlier I mentioned that managing stakeholder expectations is a three-pronged task. That was
the what of managing stakeholder expectations. But how do you perform this task? The how
of the task also has three dimensions to it:
  1. Manage stakeholders according to a strategy. This strategy is documented in the
     stakeholder management strategy that you developed in the stakeholder identification
     process during project initiation.
  2. Identify the right stakeholders to communicate with. A list of stakeholders and
     information about them is in the stakeholder register that you created during the ini-
     tiation stage when you were identifying stakeholders.
  3. Communicate with the stakeholders according to the communication management
     plan. This plan was developed during project planning. That means you are commu-
     nicating the right information at the right time to the right stakeholders by using the
     right methods.

You can use the issue log, also called the action item log, to open the issue, monitor it, resolve
it, and close it. Issues should be clearly stated, categorized, and prioritized. An action item (or
issue) log is a tool used to document and monitor actions that need to be taken or issues that
need to be resolved. This is an essential tool to ensure that important items do not fall through
the cracks of communication.
Similarly, you can maintain a change log to document the changes that are requested, have
occurred, or have been implemented during the project lifecycle.


              NOTE
        Rarely does an issue grow to become a project or a project activity. It is your respon-
        sibility to resolve issues in a timely fashion in order to maintain a constructive rela-
        tionship with stakeholders. However, the resolution may cause change requests for
        the project, which should go through the proper evaluation and approval process
        before they are implemented.


The organizational process assets that can affect managing stakeholders' expectations include
the following:
        Organizational change control procedures. These are important because some
        change requests may arise in the process of managing stakeholder expectations.
        Issue management procedures. You should comply with these procedures while
        managing stakeholder issues.
        Organizational communication requirements. These requirements must be met
        while communicating with the stakeholders.
        Information from previous projects. It's always useful to learn from the experience
        in order to do better.
292     Part III       EXECUTING THE PROJECT


           The tools and techniques that you can use in managing stakeholder expectations include the
           following:
                Management skills, including interpersonal skills. You will need these skills to
                manage change, resolve conflicts, and build trust. These skills include presentation,
                writing, and public speaking skills. These skills were discussed in Chapters 1 and 4.
                Communication methods. You will use the appropriate communication methods as
                described in the communication management plan. These methods were discussed
                in Chapter 4.
           As a result of managing stakeholder expectations, some changes can occur. For example, you
           may need to make some changes to the stakeholder management strategy in order to accom-
           modate unexpected situations and needs. Furthermore, you may find a communication method
           ineffective and want to replace it with a more effective method, which will cause an update to
           the communication management plan. You may end up identifying a new stakeholder, and
           that will require a change in the stakeholder register, and so on. Obviously, you will be updat-
           ing the issue log as the issue proceeds toward resolution. The point here is that when a change
           occurs, you should think through it and update all the documents and plans that need to be
           updated to ensure consistency after the change has been accommodated.


      STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.1
      True or False: A stakeholder is proposing something that is not within the planned scope of the
      project. The appropriate response to this proposal is to oppose it.



           You should also document your experience of managing stakeholder expectations, which
           includes causes of issues, how the issues were resolved, lessons learned, and so on. This will
           add to the organizational process assets and will be useful for upcoming projects and as a
           record through the lifecycle of the current project.
           To stay on the same page with stakeholders, it's important to distribute relevant information
           at the right time.



   Distributing Information
           Throughout the project lifecycle, you need to continually distribute relevant information to
           the right stakeholders at the right time by using appropriate methods. The information is dis-
           tributed according to the communication management plan developed during the planning
           stage and by using the process illustrated in Figure 9.3.
                                            MANAGING THE STAKES                        Chapter 9   293




        FIGURE 9.3 The Distribute Information process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


Input to Information Distribution
    The information distribution process is used to distribute information according to the com-
    munication management plan. Therefore, the information to be distributed and the commu-
    nication management plan are the obvious input items to the information distribution process.
    These and other input items are discussed here.



                TIP
         Information about project performance at status can be distributed in the form of per-
         formance reports, which should be made available before the status or performance
         evaluation meeting.



    The distributed information includes performance reports, which contain items such as the
    following:
            Performance information, including cost and schedule
            Status information
            Results from risk analysis and risk monitoring
            Any other useful information
            Current forecasts
294   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        The performance reports are generated by using a monitoring and controlling process called Report
        Performance. In addition to the communication management plan and performance reports, the
        following organizational process assets can also affect the information distribution process:
             Information and lessons learned from past projects
             Organizational policies, procedures, and guidelines for distributing information
             Templates to facilitate information distribution
        With this input in place, you use some tools, such as communication technology, to generate
        the output of this process--that is, to distribute the information.


   Tools and Techniques for Information Distribution
        Communication skills are necessary for successful information distribution. This and other tools
        and techniques for information distribution are discussed in the following paragraphs.
        Communication skills. Communication is the exchange of information, so communication
        skills are a necessary requirement for information distribution. Communication skills, an essen-
        tial part of general management skills, are used to ensure the following:
             The right stakeholders get the right information at the right time.
             The communication requirements and expectations of stakeholders are properly
             managed.
        As discussed in Chapter 8, the communication line has two ends. There is a sender on one end
        and a receiver on the other. Both the sender and the receiver need to have communication skills.
        The sender has the following responsibilities:
             Ensure that the information is clear and complete.
             Confirm that the information is received and properly understood.
        The receiver has the following responsibilities:
             The information is received in its entirety.
             The information is correctly understood.
        So, the success of information distribution depends on both the sender and the receiver. Com-
        munication has two flavors in each of the following dimensions:
             Media. These flavors are writing and speaking on the sender's end and reading and
             listening on the receiver's end.
             Place. These flavors are internal to the project--that is, within the project--and
             external to the project--that is, communicated to entities external to the project,
             such as the customer, the media, and the public.
             Format. These flavors are formal, such as reports and briefings, and informal, such
             as memos and ad hoc conversation.
                                           MANAGING THE STAKES                     Chapter 9      295


          Hierarchy. A horizontal hierarchy means communication among peers, whereas ver-
          tical means communication between different levels of the organizational hierarchy--
          for example, a manager communicating to the team that reports to the manager.
     The information that needs to be communicated also needs to be gathered, stored, and
     retrieved.
     Information distribution methods. The information can be distributed in a number of ways
     that fall into the following two categories:
          Synchronous. Both the sender and the receiver have to be present at the same time,
          such as at face-to-face project meetings and teleconferencing.
          Asynchronous. The sender and receiver don't have to be present at the same time,
          such as with written paper or electronic documents, online bulletin boards, e-mail,
          and the World Wide Web in general.
     The communication methods and models were discussed in Chapter 8.
     Information distribution tools. You can use one or more appropriate tools to distribute infor-
     mation. These sets of tools include the following:
             Document format. Hard copy or electronic.
             Messages. E-mail, fax, voicemail, Internet bulletin boards, blogs.
             Meetings. Face-to-face meetings, video conferences, and teleconferences.
             Management tools. Project scheduling tools.
     You use these tools and techniques to generate the output of the information distribution
     process.


 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.2
 The Distribute Information process uses performance reports as an input. Which process do
 these reports come from?




Output of Information Distribution
     The output of the information distribution process is, well, the distribution of information.
     This distribution (or communication) of information falls into two categories:
          Formal distribution. This distribution refers to communicating the information as
          planned, such as regular status and progress information updates at scheduled times,
          such as once a week every Wednesday.
          Informal distribution. This refers to the communication of information on an as-
          needed basis. For example, the project sponsor can ask you for information that is
          not part of the regular schedule of distributing information.
296   Part III      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


        The process of distributing information will create some items that can be added as a record
        to the organizational process assets. Here are some examples:
             Project reports and status reports
             Stakeholder notifications about resolved issues and approved changes
             Project presentations
             Project records, such as memos, meeting minutes, and project files, such as plans and
             schedules
             Feedback from stakeholders
             Lessons learned
        The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
             Managing stakeholder expectations through distributing information is crucial to the
             success of the project.
             Managing stakeholder expectations includes keeping those expectations in line with

             to resolve issues as they arise.

   Summary
        It is crucial to the success of the project that stakeholder expectations be managed through dis-
        tribution of the right information to the right stakeholders at the right time by using the right
        communication methods. Processes of managing stakeholder expectations and distributing
        information are called Manage Stakeholder Expectations and Distribute Information, and they
        belong to communication management. The communication management plan, a part of the
        project management plan, and performance reports are the major input items to the Distrib-
        ute Information process. The information can be distributed by using various methods, such
        as reports and presentations. The communication management plan and stakeholder manage-
        ment strategy are major inputs to managing stakeholder expectations. Management and inter-
        personal skills are crucial to successfully managing stakeholder expectations.
        Performance reports, a major input to the Distribute Information process, come from moni-
        toring and controlling the project, which is the subject of the next part of this book.

Exam's Eye View
Comprehend

 Managing stakeholders includes identifying stakeholders, collecting requirements from the
    stakeholders, managing stakeholder expectations, and distributing information to the stake-
    holders.

 Resolving issues in a timely fashion helps maintain a constructive relationship with the
    stakeholders.

 The communication management plan and performance reports are the major input items to
    the Distribute Information process.

 The communication management plan and stakeholder management strategy are major inputs
    to managing stakeholder expectations.

Look Out

 Managing stakeholder expectations is crucial to the success of the project by keeping these
    expectations in line with the project management plan.

 Unresolved issues can grow to become a source of conflict.
 Communication methods are the tools used in both the Distribute Information and Manage
    Stakeholder Expectations processes.

 The project management plan is used as an input to both distributing information and manag-
    ing stakeholder expectations because it contains the communication management plan.

Memorize

 Distributing the right information to the right stakeholders at the right time by using the right
    communication methods helps manage stakeholder expectations.

 Performance reports are important, but they are not the only way to distribute information to
    stakeholders.

 Performance reports, input to the Distribute Information process, come from monitoring and
    controlling the project.

 The process of distributing information significantly adds to the organizational process assets
    in the form of project reports, status reports, project presentations, stakeholder notifications,
    project records, and lessons learned.

PART
       IV Monitoring and
       Controlling the Project
      ou need to continually monitor and control your project. In general, monitor-
Y     ing means watching the course, and controlling means taking action to either
stay the course or change the wrong course. Applied to project management, you
monitor the project by activities such as making performance measurements to
ensure that it is on the track set by the project management plan, and you control
the project to keep it on track and to bring it back on track if it falls off. The core
of monitoring and controlling the project includes collecting the work performance
information, the raw data, from the project execution and analyzing it for perfor-
mance, which includes comparing it to the accepted performance baseline that con-
sists of the scope baseline, schedule baseline, and cost baseline. This comparison
generates the performance measurements, which may generate some change
requests. The change requests must be processed through an integrated change
control system for approval, and only the approved changes should be imple-
mented. The performance measurements may also expose some previously unde-
tected risks.

                              12. You also must understand the impact of a
                              change across the project--for example, the triple
                              constraint covered in Chapter 12.
Introduction
  You need to continually monitor and control your project--that is, monitor and control the
  project activities against the project management plan and project performance baseline. This
  is because executing a project means executing the project work according to the project man-
  agement plan based on some baselines, such as a schedule baseline, a scope baseline, and a cost
  baseline. In general, monitoring means watching the course, and controlling means taking
  action to either stay the course or change the wrong course. You monitor the project by gen-
  erating, collecting, and distributing information about project performance against the base-
  lines. Performance reports are used to monitor and control the project work. Deviations of
  performance results from the plan might indicate that some changes to the original project plan
  are required. Other change requests might come from stakeholders, such as expanding the
  project scope by adding new requirements. You control all these changes by influencing the fac-
  tors that generate them, processing them through a system called the integrated change control
  system that contains a process called the Perform Integrated Change Control process, evaluating
  their impact across the project, and ensuring the implementation of the approved change
  requests.
  In addition to the schedule activities that need to be executed, the project management plan
  also contains a list of risks and the risk management plan. You monitor the risks by looking
  out for the risk triggers (the alerts that tell you a risk has occurred or is about to occur) for the
  already identified risks and by identifying new risks as the project progresses. You control the
  risks by executing the risk response plan and taking corrective and preventive actions. Quality
  is an integrated part of any project. Therefore, monitoring and controlling the project work
  includes controlling the quality. All these aspects of the project are monitored and controlled
  by using two high-level processes that belong to integration management: the Monitor and
  Control Project Work process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process. This also
  includes administering the procurement part of the project, which is another high-level process
  by its virtue.
  So, in this chapter, we will explore the big picture of monitoring and controlling the project
  while venturing through three avenues: monitoring and controlling project work, performing
  integrated change control, and administering procurements.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT WORK                                       Chapter 10      305


Monitoring and Controlling the
Project: Big Picture
    You monitor and control your project by monitoring and controlling the project performance,
    changes, and risks. Monitoring includes measuring project performance, collecting informa-
    tion about project performance, and evaluating performance information to see the trends.
    Continuous monitoring helps the project management team identify the areas that need to be
    controlled closely by, for example, taking corrective or preventive actions.


                NOTE
          Monitoring and controlling does not start only after the project starts execution.
          Rather, the project needs to be monitored and controlled all the way from initiation
          through closing.



    A project is monitored and controlled using the Monitor and Control Project Work and Per-
    form Integrated Change Control processes, which are high-level processes performed by exe-
    cuting more specific processes, such as cost control, schedule control, and scope control, as
    shown in Figure 10.1. All these processes are in the monitoring and controlling process group
    except the Direct and Manage Project Execution process, which belongs to the executing group.
    As illustrated in Figure 10.1, work performance information generated by the Direct and Man-
    age Project Execution process is used by most of the monitoring and controlling processes.
    The Control Scope, Control Schedule, and Control Cost processes analyze this information to
    generate work performance measurements, which are used by some other processes, such as
    Perform Quality Control and Report Performance. The Report Performance process generates
    performance reports, which are used by the Monitor and Control Risks and Administer Pro-
    curements processes. One obvious output of most of these processes is the change requests,
    including recommended corrective and preventive actions, which go through the Perform Inte-
    grated Change Control process for approval. If approved, the execution of these actions and
    changes is managed using Direct and Manage Project Execution, a process in the executing
    process group.

           FIGURE 10.1 Big picture of the monitoring and controlling process group.


       In the monitoring and controlling process group, the Monitor and Control Project Work
       process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process belong to project integration
       management.



   Monitoring and Controlling Project Work
       Monitor and Control Project Work is a high-level process for monitoring and controlling pro-
       ject progress to ensure that the project is on its way to meet its objectives laid out in the pro-
       ject management plan. Some of the major tasks performed during this process include the
       following:
            Monitoring project performance by measuring it against the project management
            plan in terms of parameters such as cost, schedule, and scope
            Monitoring the project by collecting information to support status reporting,
            progress measurement, and predictions
            Evaluating performance to determine whether it needs to be controlled by taking
            corrective or preventive actions
            Monitoring risks by tracking and analyzing the already identified project risks and
            by identifying new risks

       Controlling risks by managing the execution of risk response plans when the risks
       occur
       Maintaining an accurate and timely information base regarding the project as it pro-
       gresses
       Monitoring and controlling changes and monitoring the implementation of
       approved changes
       Monitoring and controlling quality and administering procurements
  The Monitor and Control Project Work process is illustrated in Figure 10.2. The major input
  to this process is the performance reports, which are compared to the performance baseline in
  the project management plan. From this comparison, some changes may be requested as an
  output of this process, which may include recommendations for corrective actions, preventive
  actions, and defect repairs. The performance report consists of current project status, accom-
  plishments, scheduled activities, forecasts, and current issues. This report is generated by using
  the Report Performance process discussed in Chapter 11.




      FIGURE 10.2 The Monitor and Control Project Work process: input, tools and techniques, and
                      output.

  Enterprise environmental factors used as input to this process include project management
  information systems, work authorization systems of the performing organization, risk tolerance
  level of the stakeholders, and industry and government standards. The organizational process
  assets that can be used to perform this process include financial control procedures, the com-
  pany's communication requirements, management procedures regarding issues and defects, risk
  control procedures, process measurement database, and lessons learned from past projects.
  As a result of performing this process, you may need to update some parts of the project man-
  agement plan, such as scope baseline, schedule baseline, cost baseline, schedule management
  plan, cost management plan, and quality management plan. These updates often result from
  change requests made by various monitoring and controlling processes.

                       CAUTION
                Monitor and Control Project Work is a high-level umbrella process. Most of its tasks
                are actually performed by using the lower-level, more specific processes discussed in
                this and upcoming chapters.



      STUDY CHECKPOINT 10.2
      Name an element for which the project management plan is used to perform the Monitor and
      Control Project Work process.



          As mentioned earlier, change requests arising from monitoring and controlling the project or
          originating from any other source, such as the stakeholders, must be processed through the inte-
          grated change control process formally called Perform Integrated Change Control. Actually,
          one of the important tasks of monitoring and controlling the project is to influence the factors
          that tend to circumvent the integrated change control process and ensure that only those
          changes that are approved through the integrated change control process are implemented.



   Integrating Change Control
          The Perform Integrated Change Control process is used to manage changes to the project from
          project initiation through project closure. A project rarely runs exactly according to the project
          management plan, and therefore changes will inevitably appear. Change requests can come
          from evaluating project performance to bring the project in line with the project management
          plan, or they can come from other sources, such as the stakeholders. Regardless of where they
          originate from, all changes need to be managed (monitored and controlled), which includes
          getting the changes rejected or approved, seeing the approved changes implemented, and
          changing the affected plans accordingly. You, the project manager, must manage changes proac-
          tively, which includes the following activities:
               Identify changes. Identify a change that has occurred and receive a change request.
               Process changes. Get the requested changes approved or rejected. Depending on
               the project and the performing organization, the authority to determine whether a
               change is eventually rejected or approved might lie with the project manager, a cus-
               tomer, a sponsor, or a committee.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT WORK                                       Chapter 10       309


       Manage approved changes. Monitor and control the flow of approved changes,
       which includes:
        Making sure they are implemented.
        Maintaining the integrity of the project baseline (cost, schedule, and scope) by
          updating it to incorporate the approved changes.
        Coordinating changes and their impact across the project and updating the
          affected documentation. For example, an approved schedule change might
          impact cost, quality, risk, and staffing.
        Documenting the complete impact of the changes across the project.
       Protect the integrity of the process. Make sure that only the approved changes are
       implemented.



               TIP
        Especially in a startup organization, quite often you will notice changes making their
        way through the back door--for example, a product manager talking to an engineer
        directly and introducing changes. Do not consider yourself an opponent of changes
        by default, but you do need to manage changes and make sure each change goes
        through the integrated change control process. So, when it comes to changes, the
        key word is control, and not necessarily oppose.



  At this point, you can ask a question: Who will actually approve or reject a change request?
  The answer to this question will be determined during project planning. Depending on the
  project and the performing organization, different possibilities exist. For example, there will be
  a category of change requests that the project manager may be authorized to approve or dis-
  approve. Other types of changes may be reviewed by a change control board (CCB) that may
  consist of individuals from upper management and other stakeholders. The roles and respon-
  sibilities of the CCB should be clearly spelled out in the change control and configuration
  control procedures.
  Figure 10.3 shows the integrated change control process. The change requests that need to be
  approved are the obvious input to this process.

                           output.


   Input to Integrated Change Control
       Each requested change and recommended action must be processed through the integrated
       change control process. The approved changes have their effects on the project management
       plan, and therefore the plan needs to be updated accordingly. Following are the input items to
       the integrated change control process.
       Project management plan. This is needed to help identify the changes and make updates after
       the changes have been approved.
       Work performance information. The performance information is input because performance
       deviations from the plan will trigger change requests or recommended corrective or preventive
       actions to improve the situation.
       Change requests. This is the obvious input. A requested change goes through an approval
       process in which it can be approved, rejected, or delayed. These change requests come from var-
       ious monitoring and controlling processes or from the stakeholders. The change requests may
       include the following types of recommendations:
            Recommended corrective actions
            Recommended preventive actions
            Recommended defect repairs
       These recommendations might arise from performance evaluations, and they are the output of
       various processes discussed in this chapter.
       Enterprise environmental factors. The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the
       integrated change control process include the project management information system. This is
       a collection of tools and techniques (manual and automated) used to gather, integrate, and dis-
       seminate the output of project management processes. This system is used to facilitate processes
       from the initiation stage all the way to the closing stage. Microsoft Project, a product that lets

   you create a project schedule, is an example of such a tool. Another example of a component
   of the project management information system could be a document management system to
   create, review, change, and approve documents to facilitate the change control procedure.
   The project management information system may include scheduling software, an informa-
   tion collection and distribution system, a configuration management system, and web inter-
   faces to other automated information systems. A configuration management system can be used
   to monitor and control changes, and it may have some knowledge base that can also be used.
   Organizational process assets. The following items in the organizational process assets can
   influence the change control process.
        Organizational procedures. Your organization may have proper procedures related
        to change control--for example, how to modify documents, such as plans; how to
        process (evaluate, approve, or reject) changes; and how to implement the approved
        changes.
        Measurements. A database of process measurements.
        Project files. Project files from previous projects may be a useful input to the change
        control process in order to learn from the past.
        Change knowledge base. This is the knowledge base that can be used for configura-
        tion management, such as official company standards and policies and project
        documents.
   So what tools and techniques are available to process these requests and recommendations?
   Read on....


Tools and Techniques for Integrated Change Control
   Expert judgment and meetings are the two main tools for the integrated change control process.
   You can also use the technical expertise of the stakeholders to evaluate change requests. The
   project management team can also use the experts on the change control board to evaluate
   change requests and to make approval or rejection decisions about change requests. If there is
   a formal change control board for the project, it will conduct meetings to review, evaluate,
   approve, reject, or delay the change requests.
   Rejection or approval of the change request is an obvious output of the integrated change con-
   trol process.


Output from Integrated Change Control
   The changes that are processed through the integrated change control process will either be
   rejected or approved. As a result of the approved changes, the project management plan might
   need to be updated. Accordingly, following are the output items of the integrated change con-
   trol process.
312     Part IV         MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


          Change request status updates. The items processed through the integrated change control
          process will ultimately be either approved or rejected. In the meantime, each change request
          must have some status that can be reported. Here are some examples of status:
                     Being processed
                     Approved
                     Rejected
                     Implemented
                     Implementation validated
          Document updates. As a result of approved changes, items such as the project management
          plan and the project scope statement might need to be updated. The baselines in the project

      Name a process in this process group that takes change requests as an input.




   Administering Procurements
          Administering procurements is the process of monitoring and controlling the procurement part
          of the project. It's a three-pronged process:
             1. Manage procurement-specific relationships
             2. Monitor the performance of the procurement part of the project
             3. Monitor and control the procurement-related changes

          Administering procurements has a two-pronged goal: The seller performance meets the pro-
          curement requirements, and the buyer meets its agreed-upon contractual obligations. Depend-
          ing on the size and complexity of the project and the structure of the performing organization,
          procurement administration may be treated by a group outside of the project organization. But
          you will still need to integrate this function with the project and act as a communicator and
          coordinator to ensure that this function is performed smoothly without adversely affecting the
          other aspects of the project. The project management processes that can be used for adminis-
          tering procurements include Perform Quality Control, Report Performance, Direct and Man-
          age Project Execution, Monitor and Control Risks, and Perform Integrated Change Control.
          In that sense, it's a high-level process illustrated in Figure 10.4. The major input items are the
          procurement management plan, work performance information, performance reports, contracts,
          and approved change requests. The tools and techniques used in administering procurements
          include the contract change control system, the payment system, claims administration, and
          inspections and audits. Administering procurements may generate change requests.

Name an input item that is common to all three processes: Monitor and Control Project Work,
Perform Integrated Change Control, and Administer Procurements.



    The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
          Work performance reports are compared to the project management plan to monitor
          and control the project work and to make recommendations for changes accordingly.
          All change requests must go through the integrated change control process, and only
          the approved changes should be implemented.
          Administering procurements is a high-level process that can be executed by per-
          forming multiple project management processes, such as Perform Quality Control,
          Report Performance, Direct and Manage Project Execution, Monitor and Control
          Risks, and Perform Integrated Change Control.



Summary
    You need to monitor and control your project throughout its lifecycle, which includes moni-
    toring and controlling project work, including procurements, performance, changes, quality,
    and risks. All these aspects of the project are monitored and controlled by using two high-level
    processes that belong to integration management: Monitor and Control Project Work and Per-
    form Integrated Change Control. This also includes administering the procurement part of
    the project, which is another high-level process by its virtue. The Monitor and Control Pro-
    ject Work process takes performance reports as input, compares them to the planned perfor-
    mance (baselines) in the project management plan, and, if needed, makes recommendations
    for changes to bring the project back on track. The change requests from this and other
314   Part IV        MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       processes are run through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Only the change
       requests approved through this process are implemented. Project procurements are adminis-
       tered by using many processes, including Perform Quality Control, Report Performance, Direct
       and Manage Project Execution, Monitor and Control Risks, and Perform Integrated Change
       Control.
       We discussed three high-level processes in this chapter, out of which two belong to project inte-
       gration management. These processes are actually performed by executing a number of low-
       level processes. Quality control and risk control are two of these low-level processes, and they
       are discussed in the next chapter.


       Exam's Eye View
         Comprehend

          You monitor and control the project by monitoring and controlling project work, performance,
             changes, quality, and risks.

          All the individual control processes, such as risk control and quality control, can generate
             change requests and recommended actions, which must be processed through the integrated
             change control process, in which each of these requests and recommendations will either be
             rejected or approved.

          The approved change requests and recommendations for actions will be processed through the
             Direct and Manage Project Execution process for implementation.

          The Monitor and Control Project Work process and the Perform Integrated Change Control
             process belong to project integration management.

         Look Out

          One of the important tasks of monitoring and controlling the project is to influence the factors
             that tend to circumvent the integrated change control process and ensure that only those
             changes are implemented that are approved through the integrated change control process.

          The performance reports generated by the Report Performance process are an input to the
             Monitor and Control Project Work process.

          Most of the processes of the monitoring and controlling group generate change requests,
             which must be approved or rejected by performing the integrated change control process.

          Approved change requests must be implemented by performing the Direct and Manage
             Project Execution process.

   Memorize

    Work performance is an input to the Perform Integrated Change Control process and the
      Administer Procurements process.

    Performance reports are an input to the Monitor and Control Project Work process and the
      Administer Procurements process.

    Change requests are an output of Monitor and Control Project Work process and the
      Administer Procurements process.

    The Perform Integrated Change Control process generates updates to change requests as an
      output--that is, it approves, rejects, or postpones a change request.

                            and Control Risks. You should also be familiar with
                            risk response techniques, such as acceptance, trans-
                            ference, and mitigation, discussed in Chapter 6.
Introduction
  At any given point in time, the project is in a certain state called the project status, and the dif-
  ference between two states in time is called the project progress. Your success as a project man-
  ager is directly proportional to successfully communicating the project performance, including
  the project status and progress, to the right stakeholders at the right time by using the right
  methods. It is not a matter of chance that I have used the two words communication and per-
  formance in the same sentence; they are intimately connected and highly correlated concepts in
  project management. Communicating performance to the right stakeholders at the right time
  by using the right methods is called performance reporting, or reporting for brevity. Effective
  reporting is the oxygen for a project. Among many other benefits, reporting helps control pro-
  ject risks--the enemies within.
  Quality is an integrated part of any project. Therefore, monitoring and controlling project work
  includes controlling quality. If you do not monitor and control risks, the quality will be affected.
  You monitor the risks by looking out for risk triggers (alerts that tell you a risk has occurred or
  is about to occur) for the already identified risks and by identifying new risks as the project pro-
  gresses. You control risks by executing the risk response plan and taking corrective and pre-
  ventive actions.
  Therefore, the core question in this chapter is, how do you monitor and control performance
  communication, quality, and risk? In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues in
  the area of monitoring and controlling: controlling quality, controlling risks, and reporting
  performance.



Controlling Quality
  Quality is controlled by using the Perform Quality Control process, a process of monitoring
  and recording results from the execution of projects, including quality activities. The goal is to
  evaluate quality performance and recommend necessary changes. The quality control process
  in the context of a big picture is shown in Figure 11.1, which relates the quality management
  processes to one another and also to integrated change control and project execution.

        FIGURE 11.1 Quality management in the big picture.


STUDY CHECKPOINT 11.1
 A. Which quality process generates quality control measurements?
 B. Which quality process uses quality control measurements?



   Controlling quality involves monitoring specific results to determine whether they comply with
   the planned quality standards, which include project processes and product goals, and control-
   ling the results by taking actions to eliminate unsatisfactory performance. In other words, the
   Perform Quality Control process is used to monitor and control quality by accomplishing the
   following goals:
         Monitor specific project results, such as cost performance and schedule performance,
         to determine whether they comply with the planned quality standards, which
         include project processes and product goals.
         Identify ways to eliminate the causes of unsatisfactory performance.
322   Part IV        MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       The results under scrutiny include both deliverables and performance measurements by the pro-
       ject management team. Quality control is performed throughout the project. While dealing
       with quality control, you must be able to distinguish between the two terms in each of the fol-
       lowing pairs:
            Prevention and inspection
             Prevention is a direction to perform an activity that will keep an error from
               entering the product and the process.
             Inspection is a technique to examine whether an activity, component, product,
               result, or service complies with planned requirements. The goal of inspection is
               to ensure that errors do not reach the customer.
            Attribute sampling and variable sampling
             Attribute sampling is a technique to determine whether a result conforms to the
               specified standard.
             Variable sampling is a technique to rate a result on a continuous scale that mea-
               sures the degree of conformity.
            Common cause and special cause
             Common cause is a source of variation that is inherent to the system and is pre-
               dictable. Such variations are also called normal variations, and the common
               causes for them are also called random causes.
             Special cause is a source of variation that is not inherent to the system and is
               removable. It can be assigned to a defect in the system.
            Control limits and tolerances
                  Control limits is the area occupied by three standard deviations on either side of
                  the central line or the mean of a normal distribution of data plotted on a control
                  chart that reflects the expected variation of the data. If the results fall within the
                  control limits, they are within the quality control.
                  Tolerance is the range within which a result is acceptable if it falls within the
                  limits of the range.
       Figure 11.2 shows the Perform Quality Control process.



                      TIP
                QC can be performed by the QA department or by the QC department if the perform-
                ing organization has one. Nevertheless, the project management team should have a
                working knowledge of statistical aspects of quality control, such as sampling and
                probability. This will help evaluate the QC output.

        FIGURE 11.2 The Perform Quality Control process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


Input to Quality Control
    The goal of quality control is to ensure that the performance from the project execution meets
    the planned quality standards. Therefore, the outputs from project execution and from quality
    planning are the obvious inputs to the Perform Quality Control process. These and other
    input items are discussed here:
         Quality planning output. The following items from the output of the quality plan-
         ning process, discussed in Chapter 6, are the input to the Perform Quality Control
         process:
          The quality management plan lets you know what quality standards are supposed
             to be implemented and how.
          Quality metrics specify which quality features to monitor and how to measure
             them.
          Quality checklists show which quality steps need to be performed.
         Output from the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. The following
         items from the output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process, dis-
         cussed in Chapter 7, are input to the Perform Quality Control process:
          A list of deliverables from the project execution to ensure that all the required
             deliverables are produced before project completion
          Work performance measurements to monitor performance. These measurements
             are made from the work performance information received from project execu-
             tion by processing it through scope control, schedule control, and cost control.
         Approved change requests. You need this list to ensure that all the approved
         changes are implemented in a timely fashion. The list of approved change requests
         also includes modifications, such as revised work methods and a revised schedule.
         Organizational process assets. These include quality policies and procedures, work
         guidelines, change control procedures, communication policies, and quality-related
         historical data. These items will be used in the quality control process.

      Project deliverables are an input to which quality process?



           Quality control is a very involved process and has a plethora of tools and techniques, discussed
           next.


   Tools and Techniques for Quality Control
           The tools and techniques used for quality control include inspection, defect repair reviews, and
           the so-called seven basic tools of quality.


           Seven Basic Tools of Quality
           Table 11.1 shows the seven kinds of charts and diagrams used in quality control, also known
           as the seven basic tools of quality. These tools are further described in the following list.

           Flowcharts
           A flowchart is a diagram that depicts inputs, actions, and outputs of one or more processes in
           a system. Flowcharts, commonly used in many disciplines of knowledge, show the activities,
           decision points, and order of processing. They help to understand how a problem occurs. You
           can also use flowcharts to anticipate what quality problems might be, where they might occur,
           and how you might deal with them.

 Run Charts
 A run chart is a chart that shows the history and pattern of variations. Therefore, run charts
 are used to perform trend analysis, which is the science of predicting future performance based
 on past results. In quality control, trend analysis can be used to predict such things as the num-
 ber of defects and the cost to repair them. You can use the results of trend analysis to recom-
 mend preventive actions if needed. Run charts or trend analysis can be used to monitor cost
 performance, schedule performance, and technical performance. An example of technical
 performance is how many defects have been identified and how many of them remained
 unrepaired.


 Scatter Diagrams
 A scatter diagram is used to show the pattern of the relationship between two variables--an
 independent variable and another variable that depends on the independent variable. The
 dependent variable is plotted corresponding to the independent variable. For example, a vari-
 able representing a cause can be the independent variable, and a variable representing the
 effect can be a dependent variable. The closer the data points are to a diagonal line, the stronger
 the relationship (called the correlation) is between the two variables.


 Histograms
 A histogram is a bar chart that shows a distribution of variables. Each bar can represent an
 attribute, such as defects due to a specific cause, and its height can represent the frequency of
 the attribute, such as number of defects. This tool helps to identify and rate the causes of
 defects. You also use a histogram to identify and illustrate the most common cause of a prob-
 lem, such as a cause behind defects.
 You might wonder how defects can be repaired efficiently. Pareto diagrams, which are exam-
 ples of histograms, have the answer for you.

 Pareto Diagrams
 A Pareto diagram is used to rank the importance of each error (problem) based on the fre-
 quency of its occurrence over time in the form of defects. A defect is an imperfection or defi-
 ciency that keeps a component from meeting its requirements or specifications. A defect is
 caused by an error (problem) and can be repaired by fixing the error. An error in a product can
 give rise to multiple defects, and by fixing the error you repair all the defects caused by that
 error.
 However, all errors are not equal. Some errors cause more defects than others. According to
 Pareto's law, which is also known as the 80/20 rule, 80 percent of project defects are caused by
 20 percent of errors (or types of errors). Qualitatively, it means that most defects are caused by
 a small set of errors. The Pareto diagram lets you rank errors based on the frequency of defects
 they cause. You begin by having the error that causes most of the defects fixed and make your
 way to other errors that cause lesser numbers of defects. This way, the efforts of the project
 team are optimized: You get the maximum number of defects repaired with minimal effort.

       The advantages of a Pareto diagram are twofold:
              It ranks errors according to the frequency of defects they cause.
              It optimizes efforts to repair the defects by working on the errors that cause most of
              the defects.
       As an example, Table 11.2 presents data on the frequency of defects caused by certain errors.
       The data is displayed in Figure 11.3 in form of a Pareto diagram. In this example, 200 defects
       are caused by seven errors, and Error A alone causes 75 defects, which is 37.5 percent of all the
       defects. Similarly, you can understand the impact of other errors by looking at Table 11.2 and
       Figure 11.3. The Pareto diagram tells you that you should address Error A first, Error B sec-
       ond, and so on.

                     NOTE
              Pareto's law, in its original form, was presented as an economic theory by Vilfredo
              Pareto, a 19th-century Italian economist, and it states that 80 percent of income is
              earned by 20 percent of the population. Since then, it has been applied to other
              fields, such as project management.



       You might ask: How many defects are acceptable? To find an answer to this question, you need
       to understand another tool, called the control chart.

     FIGURE 11.3 An example of a Pareto diagram.


 Control Charts
 Control charts are used to monitor whether the variance of a specified variable is within the
 acceptable limits dictated by quality control. A variance is a measurable deviation in the value
 of a project variable, such as cost from a known baseline or expected value. This is a way to
 monitor the deviations and determine whether the corresponding variable is in or out of con-
 trol. The values are taken at different times to measure the behavior of a variable over time.
 The mean value in the control chart represents the expected value, and a predetermined spread
 from the mean value (usually 3 ) is used to define the limits within which an acceptable value
 can fall.
 Control charts can be used to monitor the values of any type of output variables. To illustrate
 their main features, consider the example of a control chart shown in Figure 11.4. In this exam-
 ple, assume that a manufacturer produces 100 units of a product each day, and it is expected
 that 95 out of 100 units should have no defect--that is, the expected number of defective units
 is equal to five. The control limits are set to 3. In other words, 95 units out of 100 must be
 correct, give or take three. That puts the lower limit at 92 and the upper limit at 98. Crossing
 the lower limits is not acceptable to the customer, and crossing the upper limits might require
 an unjustifiable cost.
 Controlling quality includes dealing with defects and problems that cause them. So, studying
 causes of a problem is critical to quality control.

               FIGURE 11.4 An example of a control chart.


       Cause and Effect Diagram
       A cause and effect diagram is used to explore all the potential causes (inputs) that result in a
       single effect (output), such as a problem or a defect. This type of diagram is the brainchild of
       Kaoru Ishikawa, who pioneered quality management processes in the Kawasaki shipyards, and
       therefore these diagrams are also called Ishikawa diagrams. Due to the shape of these dia-
       grams, they are also known as fishbone diagrams. To construct and use cause and effect dia-
       grams effectively, perform the following simple steps:
          1. Identify the problem. Write down the problem in a box drawn on the right side of a
             large sheet of paper. This represents the head of the fish. Starting from the box, draw
             a horizontal line across the paper. This represents the spine of the fish.
          2. Identify the possible areas of causes. Identify the areas or factors from where the
             potential causes of the problem might come. Environment, people, materials, mea-
             surements, and methods are some examples of areas (factors) of causes. For each factor
             relevant to the problem under study, draw a line off the spine and label it with the
             name of the factor. These lines represent the fish bones.
          3. Identify the possible causes. For each factor, identify possible causes. Represent each
             possible cause with a line coming off the bone that represents the corresponding factor.
          4. Analyze the diagram. Analyzing the diagram includes narrowing down the most
             likely causes and investigating them further.

       Figure 11.5 shows an example of a cause and effect diagram. The problem in this example is
       the delay in the release of a website. The factors considered are environment, methods, people,
       and time. Of course, the diagram is incomplete in the sense that more factors and related causes
       can be explored, and causes for each factor can be explored further. But you get the point.

     FIGURE 11.5 An example of a cause and effect diagram: Explore the causes for a delay in a web-
                     site release.



              TIP
       While constructing the cause and effect diagram, you can use the brainstorming method
       for identifying the potential factors of causes and the potential causes for each factor.



 A cause and effect diagram offers a structured way to think through all possible causes of a
 problem. You can use these diagrams to carry out a thorough analysis of a problematic situa-
 tion. This kind of analysis is useful in complex situations when, to discover the real causes, you
 need to explore all the potential causes and not just the obvious ones.
 In addition to the seven quality tools we have discussed, there are some other tools that you
 can use for quality control.


 Other Quality Control Tools
 In addition to the seven quality tools, the following tools can also be used for controlling
 quality:
      Statistical sampling. Statistical sampling involves randomly selecting a part of the
      population for study. In quality control, you can select a subset of features for inspec-
      tion. This can save a substantial amount of resources.
      Inspection. This is a technique to examine whether an activity, component, product,
      service, or result conforms to specific requirements. Inspections can be conducted at
      various levels of project execution. For example, you can inspect the results of a
330     Part IV       MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


                single activity, or you can inspect the final product of the project. Nevertheless,
                inspection generally includes measurements. There are various forms of inspections,
                such as reviews, peer reviews, audits, and walkthroughs.
                Review of approved defect repairs. This review is conducted by the QC department
                or body to ensure that the defects approved for repair are actually repaired to bring the
                defective product, service, or results in conformance with the specified requirements.

      STUDY CHECKPOINT 11.3
      What other process uses the tools and techniques used in the Perform Quality Control process?


          These tools can be used to make quality control measurements, which in turn can be used to
          recommend preventive and corrective actions: the output of quality control.


   Output of Quality Control
          The quality control measurements and the recommendations based on those measurements
          are the obvious output items of the quality control process. These and other output items are
          discussed in the following list.
          Quality control measurements. These are the results of the QC activities and are fed back to
          the QA process. They are also used to make recommendations for corrective and preventive
          actions. These measurements function as feedback for the quality assurance process.
          Validated items. These are the items that have been validated through the QC process:
                Validated defect repair. Once a component has been repaired from a defect, it needs
                to be inspected so the repair will be accepted or rejected. The rejected items might
                need to be repaired again. The accepted repair is a validated defect repair.
                Validated deliverables. This refers to verifying the correctness of project deliver-
                ables. A deliverable accepted through a QC process is a validated deliverable.
          Change requests. The quality control process can generate the following kinds of change requests:
                Recommended corrective actions. These actions are recommended as a result of
                the QC process to meet the established quality goals.
                Recommended preventive actions. These actions are recommended as a result of
                the QC process to avoid future failure to meet the established quality goals.
                Recommended defect repair. A defect is an imperfection or deficiency that keeps a
                component from meeting its requirements or specifications. Such a component
                needs to be repaired or replaced.
                Other change requests. These requests may arise from recommended corrective or
                preventive actions that might require changes to the project, or they may be needed
                independent of these recommendations. The changes are requested and processed
                through the integrated change control process.

    Updates. The quality control process might generate updates to the following items:
          Organizational process assets. The completed checklists become part of the project
          record. Furthermore, you can update the lessons-learned database and documenta-
          tion. These might include the causes of variances, the reasons for corrective and pre-
          ventive actions, and the actions that worked and those that did not.
          Project management plan. The project management plan should be updated to
          reflect changes to the quality management plan resulting from the QC process. The
          quality baseline might need to be updated to reflect changes to the quality plan
          resulting from the QC process.

corresponding to each activity listed in the first column.

    Let's say you are doing a fine job in controlling quality. However, if an unidentified risk sud-
    denly strikes or an already identified risk event has occurred but the planned response is not
    being implemented in a timely fashion, quality is one of the possible victims. So controlling
    risks is as important as controlling quality.



Monitoring and Controlling Risks
    Risks are monitored and controlled by using the Monitor and Control Risks process. This
    process is shown in Figure 11.6, which presents the big picture of risk management.
332   Part IV       MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT




      FIGURE 11.6 Monitoring and controlling risks in the big picture of risk management.

       You must actively monitor the identified risks and identify and respond to new risks as they
       appear. The risk monitoring and controlling process is used to monitor and control risks and
       includes the following goals:
            Tracking identified risks
            Monitoring residual risks (risks that remain after risk responses have been
            implemented)
            Identifying new risks and preparing responses for them
            Executing the risk plan and evaluating its effectiveness
       However, the risk situation can change with time. Therefore, monitoring and controlling risks
       also includes monitoring risk dynamics, which involves the following:
            Ensuring that the project execution is conforming to the risk management policies
            and procedures.
            Determining whether the project assumptions are still valid. If an assumption
            becomes invalid, it may eliminate a risk or may give rise to a new risk.
            Determining whether the current analysis has changed the risk assessment. The
            change in the risk assessment may require changes in other aspects of the project,
            such as cost, schedule, and contingency reserves.
       Figure 11.7 illustrates the Monitor and Control Risks process. The risk register and risk man-
       agement plan contain the list of risks you identified during risk planning and the responses
       you will execute if the risks occur. Work performance information from project execution and
       performance reports is also useful in monitoring risks. These items can help you determine
       whether risk response plans are being implemented, if those implementations are producing
       the desired results, and if there are signs of new risks.

       FIGURE 11.7 The Monitor and Control Risks process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

   To monitor and control risks, you must have a list of identified risks, a plan to deal with the
   risks, and the signs of risk occurrence. Accordingly, the input items to risk monitoring and con-
   trolling are risk management plans, risk registers, approved change requests, and work perfor-
   mance information. These items were discussed in Chapter 6. The tools and techniques for
   risk monitoring and the output from it are discussed in the following sections.


Tools and Techniques for Risk Monitoring and Controlling
   There are some tools and techniques available to detect risk triggers, to respond effectively to
   the risks that have occurred, and to identify new risks.
   Risk reassessment. Risks should be continually reassessed as the project progresses. For exam-
   ple, a risk on the watch list might become important enough that you might need to prepare
   a response plan for it. On the other hand, a risk may disappear and should then be closed.
   Risk audits. A risk audit is conducted to examine the following:
        Root causes of the identified risks
        Effectiveness of responses to the identified risks
        Effectiveness of risk management processes
   The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk assessments and risk audits are con-
   ducted with needed frequency.
   Risk analyses. Risk analyses are necessary to effectively respond to risks that have occurred, to
   detect risk triggers, and to identify new risks. The following two kinds of analyses are appro-
   priate for risk monitoring:
        Variance and trend analysis. Trends in project performance should be reviewed on a
        regular basis as the project execution progresses. These trends can be determined by
        analyzing the performance data based on various performance control techniques,
        such as variance and earned value analysis, discussed earlier in this chapter. This
        analysis can help in detecting new risks.
334   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


            Reserve analysis. Recall that the contingency reserve is the amount of funds or time
            (in the schedule) in addition to the planned budget reserved to keep the impact of
            risks to an acceptable level when the project is executing. The risks occurring during
            project execution can have positive or negative effects on contingency reserve. You
            perform reserve analysis at a given time to compare the remaining reserve amount to
            the remaining risk to determine whether the remaining reserve amount is adequate.
       Technical performance measurement. Technical performance measurements compare actual
       versus planned parameters related to the overall technical progress of the project. The devia-
       tion determines the degree to which system requirements are met in terms of performance, cost,
       schedule, and progress in implementing risk handling. The parameters chosen to measure tech-
       nical performance could be any parameters that represent something important related to the
       project objectives and requirements; software performance, human resource performance, and
       system test performance are some examples.
       Status meetings. You should always put risk management as an agenda item at project status
       meetings. The time spent on this item will depend on the number of identified risks, their pri-
       orities, and the complexity of the responses planned for them. Nevertheless, keeping risk on
       your agenda and discussing risks with the team on a regular basis helps make risk management
       smoother and more effective.
       These tools and techniques are used to monitor risks that might generate recommendations
       for actions, which are parts of the output of the risk monitoring and controlling processes.


   Output from Risk Monitoring and Controlling
       The output of monitoring risks includes recommendations for actions and requests for changes
       to control the risks. These and other output items are discussed in the following paragraphs.
       Change requests. You will need to make some change requests as a result of risk monitoring
       and controlling. The change requests may arise from recommended actions. For example, rec-
       ommended actions, such as contingency plans and workarounds, might result in requirements
       to change some elements of the project management plan to respond to certain risks. Of course,
       the change requests will need to go through the integrated change control process for approval,
       and the approved change requests will become the input to the Direct and Manage Project Exe-
       cution process for implementation.
       There are two kinds of actions recommended as a result of risk monitoring: corrective actions
       and preventive actions. Corrective actions include contingency plans and workaround plans. A
       workaround is a response to a negative risk that has occurred. A workaround is based on a quick
       solution and is not planned in advance of the risk occurrence event. Preventive actions are rec-
       ommended to bring the project into compliance with the project management plan. Recom-
       mended corrective and preventive actions are input to the integrated change control process.

  Updates. The risk monitoring and controlling processes might require updates to the follow-
  ing items:
       Risk register. You might need to include the following updates to the risk register:
        Outcomes of risk reassessments, risk reviews, and risk audits
        Outcomes of risks and responses to risks
       Project management plan. The project management plan might need to be updated
       as a result of risk monitoring and controlling. For example, change requests might
       change the risk management processes, which in turn will change the project man-
       agement plan.
       Organizational process assets. As a result of the risk monitoring and controlling
       processes, some organizational process assets might need to be updated, such as tem-
       plates for the project management plan, the historical information database for such
       information as actual costs and durations of project activities, the lessons-learned
       knowledge database, and checklists.
  Performance reports used as input in risk controlling are generated during performance
  reporting.



Performance Reporting
  Figure 11.8 presents performance reporting in the context of the big picture. While you are
  directing and managing the project execution, the work results and the progress toward creat-
  ing the project results are generated. Just producing the results is no guarantee of success. Suc-
  cess is determined by the performance with which the results are being produced. You need to
  know the performance to keep the project on the right track. Furthermore, the stakeholders
  need to know with what rate, efficiency, and work quality the resources are being used to deliver
  the project output. For this, you need to collect the project performance data and use this data
  to make performance measurements while controlling the scope, schedule, and cost. You use
  this data and performance measurements to prepare performance reports, which in turn are
  used for distributing information and controlling risks.
  Performance reporting is the process of collecting performance information, putting it into the
  distribution format, and distributing it. Performance reporting, for brevity, is also called report-
  ing and is focused on the following components:
       Project status. The current state of the project.
       Project progress. The progress made with some previous state as a reference.
       Forecast. The prediction of the progress in the future based on the progress in the
       past.

                          processes.



                   CAUTION
            Do not confuse the Report Performance process with the Distribute Information
            process discussed in Chapter 9, even though you must recognize the overlap. Distrib-
            uting information means distributing all the relevant information, whereas perfor-
            mance reporting focuses on the performance part of the information. You can use the
            information distribution system to report performance.



       The formal name for the process used for performance reporting is Report Performance, and
       it is illustrated in Figure 11.9.

       FIGURE 11.9 The Report Performance process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


What Goes into Performance Reporting
   The core of performance reporting is to use performance measurements to prepare performance
   reports. To serve this core, the following items are needed as an input to the performance
   reporting process:
   Performance measurements. These measurements are mostly made in other monitoring and
   controlling processes, such as control scope, control schedule, and control cost. However, you
   may need to make some measurements during the performance reporting process.
   Work performance data. To make performance measurements and to put them in the right
   perspective, you need the work performance data that you collected during monitoring and con-
   trolling project execution.
   Project management plan. This plan has project baselines, such as scope baseline, schedule
   baseline, and cost baseline. The work performance data is compared to these baselines to make
   performance measurements.
   Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets that may come in handy in
   preparing the performance reports include report templates, measurement guidelines, and
   variance limits accepted in the organization.


Tools and Techniques for Performance Reporting
   Tools and techniques used in performance reporting include communication methods, variance
   analysis, forecasting techniques, and reporting systems. Communication methods were dis-
   cussed in Chapter 4, and variance analysis will be discussed in Chapter 12. Forecasting tech-
   niques include the following:
        Earned value forecasting techniques. The forecasting techniques based on the
        earned value analysis are discussed in Chapter 12.
338   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


            Extrapolation techniques. Extrapolation is a scientific method to predict future
            results based on past data. It makes use of concepts such as trend, growth, and decay.
            These techniques are also called time series methods.
            Causal methods. These techniques are based on predicting the behavior of a vari-
            able by identifying the underlying causes of that behavior. Regression analysis is an
            example of such methods.
            Judgmental techniques. These techniques use intuitive judgment in making predic-
            tions and can also use other methods, such as analogy and the Delphi technique.
       Reporting systems. A reporting system is used to collect, store, maintain, and distribute
       information. Modern reporting systems often include software tools. There can be specialized
       reporting systems to support performance reporting, including the following:
            Cost reporting system. This system can store and report the cost expended on the
            project and on its different activities and aspects.
            Time reporting system. This system can store and report how much time has been
            expended on the project and on its different activities and aspects.
       These tools and techniques can be used to generate the output of performance reporting.


   What Comes Out of Performance Reporting
       Performance reports are an obvious output of performance reporting. This and other output
       items are discussed in the following paragraphs.
       Project performance reports. Performance reports present relevant information from work
       performance data and performance measurements in a suitable format. The relevancy and suit-
       ability depend on the audience--the stakeholders that are the consumers of these reports. The
       report format may include presentation elements such as tables, bar charts, and histograms in
       order to make the information easy to understand. The performance reports can contain the
       following:
            Summary of work performance information. Results from the comparison of the
            actual work results to the planned performance--that is, the performance baseline.
            Current status. The current state in which the project is right now.
            Progress. Progress made from some reference point in the past. The status refers to
            where the things are right now, and the progress refers to what has been accom-
            plished since a previous status.
       Forecasts. Performance reporting includes making forecasts based on past performance. These
       forecasts include estimates such as what the total cost incurred at project completion will be--
       called estimate at completion (EAC)--and how much cost will be incurred to complete the
       remaining project--called estimate to complete (ETC). These forecasts can be updated as more
       performance information comes in.

  Change requests. Measuring and communicating performance may generate change requests,
  which must be processed through integrated change control before implementation. For exam-
  ple, performance reporting may expose that certain aspects of the project are not on the right
  track or the project is not performing as expected by the stakeholders. The forecasting may
  expose danger ahead. All this can generate recommendations for corrective and preventive
  actions.
  Updates to organizational process assets. During performance reporting, there will be lots of
  revelations by performance measurements and feedback from the stakeholders. This will result
  in updating the organizational process assets, such as lessons learned.
  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are the following:
       Quality control is the process of monitoring and controlling specific project results
       to ensure the implementation of the quality plan and recommending changes or
       actions in case of poor implementation.
       The risk monitoring and controlling processes are used to monitor and control the
       identified risks and to look out for new risks.
       Work performance measurements made during monitoring and controlling scope,
       schedule, and cost are the raw data for performance reporting. The core of perfor-
       mance reporting is to prepare and distribute performance reports to the right stake-
       holders at the right time by using the right methods and formats.



Summary
  You need to monitor and control your project throughout its lifecycle, which includes moni-
  toring and controlling quality, risks, and performance communication--the three interrelated
  processes. Quality is controlled by using the Perform Quality Control process, a process of
  monitoring and recording the results from the execution of projects, including the quality activ-
  ities. The goal is to evaluate quality performance and recommend necessary changes. To ensure
  quality, you must control risks as well. Risks are monitored and controlled by using the Mon-
  itor and Control Risks process, which uses the risk register and performance reports as major
  input items. The performance reports are prepared by using the Report Performance process,
  which uses work performance information and work performance measurements as input. The
  goal here is to prepare and distribute the performance reports to the right stakeholders at the
  right time by using the right methods and formats.
  High-quality projects deliver the promised product, service, or result within the planned cost,
  schedule, and scope. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and control changes to these three
  parameters discussed in the next chapter: cost, schedule, and scope.
340   Part IV          MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       Exam's Eye View
         Comprehend

          The Report Performance process generates performance reports, which are used as input to the
            Monitor and Control Risks process.

          Work performance measurements generated by controlling scope, schedule, and cost are used
            as input to prepare performance reports and to control quality.

          Work performance information generated by the Direct and Manage Project Execution
            process is used as an input to prepare performance reports and to control risks.

          Like most of the monitor and control processes, the Perform Quality Control, Monitor and
            Control Risks, and Report Performance processes generate change requests.

         Look Out

          The Report Performance process belongs to the monitoring and controlling process group and
            not to the executing process group.

          Deliverables are an important input to the Perform Quality Control process.
          Approved change requests, and not all change requests, are an input to the Perform Quality
            Control process.

          Both change requests and validation of changes are output of the Perform Quality Control
            process.

         Memorize

          The processes to monitor and control quality, risk, and performance communication are
            Perform Quality Control, Monitor and Control Risks, and Report Performance.

          The Report Performance process belongs to the project communication management knowl-
            edge area.

          Budget forecasts are an input to the Report Performance process.
          Validation of deliverables is an output of the Perform Quality Control process.

Introduction
  High-quality projects deliver the promised product, service, or result within the planned bud-
  get, schedule, and scope. This is also a very important and basic criterion of success: Complete
  the project with complete scope, on schedule, and within budget. So, it should not come as a
  surprise when the project performance is largely measured by making integrated measures of
  scope, schedule, and cost and comparing them to the scope, schedule, and cost baselines. Cost
  and time are the underlying fundamental parameters that determine budget and schedule,
  respectively. So, the three fundamental parameters that we are talking about here are scope,
  time, and cost. You will see in this chapter that these three project parameters are intrinsically
  connected by a triangular relationship. Because the success of the project depends largely on
  how you manage this triangle, we call it the golden triangle.
  So, the core issue in this chapter is how to monitor and control the golden triangle. In search
  of an answer, we will explore three avenues: scope control, schedule control, and cost control.



Controlling Scope, Schedule, and Cost:
Big Picture
  The nutshell of running a project is delivering the scope according to some schedule, which
  will cost someone. Completing a project successfully includes delivering the planned scope
  according to the planned schedule and within the planned budget. The fundamental parame-
  ters for budget and schedule are cost and time, respectively. Budget is the cost with a timeline,
  and schedule is determined from the time estimates for completing the schedule activities. So
  scope, time, and cost make the heart of any project. These three project parameters comprise
  a triple constraint that is a framework for evaluating competing demands. A triple constraint
  is often depicted as a triangle, with each side representing one of these three parameters. Fig-
  ure 12.1 shows the triple constraint for scope, time, and cost. This means if one of these para-
  meters changes, at least one of the other two must change as well.


               CAUTION
        Don't be confused if you see the triple constraint referred to as scope, schedule, and
        cost constraint as well as scope, time, and cost constraint. Time and schedule are
        intrinsically connected.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                            Chapter 12         347




          FIGURE 12.1 Triple constraint: scope, time, and cost. You cannot change one side of the triangle
                          without changing at least one of the other two sides.

   For example, assume you are being interviewed by a functional manager for a project manager
   position. Don't be surprised if you are asked a question based on the following situation:
     1. The project is way behind the schedule.
     2. No extra resources, such as money or project team members to perform activities, are
        available.
     3. You have to implement all the planned features.

   The question is, what will you do to meet the deadline that is approaching within a week? From
   a project management viewpoint, this situation is a good example of the triple constraint. The
   project is behind schedule, which means there is a schedule change (or a change in time avail-
   able to finish the remaining project). Therefore, at least one of the other two parameters must
   change. If you want to meet the deadline, either you should be allotted more funds to hire
   more human resources or the scope of the project should be changed, which means some of
   the features would be left out. Depending upon the knowledge level of the functional manager
   about project management, this answer might not get you the job, but as a project manager,
   you must stand your ground. Project management is not magic; it involves dealing with cold,
   hard reality in a realistic way, thereby establishing clear and achievable objectives.


                   NOTE
           While considering the cost-schedule-scope constraint, you should also remember the
           schedule compression techniques, such as crashing and fast tracking, discussed in
           Chapter 4. Also, remember that those techniques do not guarantee that no additional
           cost (or resources) will be required.


   You can see the relationship of triple constraint to quality by recalling that a high-quality pro-
   ject delivers the required product on time and within the planned scope and budget. There-
   fore, while balancing between these three constraints, the quality (and as a result, customer
   satisfaction) might be affected. The triple constraint is also a good example of how one change
   can give rise to other changes across the project. This highlights the importance of managing
   and controlling changes.
348   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       Changes to scope, schedule, and cost are controlled using the Control Scope, Control Sched-
       ule, and Control Cost processes, respectively, which are discussed in this chapter. These three
       processes are at the center of the project action. As Figure 12.2 illustrates, they take work per-
       formance information from the project execution and generate work performance measure-
       ments that are used by the quality control process to generate quality control measurements
       and by the report performance process to generate performance reports.




           FIGURE 12.2 The processes to control scope, schedule, and cost in a big picture.


       Cost is incurred in executing a schedule, which depends on the scope.



   Controlling Scope
       Controlling the project scope includes influencing factors that create changes to the scope, as
       well as managing change requests and controlling their impact when the change actually occurs.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                      Chapter 12    349


   While controlling the scope, you focus on the following tasks:
        Watch out for scope creep. Determine whether it has happened and correct the situ-
        ation. Scope creep refers to scope changes applied without processing them though
        the change control process.
        Process the scope change requests through the integrated change control process for
        approval.
        Manage the implementation of scope changes after approval, as well as their impact
        across the project.



               TIP
         In real life, scope creeps occur for various reasons. For example, perhaps a develop-
         ment engineer thought something was a cool feature to implement, or the customer
         spoke directly with the engineer to make a request for a minor additional feature, or
         various other similar situations occurred. If scope creep has taken your project off
         track, you need to take corrective actions to get the project back on the track. You
         should also investigate how the scope creep happened and take steps to prevent it in
         the future--for example, by educating team members about the proper scope change
         process.




       FIGURE 12.3 The Control Scope process: input, tools and techniques, and output.

   The obvious input items to the scope control process are the elements that define the scope,
   such as the project scope statement, the scope baseline, the WBS, the WBS dictionary, and a
   scope management plan that describes how to manage the scope. The performance reports
   might help to detect a scope change, and some change requests in other areas can result in scope
   change, as well.
350   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       The main output of the scope control process is the update to scope-related input elements,
       such as the project scope statement, the WBS, the WBS dictionary, and the scope baseline. The
       components of the project management plan affected by these changes might also need to be
       updated. Change requests and recommendations for corrective actions are other obvious out-
       put items from the scope control process.
       The main tools used in the scope control process are the change control system and the pro-
       ject performance analysis, including the scope variance and the schedule variance. Schedule
       variance can have an effect on the scope if you want to finish the project on time and there are
       no additional resources available. The change control system of an organization is a collection
       of formal documented procedures that specify how the project deliverables and documents will
       be changed, controlled, and approved.
       You monitor the project by watching its progress, which is a measure of its performance. There-
       fore, performance measurement and analysis make up an important category of tools and tech-
       niques in monitoring and controlling the project.



   Controlling Schedule
       Schedule control has a two-pronged goal--to ensure that the project is progressing on time as
       planned and to monitor any changes to this progress. As a project manager, you should be out
       in front of the project, performing the following tasks on a regular basis:
            Determining the current status of the project schedule
            Influencing the factors that generate schedule changes
            Determining whether the project schedule has changed--for example, if some activi-
            ties are running late
            Managing changes as they occur
       You detect a schedule change by comparing the execution time to the time in the schedule base-
       line, which is a major input item into the schedule control process. This is formally called
       Control Schedule and is illustrated in Figure 12.4.


       Input to Schedule Control
       To control the project schedule, you need to know what the schedule baseline (that is, the
       expectation) is, how the project is performing from the perspective of schedule, and what the
       plans are to monitor the schedule. Accordingly, the input items to the schedule control process
       are the following:
            Schedule management plan. This plan specifies how to monitor and control the
            project at hand.
            Schedule baseline. This is the approved version of the schedule, against which the
            schedule performance of the project will be measured.

        Performance reports. These reports provide information on the schedule perfor-
        mance of the project, such as missed and met planned dates.
        Approved change requests. These are requests to change the schedule or other
        change requests that will affect the schedule. Approved change requests can update
        the schedule baseline.


   Tools and Techniques for Schedule Control
   The schedule is monitored by progress reporting and performance measurements and is con-
   trolled using the schedule control system. These and other tools and techniques are discussed
   in this section.
   Progress reporting. Progress reports and current schedule status are key items to monitor the
   schedule. They can include finished activities, the percent of in-progress activities that have
   been completed, and remaining durations for unfinished activities.
   Schedule change control system. This is the system you use to receive, evaluate, and process
   schedule changes. It can include forms, procedures, approval committees, and tracking systems.
   Performance measurement and analysis. The following tools and techniques can be used to
   measure and analyze the schedule performance of the project:
        Performance measurement techniques. These techniques are used to calculate the
        schedule variance and schedule performance index and are discussed in the "Measur-
        ing Performance" section later in this chapter. The schedule variance discussed there
        is in terms of cost, but you can also perform a barebones schedule variance analysis
        based on the start and end dates of the schedule activities.
        Variance analysis. Performing a barebones schedule variance analysis is crucial to
        schedule monitoring because it reveals the deviation of the actual start and finish
        dates from the planned start and finish dates of schedule activities. It might suggest
        corrective actions to be taken to keep the project on the track.
352   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


            Schedule comparison bar charts. Bar charts can be used to facilitate the schedule
            variance analysis. You can draw two bars corresponding to one schedule activity--
            one bar shows the actual progress, and the other bar shows the expected progress
            according to the baseline. This is a great tool to visually display where the schedule
            has progressed as planned and where it has slipped.



                   TIP
             A schedule variance does not necessarily mean that a schedule change is required.
             For example, a delay on a schedule activity that is not on the critical path might not
             trigger any schedule change.



       Project management software. You can use project management software for scheduling to
       track planned start/finish dates versus actual dates for schedule activities. This software also
       enables you to predict the effects of project schedule changes. These are important pieces of
       information for monitoring and controlling the schedule.


       Output of Schedule Control
       Schedule performance measurements and recommendations for actions based on the measure-
       ments and progress reports are the important output items of the schedule control process.
       Performance measurements. The results from schedule performance measurements, such as
       the schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI), should be documented and
       communicated to stakeholders. These measurements might trigger recommendations for cor-
       rective actions and change requests.
       Recommended corrective actions. The goal of schedule-related corrective actions is to bring
       the future schedule performance in line with the schedule baseline--that is, the approved ver-
       sion of the planned schedule. To that end, the following actions can be taken:
            Expedite the execution to ensure that schedule activities are completed on time or
            with minimal delay.
            Perform a root cause analysis to identify the causes of the schedule variance.
            Make plans to recover from the schedule delay.



                   TIP
             Remember that corrective actions are not about going back and fixing past mistakes.
             Rather, they're about ensuring that future results match with the plan. You can do this
             by influencing future results, such as expediting the execution, or by changing the plan.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                   Chapter 12         353


   Updates. The following updates can result from the schedule control process:
        Schedule updates. Schedule changes can happen at the activity level (the start/end
        date of an activity has changed) or at the project level (the start/end date of the pro-
        ject has changed). A schedule change at the project level is called a schedule revision.
        For example, when the schedule scope is expanded, the project end date might have
        to be changed to allow the extra work. All significant schedule changes must be
        reported to the stakeholders.
        Activity updates. The schedule changes and the project progress will cause changes
        in the activity list and in the list of activity attributes. These changes must be docu-
        mented.
        Project management plan. The schedule management plan, a component of the
        project management plan, is updated to reflect the changes that occur during the
        schedule control process.
        Organizational process assets. The lessons learned from the schedule control
        process can be documented to the historical database. Following are some examples:
         The causes of schedule variance
         The reasons for choosing the corrective actions that were taken
         The effectiveness of the corrective actions
        Future projects can make use of this information.
   Change requests. The schedule performance analysis and progress report review can result in
   requests for changes to the project schedule baseline. These changes must be processed through
   the integrated change control process for approval. As with any other change, you must think
   through whether a change to the schedule baseline has any other effect across the project. If it
   does, you might need to update the corresponding component of the project management plan
   accordingly.
   The project schedule is there to execute the project work within the planned scope and cost of
   the project. So, the project cost must be controlled as well.



Controlling Cost
   Controlling cost means monitoring and controlling updates and changes to costs, budget, and
   the cost baseline of the project. Monitoring and controlling costs has two dimensions to it:
   expenditure of project funds and the work performed as a result of those expenditures. One
   major aspect of cost monitoring and controlling is to determine the relationship between the
   expenditures and the accomplishments. The cost performance lays in this relationship. The
   other main aspect is to control the changes to the approved cost performance baseline.
354   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT



                   CAUTION
             Like any other change, change in cost and budget must also be processed through the
             integrated change control process and should only be implemented after its approval.




       To be more specific, monitoring and controlling the project cost includes the following tasks:
            Influence the factors that can create changes to the approved cost baseline.
            Monitor the following:
             Work performed against the funds expended
             Variance of cost performance from the approved baseline
            Prevent unapproved changes from creeping into cost reports and expenditures.
            Act to keep cost overruns within the planned acceptable limits.
            Ensure the following:
             Change requests are dealt with in a timely fashion and managed as they occur.
             Expenditures do not exceed the approved budget by period or by total amount.
                Any change to the budget must be approved before implementation.
            Communicate with the appropriate stakeholders about the cost associated with the
            approved changes.
       Cost is monitored and controlled by using the Control Cost process illustrated in Figure 12.5.




           FIGURE 12.5 The Control Cost process: input, tools and techniques, and output.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                     Chapter 12       355


   The input items to this process are the project management plan, work performance informa-
   tion, project funding requirements, and organizational process assets. The items in the project
   management plan useful for controlling cost are the cost management plan and the cost per-
   formance baseline. The cost management plan describes how the cost will be monitored and
   controlled. The cost performance baseline--or cost baseline for short--is an approved budget;
   that is, the cost with the timeline for the project attached to it. Work performance informa-
   tion contains performance-related data from the execution of the project, including how much
   cost has been incurred in performing certain tasks. This cost can be compared to the planned
   cost to make the cost performance measurements. Project funding requirements are part of the
   cost baseline. Organizational process assets that can influence the cost control include cost con-
   trol-related policies, procedures, and guidelines; monitoring and reporting methods; and tools
   used in controlling cost.
   The Control Cost process converts the cost-related project performance information into pro-
   ject performance measurements by using some tools and techniques, such as the earned value
   technique, variance analysis, and forecasting. These tools and techniques are discussed in the
   next section. Performance reviews compare the actual progress to the planned progress. Pro-
   ject management software can be used for earned value management.
   Work performance measurements made by comparing the work performance information to
   the planned performance are the obvious output of the Control Cost process. The analysis of
   the project performance can result in making some change requests to keep the project on track.
   The budget forecasts can be made from the earned value analysis. The causes of the variance
   of the progress from the planned progress and the lessons learned become part of the organi-
   zational process assets that can be used in future projects.
   A common input to controlling scope, schedule, and cost is work performance information,
   and a common output is work performance measurements. That means these three processes
   use work performance information to make performance measurements.



Measuring Performance
   Project performance is measured by comparing the project execution to the performance mea-
   surement baseline, which is an approved integrated plan for scope, schedule, and cost for the
   project, as explained here:
        Cost baseline. This is the planned budget for the project over a time period, used as
        a basis against which to measure, monitor, and control the cost performance of the
        project. The cost performance is measured by comparing the actual cost to the
        planned cost over a time period.
        Schedule baseline. This is a specific version of the project schedule developed from
        the schedule network analysis and the schedule model data, discussed in Chapter 4.
        This is the approved version of the schedule with a start date and an end date, and it
        is used as a basis against which the project schedule performance is measured.
356   Part IV         MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


                Scope baseline. This is the approved project scope that includes the approved pro-
                ject scope statement, the WBS based on the approved project scope statement, and
                the corresponding WBS dictionary.
       The elaborate nature of the performance measurement analysis can be seen in the cost control
       process.


   Performance Measurement Analysis for Cost Control
       As mentioned earlier, cost control includes influencing the factors that can create changes to
       the cost baseline. But to detect arising changes, you need to detect and understand variances
       from the cost baseline by monitoring cost performance.
       In general, variance is a measurable deviation in the value of a project variable (or parameter),
       such as cost or schedule, from a known baseline or expected value. Variance analysis is a tech-
       nique used to assess the magnitude of variation in the value of a variable, such as cost from the
       baseline or expected value, determine the cause of the variance, and decide whether a correc-
       tive action is required. A common technique to assess cost variance is called the earned value
       technique (EVT), also called earned value management (EVM). It is a commonly used method
       of performance measurement that has various forms. Most often, it integrates scope, schedule,
       and cost performance by comparing the baselines to the actual progress made. For example, you
       calculate the cumulative value of the budgeted cost of work performed in terms of the origi-
       nally allocated budgeted amount and compare it to the following:
          1. Budgeted cost of work scheduled--that is, planned
          2. Actual cost of work performed

       Don't worry if these terms sound confusing right now; I will go through an example soon.
       However, as you will see, the greatest difficulty in understanding EVT (or EVM) stems from
       the coupling of cost and schedule. You must realize that the project cost and the project sched-
       ule are inherently related to each other. Schedule relates to performing certain work over a cer-
       tain time period, whereas cost refers to the money spent to perform the work on a project (or
       a project activity) over a certain period of time. The relationship between cost and schedule
       can be realized by understanding that it costs money to perform a schedule activity. The "time
       is money" principle is at work here. For example, a project activity can be looked upon in terms
       of an amount of work that will be needed to complete it or in terms of its monetary value, which
       will include the cost of the work that needs to be performed to complete the activity.


                      CAUTION
                As you delve into EVM, remember that there are only three parameters that need to
                be monitored and developed closely: planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and
                actual cost (AC). The rest of the parameters and the earned value analysis are
                largely based on these three fundamental parameters.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                      Chapter 12           357


   The EVT involves calculating some variables where you will see the interplay of schedule
   (work) and cost. I will work through an example to help you understand the variables. Assume
   you are a project manager for the construction of a 16-mile road. Further assume that the work
   is uniformly distributed over 12 weeks. The total approved budget for this project is $600,000.
   At the end of first four weeks of work, $125,000 has been spent, and four miles of road have
   been completed.
   I will use this example to perform the cost performance analysis and the schedule performance
   analysis in terms of cost.

   Cost Performance
   Cost performance refers to how efficiently you are spending money on the project work, mea-
   sured against the expectations set in the project management plan--that is, the cost baselines.
   The total cost approved in the baseline is called the budget at completion (BAC).


                NOTE
         The variables discussed here, such as BAC, EV, and AC, can be calculated either for
         the whole project or for a part of the project, such as a project activity.


   Budget at completion (BAC). This is the total budget authorized for performing the project
   work (or a project activity), also called the planned budget. In other words, it is the cost origi-
   nally estimated in the project management plan. You use this variable in defining almost all
   the following variables. In our example, the value of BAC is $600,000.
   Earned value (EV) or budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP). This is the value of the
   actual performed work expressed in terms of the approved budget for a project or a project activ-
   ity for a given time period. In this variable, you see the relationship of schedule (work) and cost
   in action. BAC represents the total value of the project. But when you perform some work on
   the project, you have earned some of that value, and the earned value is proportional to the frac-
   tion of the total work performed, as shown by the formula here:
           EV=BACx(work completed/total work required)
   So, in our example, EV can be calculated as:
           EV=$600,000x(4 miles/16 miles)=$150,000
   This is the earned value of the work, which may or may not be equal to the actual money that
   you spent to perform this work.
   Actual cost (AC) or actual cost of work performed (ACWP). This is the total cost actually
   incurred until a specific point on the timeline in performing the work for a project. In our run-
   ning example, $125,000 has already been used up to this point. So the actual cost at this point
   in time is $125,000. This cost is to be compared to the earned value to calculate the cost vari-
   ance and cost performance.
358   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       Cost variance (CV). This is a measure of cost performance in terms of deviation of reality from
       the plan, and it is obtained by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the earned value (EV), as
       shown in the formula here:
                CV=EV-AC
       So, in our example, CV can be calculated as shown here:
                CV=$150,000-$125,000=$25, 000
       The expected value of CV is zero because we expect the earned value to be equal to the actual
       cost. The positive result indicates better cost performance than expected, whereas a negative
       result indicates worse cost performance than expected. Deviation is one way of comparison,
       and ratio is another.
       Cost performance index (CPI). Earned value represents the portion of work completed, and
       actual cost represents the money spent. So, the CPI indicates whether you are getting a fair
       value for your money. This is a measure of cost efficiency of a project calculated by dividing
       earned value (EV) by actual cost (AC), as shown in the formula here:




       So, the CPI for our example can be calculated as:
                CPI=$150,000/$125,000=1.2
       This means you are getting $1.20 worth of performance for every dollar spent. A value of CPI
       greater than one indicates good performance, whereas a value less than one indicates bad per-
       formance. The expected value of CPI is one.
       So both the CV and the CPI indicate that you are getting more value for each dollar spent.
       Hold back a little before opening the champagne, though. If you read the text of our example
       again, note that four out of 12 weeks have already passed, and only four out of 16 miles of road
       have been built. That means that only one-fourth of the work has been accomplished in one-
       third of the total scheduled time. This means we are lagging behind in our schedule. Although
       cost performance is good, schedule performance needs to be investigated, too.


       Schedule Performance in Terms of Cost
       Schedule performance refers to how efficiently you are executing your project schedule as mea-
       sured against the expectations set in the project management plan. It can be measured by com-
       paring the earned value to the planned value, just like cost performance is measured by
       comparing the earned value to the actual cost. Planned value refers to the value that we planned
       to create in the time spent so far.
       Planned value (PV) or budgeted cost for the work scheduled (BCWS). This is the autho-
       rized cost for the scheduled work on the project or a project activity up to a given point on the
       timescale. The planned value is also called the budgeted cost for the work scheduled (BCWS). PV
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                  Chapter 12        359


   is basically how much you were authorized to spend in the fraction of schedule time spent so
   far, as shown in the formula here:
           PV=BACx(time passed/total schedule time)
   Therefore, the planned value for the project in our example at the end of the first four weeks
   is calculated as shown here:
           PV=$600,000x(4 weeks/12 weeks)=$200,000
   So, PV represents the planned schedule in terms of cost. You can calculate the schedule per-
   formance by comparing the planned schedule to the performed schedule in terms of cost.


               CAUTION
        Note that the total planned value (PV) of the project is the same as the budget at
        completion (BAC).



   Schedule variance (SV). This is the deviation of the performed schedule from the planned
   schedule in terms of cost. No confusion is allowed here because you already know that the
   schedule can be translated to cost. SV is calculated as the difference between EV and PV, as
   shown in the formula here:
           SV=EV-PV
   So, the SV in our example can be calculated as:
           SV=$150,000-$200,000=-$50,000
   The negative value means we are behind schedule. Deviation represented by schedule variance
   is one way of comparison, and ratio represented by schedule performance index is another.
   Schedule performance index (SPI). Earned value represents the portion of work completed
   in terms of cost, and planned value represents how much work was planned by this point in
   time in terms of cost. So, the SPI indicates how the performed work compared to the planned
   work. This is a measure of the schedule efficiency of a project calculated by dividing earned
   value (EV) by planned value (PV), as shown in the formula here:




   So, the SPI for our example can be calculated as shown here:
           SPI=$150,000/$200,000=0.75
   This indicates that the project is progressing at 75% of the planned pace--not good.
360   Part IV      MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


       You should note that all these performance variables except the BAC are calculated at a given
       point in time. As shown in Figure 12.6, you can maintain a graphic that presents the values of
       these variables against points in time as the project progresses. Note that the value of the BAC
       does not change with time because it is the cost at completion time. Further note that given
       the BAC, the PV can be calculated at any point in time, even before the project execution starts.
       EV and AC are accumulated as the project execution progresses.




           FIGURE 12.6 The behavior of some performance variables as the project progresses in time. The
                           variable BAC is independent of time.

       By using the variables discussed so far, you can monitor the project performance as time pro-
       gresses. Not only that, you can also make predictions about future performance based on past
       performance.


       Forecasting Techniques
       Forecasting refers to predicting some information about the project in the future based on the
       performance in the past. The forecasting is regularly updated as the project progresses and more
       data from the past performance becomes available.
       Estimate to complete (ETC) at budgeted rate. This is the prediction about the expected cost
       to complete the remaining work for the project or for a project activity. The future work is
       assumed to be completed at the budgeted rate. Therefore, the value of the ETC is obtained by
       subtracting the earned value (EV) from the budget at completion (BAC), as shown in the for-
       mula here:
                ETC=BAC-EV
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE                                      Chapter 12           361


     So, in our example, the value of ETC can be calculated as:
              ETC=$600,000-$150,000=$450,000
     This is true if the current variances are seen as atypical and the future performance is expected
     to be as planned. If the current trend, however, continues, then we need to take CPI into
     account, as shown next.
     Estimate to complete (ETC) at the present CPI. This is the prediction about the expected
     cost to complete the remaining work at the present CPI. Therefore, in that case, the ETC is
     given by:




     The next question that can be asked about the future is how much it will cost to complete the
     whole project.


STUDY CHECKPOINT 12.1
 In our running example, calculate the ETC at the present CPI. Note that CPI is calculated as 1.2
 in our running example from earlier in this chapter.



     Estimate at completion (EAC) at the budgeted rate. This is the estimate made at the current
     point in time for how much it will cost to complete the whole project or a project activity from
     beginning to end. It is assumed that the future work will be performed at the budgeted rate.
     Therefore, the value of the EAC is obtained by adding the value of ETC at the budgeted rate
     to AC, as shown in the formula here:
              EAC=AC+ETC (budgeted rate)
     Accordingly, the value of EAC for our example can be calculated as:
              EAC=$125,000+$450,000=$575,000
     Another useful prediction to be made is how much performance you need in the future to
     complete the remaining work within budget.


STUDY CHECKPOINT 12.2
Prove the validity of the following equation:
    EAC=AC+BAC-EV
362     Part IV        MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


          EAC calculated thus far is correct under the assumption that in the future the cost will be
          incurred as it was budgeted or performance will be made as planned. If, however, the current
          variance trend is assumed to continue, then EAC is calculated as discussed next.
          Estimate at completion (EAC) at the present CPI. This is the estimate made at the current
          point in time for how much it will cost to complete the whole project or a project activity from
          beginning to end. It is assumed that the future work will be performed at the current CPI.
          Therefore, EAC is calculated as follows:
                   EAC=AC+ETC (at current CPI)




      STUDY CHECKPOINT 12.3
      In our running example, calculate EAC at the present CPI. Note that CPI is calculated as 1.2 in
      our running example from earlier in this chapter.



          As stated earlier, performance is an integrated measure of progress in the areas of scope, sched-
          ule, and cost. Just measuring one of these parameters may be misleading. For example, in our
          running example, we are performing better in cost but poorly in schedule. This is why some-
          times EAC is measured by taking into account both CPI and SPI, as shown here:




      STUDY CHECKPOINT 12.4
      In our running example, calculate EAC at the present CPI. Note that CPI is calculated as 1.2 and
      SPI is calculated as 0.75 in our running examples from earlier in this chapter.



          To complete performance index (TCPI). This is the variable to predict the future performance
          needed to finish the work according to a specified goal--for example, either within the planned
          budget (BAC) or at the completion cost currently predicted (EAC). If the goal is to complete
          it within the BAC, it is calculated as the ratio of the remaining work to the remaining budget,

     Therefore, the value of TCPI in our example can be calculated as:
                TCPI=($600,000-$150,000)/($600,000-$125,000)=450,000/475,000=0.95=95%.
     If it is realized that BAC is not attainable, then it is replaced with EAC. Accordingly, TCPI
     will be given by:

           So, during the executing stage, the obvious items that need to be executed are the schedule
           activities, and while these activities are being executed, the attached cost, schedule, and scope
           need to be monitored and controlled. However, there is another important component of the
           project that needs to be monitored and controlled--the risk.
           The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
                  Scope, cost, and time make a triple constraint: Change in one of them changes one
                  or both of the others.
                  A project is monitored by continually measuring its performance as it progresses.
                  The performance baseline to which the project progress is to be compared largely
                  consists of scope baseline, schedule baseline, and cost baseline.
                  In earned value management (EVM), there are several variables based on three fun-
                  damental parameters--namely, actual cost (AC), earned value (EV), and planned
                  (PV)--that are used to compare the actual project progress to the planned progress
                  in order to make performance measurements.

Summary
   You need to monitor and control your project throughout its lifecycle, which includes moni-
   toring and controlling performance. In an ideal world, there should be no changes to or vari-
   ations from the planned baselines, such as cost, schedule, and scope baselines. A good-quality
   project is completed within the planned cost, schedule, and scope. However, in the real world,
   there are changes and variations, and therefore quality needs to be monitored and controlled,
   which involves monitoring certain project results by making measurements and taking actions
   based on those measurements.
   The three project parameters--cost, scope, and schedule--are collectively known as a triple con-
   straint because if one of them changes, at least one of the other two parameters must change.
   Therefore, project monitoring and controlling includes monitoring and controlling these three
   parameters, which involves measuring cost, schedule, and scope performance and taking actions
   based on performance. The most commonly used technique to measure cost and schedule per-
   formance is known as the earned value technique (EVT), also called earned value management
   (EVM), and it measures performance by comparing the earned value of the actual work per-
   formed to the actual cost and to the planned value that was supposed to be earned according
   to the plan. You incur cost in executing the scheduled work. So performance is also measured
   in terms of performed work or schedule performance.
   After the execution of the last schedule activity is complete, you are not finished yet. You need
   to give proper closure to the project, which is the topic I discuss in the next section of this book.


   Exam's Eye View
    Comprehend

     Monitoring and controlling includes monitoring and controlling project performance.
     The three project parameters--cost, schedule, and scope--form a triple constraint, which
        means if one of these three parameters changes, at least one of the other two must change.

     Performance baselines and work performance information are the common inputs to monitor-
        ing and controlling the scope, schedule, and cost, and work performance measurements and
        change requests are the common outputs.

     Project performance is measured by comparing the work performance information from the
        project execution to the performance measurement baseline: scope baseline, schedule baseline,
        and cost baseline.
366   Part IV       MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT


         Look Out

          Planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual cost (AC) are the three key parameters that
            need to be monitored closely. The rest of the earned value analysis is based on these three fun-
            damental parameters.

          Cost variance (CV) is calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the earned value
            (EV), and not from the planned value (PV).

          Schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are calculated in terms of cost:
            EV and PV.

          It is possible for CV and SV to run in opposite directions--for example, CV has a positive
            value when SV has a negative value.

          The total planned value (PV) of the project is the same as the budget at completion (BAC).

         Memorize

          For cost performance analysis:
                EV=BACx(Work completed/Total work required)

                CV=EV-AC

                CPI=EV/AC

          For schedule performance analysis:
                PV=BACx(Time passed/Total schedule time)

                SV=EV-PV

                SPI=EV/PV

                EAC at the budgeted rate=AC+BAC-EV

Key Terms and Definitions
       actual cost (AC). The total cost actually incurred until a specific point on the
       timescale in performing the work for a project or a project activity.
       budget at completion (BAC). The total budget authorized for performing the pro-
       ject work. This is the planned budget for the project, the cost that you originally
       estimated for the project.
       change control system. A collection of formal documented procedures that specifies
       how the project deliverables and documents will be changed, controlled, and
       approved.
       cost baseline. The planned budget for the project over a time period, used as a basis
       against which to monitor, control, and measure the cost performance of the project.
       The cost performance is measured by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost
       over a time period.
       cost performance index (CPI). A measure of the cost efficiency of a project calcu-
       lated by dividing earned value (EV) by actual cost (AC).
       cost variance (CV). A measure of cost performance obtained by subtracting actual
       value (AC) from earned value (EV). A positive result indicates good performance,
       whereas a negative result indicates bad performance.
       earned value (EV) or budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP). The value of the
       actually performed work expressed in terms of the approved budget for a project or a
       project activity for a given time period.

       ment methodology and a technique to measure project progress by comparing inte-
       grated measures of scope, schedule, and cost with the planned performance baseline.
       estimate at completion (EAC) at budgeted rate. The estimate from the current
       point in time of how much it will cost to complete the entire project or an entire
       project activity for which the BAC is given. The value of EAC is obtained by adding
       the value of ETC at the budgeted rate to AC.
       estimate at completion (EAC) at current CPI. The estimate from the current point
       in time of how much it will cost to complete the entire project or an entire project
       activity for which the BAC is given. The value of EAC is obtained by adding the
       value of ETC at the current CPI to AC.
       estimate to complete (ETC) at budgeted rate. The expected cost, estimated by
       assuming the future performance will be at the budgeted rate, to complete the
       remaining work for the project or for a project activity.
       estimate to complete (ETC) at present CPI. The expected cost, estimated by
       assuming the future performance will be at the current CPI, to complete the remain-
       ing work for the project or for a project activity.

                the approval process, such as the integrated change control process.
                schedule baseline. A specific version of the project schedule developed from the
                schedule network analysis and the schedule model data. This is the approved version
                of the schedule with a start date and an end date, and it is used as a basis against
                which the project schedule performance is measured.
                schedule performance index (SPI). A measure of the schedule efficiency of a project
                calculated by dividing earned value (EV) by planned value (PV).
                schedule revision. An update to the project schedule that includes changing the
                project start date, end date, or both.
                scope baseline. The approved project scope, which includes the approved project
                scope statement, the WBS based on the approved project scope statement, and the
                corresponding WBS dictionary.
                variance. A measurable deviation in the value of a project variable, such as cost from
                a known baseline or expected value.
                variance analysis. A technique used to assess the magnitude of variation in the value
                of a variable (such as cost from the baseline or expected value), determine the cause
                of the variance, and decide whether a corrective action is required.



   Review Questions
          1.     You are the project manager for a software product, and your project is in the execu-
                 tion stage. You have learned that Maya, a developer, has started adding some new fea-
                 tures to the deliverable she is working on. What is the best action for you to take?
                   A. Tell Maya to delete the code corresponding to these features because this is a
                        scope creep, and scope creeps are not allowed.
                   B. Learn from Maya what those features are and how much time they will take
                        and then make necessary updates to the WBS, the WBS dictionary, and the
                        schedule. Also tell Maya that in the future she should get approval from you
                        before adding any new features.
                   C. Determine where the request for the new features came from and process the
                        change request through the integrated change request process.
                   D. Contact Maya's functional manager and ask the manager to replace Maya with
                        another developer.

PART
       V Closing
       the Project
    o most of us, it may be common sense that every start has a finish. A project
T   that has been started will have a finish. As I explained in Chapter 1, people have
been doing projects even when there was no field of project management. The
underlying philosophy of project management is to perform projects deliberately--
that is, to plan them and to monitor and control them. Finishing a project deliber-
ately means finishing it in a controlled way, not just letting it finish--even when it's
cancelled.
There are three main elements of a successful project closure: final verification of
the project deliverables by the project team, verification and acceptance of the
deliverables that were procured, and acceptance of project deliverables by the
appropriate party, such as the customer or the sponsor. This includes proper closure
of all the legal contracts.
While we are talking about closure, this part of the book is also a good place to
remind ourselves of our professional and social responsibilities as project manage-
ment practitioners.

Introduction
  The last deliverable on the project schedule has been completed, and you think that the pro-
  ject has been a big success. However, put that champagne bottle back into the refrigerator; the
  project has not ended yet. It has just reached another stage called the project closing stage, and,
  as a project manager, you need to continue monitoring and controlling the project through this
  stage. Also, recall that there are two kinds of project work--in house and procured. So you need
  to put a closure on the procured component of the project and then run the procured deliver-
  ables through the project closure process. The deliverables developed in house should be veri-
  fied to check whether they meet the scope before running them through the closure process.
  In other words, what was planned to be done has actually been done. So that nothing falls
  between the cracks and for legal reasons, you need to formally close the project. This involves
  finalizing all the project and project management activities and giving them a proper closure.
  You should do this even when the project is being terminated before the planned finish line.
  After all the planned deliverables--developed in house and procured--have been verified, the
  project should be closed with the acceptance of the deliverables by the appropriate party and
  by archiving the appropriate documents.
  So, the core issue in this chapter is how to properly close a project. In search of an answer, we
  will explore three avenues: verifying the scope of project deliverables, closing procurements, and
  closing the project.



Closing the Project: Big Picture
  Project closure refers to a set of tasks that are required to formally end the project. There are
  two kinds of projects that you need to close formally:
       Completed projects. A project that has met its completion criteria falls into this
       category.
       Terminated projects. A project that was terminated before its completion falls into
       this category. A project can be terminated at various stages for various reasons. Fol-
       lowing are some examples:
        The project management plan is not approved for whatever reason.
        The project has been executing, but you have run out of resources, and no more
           resources are available.
        The project has been cancelled because it was going nowhere.
        The project has been indefinitely postponed because there is not a large enough
           market for the product it would produce.
376   Part V         CLOSING THE PROJECT



                       NOTE
                The processes of the closing process group can be used to close a project, as well
                as to close a phase of a project.


       A project, in general, may have in-house activities--that is, project activities being performed
       within the performing organization--and procurement activities. Accordingly, there are two
       aspects of project closure:
                Close the in-house activities of the project.
                Close the procurement part of the project.
       Project closure includes the following activities:
                Activities to verify that all deliverables have been provided and accepted
                Activities to confirm that all the project requirements, including stakeholder require-
                ments, have been met
                Activities to verify that the completion or exit criteria have been met
                Activities to ensure that the project product is transferred to the right individual or
                group
                Activities to review the project for lessons learned and archive the project records
       You need to obtain final closure, such as acceptance signoffs, contract closure, or receipts for
       both the in-house part and the procurement part of the project and from both internal and
       external vendors and customers. You perform this task by using standard accounting practices
       and following the relevant organizational and legal procedures, such as SOX compliance.


                       NOTE
                SOX refers to The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, also known as the Public Company
                Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002. It is a United States Federal
                law enacted on July 30, 2002, in response to a number of major corporate and
                accounting scandals that affected companies such as Enron and WorldCom. These
                scandals cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies
                collapsed and therefore shook public confidence in the nation's securities markets.



       Figure 13.1 presents the big picture of project closure in a nutshell:
          1.     Verify the scope of the project deliverables developed in house.
          2.     Accept the procured deliverables through the procurement closure process.

  3. Get the deliverables from Step 1 and Step 2 and get them accepted by the customer
     or sponsor to actually close the project.
  4. Archive the project documents.

In the following sections we discuss details of these steps in terms of the processes shown in
Table 13.1.

In a nutshell, all the aspects of the project closure should be covered, such as financial closure,
legal closure, and administrative closure, with all the relevant parties, such as vendors and cus-
tomers external and internal to the performing organization.
Before closure begins, the project deliverables must be checked for their scope.
378   Part V        CLOSING THE PROJECT



   Verifying the Scope of Project
   Deliverables
       Verifying scope is the process of formally accepting the completed project deliverables. Before
       you hand over the project deliverables to the appropriate party mentioned in the project man-
       agement plan, such as the customer or the sponsor, you need to verify that these deliverables
       actually meet the planned scope. So, verifying the scope of the project deliverables includes
       reviewing deliverables to ensure that all of them are completed as planned and therefore as
       expected.


                     CAUTION
               You should perform the scope verification process even if the project is terminated--
               that is, ended before completion. In that case you would verify and document the
               level and extent of the project and product scope that was completed.



       The process used to verify the scope is called Verify Scope and is illustrated in Figure 13.2. To
       verify the scope of deliverables, you need to pull out the project management plan and look at
       the sections related to the planned scope: the project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dic-
       tionary. The project scope statement includes the list of deliverables, the product scope descrip-
       tion, and the product acceptance criteria. More scope-related details can be found in the
       WBS, which defines the decomposition of each deliverable into work packages. Further details,
       such as a description of each WBS component, the related statement of work, and technical
       requirements, can be found in the WBS dictionary.




           FIGURE 13.2 The Verify Scope process: input, tools and techniques, and output.
                                           CLOSING THE PROJECT                     Chapter 13           379


STUDY CHECKPOINT 13.1
Before you begin the Verify Scope process, you look at the project scope statement, WBS, and
WBS dictionary. What are these three elements collectively called?



    The product requirements should be considered part of the scope and can be found in two
    documents: the stakeholder requirements document and the requirements traceability matrix
    that you prepared in the process of collecting requirements during the planning stage of the
    project. Finally, before you go through the process of scope verification, you should get all the
    deliverables validated through the quality control process. You can use inspection or auditing
    on the deliverables if necessary, even in the Verify Scope process.
    The actual scope verification activity has different names in different organizations, such as
    audits, inspection, product review, and walkthrough. Nevertheless, the output of this activity is
    documentation of two kinds:
          Documentation of which deliverables have been accepted--that is, verified.
          Documentation of those deliverables that have not passed verification and therefore
          are not accepted. Also, documentation of the reasons why they failed the verifica-
          tion.
    The scope verification process may also give rise to change requests, such as requests for defect
    repairs.


                 CAUTION
          Do not confuse scope verification with quality control. Quality control is primarily
          focused on checking the correctness of the deliverables and other quality require-
          ments, whereas scope verification is primarily concerned with overall acceptance of
          the project deliverables. Quality control is usually performed before scope verification,
          but they can be performed simultaneously as well, depending on the situation.



STUDY CHECKPOINT 13.2
The Verify Scope process belongs to which process group?



    The project deliverables that have been accepted through the scope verification process still
    need to go through final acceptance by the appropriate party, such as the customer or the
    sponsor.
380   Part V      CLOSING THE PROJECT



   Performing Project Closure
       Closing the project means finalizing all activities across the project. You also need to deter-
       mine and coordinate the procedures required for verifying and documenting the project deliv-
       erables. The items that describe what the project was planned to deliver and what it has
       delivered would be the obvious inputs to the process of closing the project. The formal name
       of the project closure process is Close Project or Phase, because it can also be used to close a
       phase in a multi-phase project. The process is illustrated in Figure 13.3 with its input, tools
       and techniques, and output.




           FIGURE 13.3 The Close Project or Phase process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


   Input to the Close Project Process
       You need a list of project deliverables that will go through the acceptance procedure. The pro-
       ject management plan contains guidelines on how to close the project. These and other input
       items are discussed in the following list.
            Project management plan. This defines how to close the project and will be useful
            in establishing the project closure procedure. The project management plan is also
            used in verifying and accepting the project deliverables because it explains what
            deliverables are expected.
            Accepted deliverables. These are the deliverables that have been verified through
            the scope verification process. That means these deliverables meet the scope require-
            ments. This includes the deliverables from procurements that have been accepted
            through the procurement closure process.
            Organizational process assets. These can include project closure guidelines or
            requirements--for example, product validation and acceptance criteria, final project
            audits, and project evaluations. Also, you can learn from the historical information
            what kind of project documents you need to archive and in what detail you want to
            review the project to gather and store lessons learned. Your organization may also
            have transition criteria or a procedure on handing the product of the project to the
            appropriate party.

     These input items provide information about what the project was supposed to deliver and
     what it has delivered. You use this input and some tools and techniques to carry on the project
     closure.
     For example, you can use expert judgment in the various aspects of project closure, such as
     developing the closure procedures and ensuring that the closure procedures are performed to
     meet the appropriate standards. You can also use the project management information system
     to perform closure activities, such as archiving the project documents.


 STUDY CHECKPOINT 13.3
 What is the standard name for the process used to close a phase of a project?


     You use these tools to carry on the project closure.


                 CAUTION
           The formal name of the process to close the project or a phase of it is Close Project or
           Phase. However, like other processes, we also refer to it by informal names, such as
           close project or project closure. You should not expect that the exam will always refer
           to the processes by their formal names. You should know the formal name of each
           process and then be able to recognize when it's being referred to in an informal way.




Output of the Close Project Process
     Project closure accomplishes three main elements--completing all the closing procedures;
     achieving final acceptance of the project deliverables by the customer, including handing over
     the deliverables to the appropriate party; and archiving project-related documents. These ele-
     ments are described in the following paragraphs.
     Final delivery and transition. This means that the project product or output has been deliv-
     ered and transitioned (handed over) to the appropriate party. This includes getting formal
     acceptance for the product--for example, in the form of a receipt that contains a formal state-
     ment to the effect that the requirements of the project have been met, including the terms of
     the contracts. One last time, make sure the following activities have been completed:
           Activities to define the requirements for getting approval from the stakeholders, such
           as customers and the sponsor, on the project deliverables and the approved changes
           that were supposed to be implemented
           Activities that are necessary to satisfy the project completion or exit criteria
382     Part V        CLOSING THE PROJECT


                Activities related to the project completion, such as:
                 Confirming that the project has met all requirements
                 Verifying that all deliverables have been provided and accepted
                 Verifying that the completion or exit criteria have been met
           Updates to organizational process assets. The closure process will add the following docu-
           ments to the organizational process assets:
                Acceptance documentation. This is the documentation that proves the fulfillment
                of the project requirements have been confirmed, completion of the project has been
                verified, and the product has been formally accepted by the customer. In the case of
                a project termination, of course, the documentation should show that the exit criteria
                have been met.
                Project closure documentation. In addition to the acceptance documentation, you
                should also archive the other project closure documents, such as the closure proce-
                dure and the handing-over of project deliverables to an operations group. If the pro-
                ject was terminated, then the formal documentation indicating why the project was
                terminated should be included in the archive.
                Project files archive. This includes the documents from the project's lifecycle, such
                as the project management plan, risk registers, planned risk responses, and baselines
                for cost, schedule, scope, and quality.
                Lessons-learned database. The documentation on lessons learned should be saved
                in the organization's knowledge database so that future projects can benefit from it.


      STUDY CHECKPOINT 13.4
      True or False: You do not need to follow the Close Project process if the project is terminated at
      a rather early stage.



           The deliverables that are processed through the project closure include the deliverables from
           procurements that are accepted through the procurement closure process. Therefore, in order
           to complete the project closure, you need to perform the procurement closure.



   Performing Procurement Closure
           A project might include work that was procured. Performing procurement closure means com-
           pleting each procurement and giving it a proper closure. Project closure is not complete with-
           out procurement closure.
                                           CLOSING THE PROJECT                      Chapter 13       383


   All the procurement contracts are closed at the end of a project or a phase by using the con-
   tract closure procedure. Procurement closure accomplishes the following two major goals:
        Close all the contracts applicable to the project.
        Receive verification (if you are a seller) or issue verification (if you are a buyer) that
        all the procured deliverables were received and accepted. In this respect, the contract
        closure process supports the administrative closure of the project.
   If the project terminates without completion, you still need to go through the contract closure
   procedure, if there is a contract. Usually, a contract contains the contract termination clause,
   which contains the terms of the project termination, including the rights and responsibilities
   of the parties in case of the project's early termination.
   The Close Procurements process is illustrated in Figure 13.4 with its input, tools and tech-
   niques, and output.




       FIGURE 13.4 The Close Procurements process: input, tools and techniques, and output.


Input to Closing Procurements
   The input items to the contract closure process are what you need to close the contract. They
   are discussed in the following list:
        Procurement management plan. This is needed to check whether the procurement
        requirements are met; it might have some procedures that you need to follow during
        closure.
        Procurement documentation. You need all the procurement documentation at this
        time for two purposes: You want to close the procurements according to the require-
        ments in the procurement documents, and you want to archive the documentation.
   The procurement management plan may contain a contract closure procedure developed to for-
   mally close all contracts associated with the project. It specifies a step-by-step methodology to
   execute activities needed to close the contracts. The roles and responsibilities of the team mem-
   bers who will be involved in the closure process are also specified.
384   Part V        CLOSING THE PROJECT



                     CAUTION
               A procedure and a process are not the same thing. For example, an organization
               may have a procedure to implement processes, such as first verify that the process is
               required, then collect all the input to the process before starting it, and so on.



       You implement the procurement closure process by using the available tools and techniques,
       discussed in the next section.


   Tools and Techniques for Closing Procurements
       The tools and techniques for the contract closure process are the items you need to facilitate
       contract closure. They are discussed in the following paragraphs.
       Procurement audits. This is a structured review of the procurement process with the purpose
       of identifying successes and failures from the planning through the executing stage of the pro-
       ject. The lessons learned from the audit can be applied to other phases of the same project (if
       it is a phase closeout) or to other projects within the same performing organization.
       Settlement negotiations. Negotiations are a tool, a technique, and a skill that become very use-
       ful during the procurement closure process. Negotiations are used to give a proper closure
       through settlements to all outstanding claims, issues, and disputes. If direct negotiations fail,
       the option of some kind of mediation or arbitration should be explored. Obviously, the legal
       department of your organization should be involved here.
       Records management system. This is a part of the project management information system
       and can be used to manage contract documentation and records. For example, you can use this
       system to archive documents, maintain an index of contract and communication documents,
       and retrieve documents.


   Output of Closing Procurements
       The obvious output of closing procurements is the closed procurements. This and other out-
       put items are discussed here.
       Procurement closure. Procurement closure means the procured work is completed with all its
       requirements and is accepted. Generally, it is accomplished by a formal notice from the buyer
       to the seller, which might come, for example, through the buyer's authorized administrator. The
       requirements for formal contract closure are usually defined in the terms of the contract and
       are included in the procurement management plan.

   Updates to organizational process assets. The following items should be added to the orga-
   nizational process assets:
        Procurement documentation. This includes all the procurement documents, includ-
        ing the procurement management plan, closed contracts, and the procurement clo-
        sure notice. These documents should be archived.
        Acceptance notice. This notice formally acknowledges the acceptance of deliverables
        through a notice from the buyer to the seller, notifying that the procurement deliver-
        ables have been accepted. This is an important document and should be preserved.
        Lessons learned. The procurement experience for this project should be analyzed,
        and the lessons learned should be gathered, recorded, and archived so that future
        projects can benefit from them.
   Some important elements that are usually part of the details of project closure are discussed in
   more detail in the next section.



The Finishing Touch
   Reviewing the project, releasing the project resources, and turning over the project deliverables
   to another group are the elements of the administrative aspect of project closure that need to
   be explored further.


Reviewing the Project
   Part of the details of project closure is to analyze project success or failure. You can accomplish
   this by collecting and generating project evaluation information, such as what went well and
   what did not. Some of this information already exists in the work performance reports. How-
   ever, the final information can be gathered in various ways, such as a post-project review meet-
   ing with the team or a questionnaire. The most important output (and the whole purpose) of
   the review is the lessons learned. The review should be comprehensive and should cover the
   following:
        Both technical and nontechnical components
        Both positive and negative aspects--that is, the things that went well and the things
        that did not go well
        All stages and phases of the project



                TIP
         The purpose of the post-project review, also called the post-project assessment, is to
         learn lessons that can be applied to future projects to run them more effectively. Do
         not let the review turn into a finger-pointing show.
386   Part V      CLOSING THE PROJECT


       As part of the project review, you should also measure customer satisfaction from the customer
       feedback collected by using techniques such as interviews and surveys. This will help the orga-
       nization establish and maintain a long-term relationship with the customer. An example of a
       survey is a 360-degree survey, which means feedback from all kinds of stakeholders in the pro-
       ject. In general, a 360-degree survey contains feedback from all around the entity being eval-
       uated. For example, a 360-degree evaluation of an employee's performance will be based on
       feedback from the employee's peers, supervisors, customers that the employee deals with, other
       employees that this employee may be managing, and self-evaluation.
       The findings of the review should be recorded in a document that might have different names
       in different organizations, such as the post-project review report or the project assessment report.
       Your organization might even have a template or standard for such a report. Depending upon
       the size of the project, the review report might be part of the project closure report or a sepa-
       rate report. The report will be distributed among the stakeholders and will be added to the
       project archive. The project closure report can also include the final project performance as
       compared to the baselines, as well as a description of the final project product.


   Releasing the Resources
       For effective and efficient use of the organization's resources, it is imperative that they be
       released in an efficient and proper manner. The release procedure might be included in the
       resource planning--for example, the staff management plan should address the issue of releas-
       ing the human resources. Well-planned release or transfer of team members reflects manage-
       rial professionalism, which requires that employees be treated with respect and dignity. By
       ensuring a well-planned release and a smooth transition to other projects, you are helping the
       employees focus wholeheartedly on the project toward the very end, rather than worrying about
       the next assignment. This will obviously improve the productivity of team members and the
       efficiency of the project. Following are some suggestions to consider for properly releasing
       human resources:
            Although it is possible that different team members will be released at different
            times, at the project closure you should organize some closure event to honor and
            thank the project team members, including the contractors, for their contributions.
            However, you must check your company policy regarding including contractors in
            company-sponsored events and giving them rewards.
            Plan ahead and do not wait until the last minute. Communicate with the functional
            manager ahead of time about when a staff member is going to be released.
            Work closely with your organization's human resources department, which might
            have some guidelines or procedures that you need to follow.
            Write (or offer to write) recommendation letters for team members who have made
            outstanding contributions to the project.
       Once all the closure tasks are completed and the documents are finalized, the project might
       need to be turned over to another group in the organization--for example, to the maintenance
       or operations group.
                                          CLOSING THE PROJECT                    Chapter 13       387


Saying Goodbye: The Project Turnover
   Depending upon the project, you might need to coordinate the turnover of the project deliv-
   erables to the customer or to another group in your organization, such as a maintenance or
   operations group. The turnover requirements, such as training help-desk employees, should
   have been included in the project management plan.



               TIP
         Although the standard project processes are the same for each organization, the
         details and the manners in which they are implemented might be different for different
         organizations. Each organization can develop its own implementation details, which
         consist of items such as detailed steps for how to carry on the project processes,
         templates, meetings, and procedures.



   The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
        The project deliverables validated through the quality control process must go
        through the Verify Scope process to ensure that the planned scope has been met.
        The deliverables acquired through procurement must go through the procurement
        closure process for acceptance by the appropriate party, such as the project manager.
        The deliverables verified through the Verify Scope process and the deliverables
        accepted through the procurement closure process must go through the project clo-
        sure process for acceptance by the appropriate party.



Summary
   All projects, big or small, terminated or completed, should go through the closure stage, which
   involves the closure of both parts of the project: in house and procurements. The project deliv-
   erables validated through the quality control process are verified for their scope through the
   Verify Scope process. These verified deliverables go through the project closure process for
   acceptance by the appropriate party, such as the customer or the project sponsor. The same
   process is used to close a project or a phase of it and is formally called the Close Project or
   Phase process. If the project has a procurement component, the products from procurement
   must first go through the procurement closure process for acceptance by the project manager
   or other authorized party, and then the accepted product must go through the project closure
   process for acceptance by the appropriate party, such as the customer or the project sponsor.
   Like every other profession, project management has its integrity and ethics that you need to
   uphold. You'll explore this topic in the next chapter.
388   Part V          CLOSING THE PROJECT


       Exam's Eye View
         Comprehend

          You, the project manager, manage the project closure. You can even recommend project closure
               to the project sponsor--for example, if you run out of resources and no more resources are
               available--but the authorization for the project closure must come from the sponsor.

          Before going through project closure, the deliverables must be checked for their scope through
               the Verify Scope process.

          Before going through the Verify Scope process, the project deliverables must be validated
               through the Perform Quality Control process.

          The project, in general, can have two kinds of work--in house and procured. Accordingly,
               there are two components of closure--project closure and procurement closure.

          The deliverables accepted through the procurement closure process also go through the project
               closure process.

         Look Out

          Not only the completed projects, but also the terminated projects, must be formally closed
               using the processes of the closing process group.

          The Verify Scope process belongs to the monitoring and controlling process group.
          Verify Scope and Perform Quality Control are two different processes, even though both use
               inspection as a tool.

          The same process is used to close a phase of a project and the project itself.

         Memorize

          The project sponsor signs the final project closure documents. The sponsor can also authorize
               the closure of the project at any stage.

          The product acceptance is carried out using the Close Project or Phase process.
          The contracts are closed using the Close Procurements process.
          The contributions to the documentation archive, including the lessons-learned database, are
               made by both the Close Project or Phase and the Close Procurements processes.

              execution stage.
           B. A schedule activity on a critical path is way behind schedule, and there is no
              way you can meet the project finish date.
           C. The project was cancelled when it was in the middle of the executing stage.
           D. The project sponsor has withdrawn support for the project.

   2.     Your project has entered the closing stage, and you are planning for the project review.

                           ences. For all these objectives, you must understand
                           the Project Management Institute's Code of Ethics
                           and Professional Conduct based on four core val-
                           ues: fairness, honesty, respect, and responsibility.
Introduction
  As the name of the certification suggests, you are going to become a project management pro-
  fessional, if you are not one already. A professional is an individual who practices an occupa-
  tion with professionalism, which is a bond that binds a professional with the code of conduct
  for that occupation. Professionalism is not Einstein's theory of relativity. You might need to
  learn a few things in the beginning, but during the course of practicing a profession, profes-
  sional conduct (that is, professionalism) becomes common sense. All professions share the
  essence of professionalism. It is as simple as doing the right thing. As a project manager,
  remember one golden rule: Deal with unprofessional situations directly, openly, and fairly, rather
  than ignoring them. Professionalism starts with individual integrity, which is based on truth,
  honesty, and openness.
  Therefore, the key question in this chapter is, how can you practice project management with
  professional responsibility? In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues--individual
  integrity, interaction with clients and project stakeholders, and core values of ethical and pro-
  fessional conduct.



Ensuring Individual Integrity
  Professionalism begins with individual integrity, which is a state of being complete and incor-
  ruptible. You can look at integrity as a point of reference based on truth and honesty, and you
  can maintain your integrity by using this point of reference as a guideline for your behavior
  and decision-making. Integrity identifies you as who you are. You demonstrate integrity by tak-
  ing responsibility for your decisions and actions. If you don't have integrity, people won't know
  who you really are, and they won't trust you. So, individual integrity is a very significant part
  of professionalism in any profession.


               NOTE
        Sometime the term practitioner is also used to refer to a project management profes-
        sional. A project management practitioner is any individual who, as part of the project
        management profession, participates in an activity that contributes to the manage-
        ment of a project, program, or portfolio.
396     Part V       CLOSING THE PROJECT


          As a professional (the practitioner of a profession), you must set high standards, and you must
          aspire to meet those standards in all avenues of your life: while practicing the profession, at
          work, and at home. In that context, in project management, you maintain your integrity by
          being honest and truthful everywhere--for example, in the PMP exam, as well as while work-
          ing in the project management field.
          Dealing with the PMP exam and PMI. For example, while going through the process of
          obtaining PMP certification, individual integrity demands that it is your responsibility to
          adhere to the following practices:
                While going through the process of obtaining PMP certification, provide accurate
                and true information.
                Maintain the confidentiality of the content of the PMP examination. For example,
                do not disclose the questions in the exam to other PMP candidates.
                Cooperate with PMI concerning any ethical violation and in collecting related infor-
                mation.
          The same honesty, truthfulness, and openness that you exhibit during the process of obtaining
          PMP certification also applies while you are working in the field of project management.


      STUDY CHECKPOINT 14.1
      Does the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct only apply to the PMP certification and not to
      other certifications?



          Working in the project management field. The activities that you perform as a PMP include
          representing yourself as a PMP, advertising your organization and your services, and running
          projects. To maintain your individual integrity during these activities, it is your responsibility
          to adhere to the following practices:
                Be accurate and truthful in advertising and representing your qualifications, experi-
                ence, and the services you can perform.
                Be accurate and truthful to the public in advertising and public statements. For
                example, if your project is going to damage the environment, don't say it's going to
                help the environment.
                Maintain and satisfy the scope and objectives of the services promised to the
                customer.
                Follow the applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards of the city, state, and
                country of your workplace. For example, don't say something like, "This is not how
                we do it back in Texas."
                Neither offer nor accept inappropriate payments in any form, such as gifts, which
                might qualify as bribery.

              TIP
       When you are in a foreign country, sometimes it can be tricky to figure out the right
       thing to do in a given situation. The trick here is if you are being asked to do some-
       thing, such as pay some money to an official for getting something done, that is not
       legal or ethical in your country and culture, first investigate whether it is legal and eth-
       ical in the country you are in now. If you find it to be illegal and unethical there as
       well, but you are told it's a common practice, do not do it.



  As you practice project management, you will learn lessons you can share with the community
  of project managers--that is, you can contribute to the project management knowledge base.



Contributing to the Knowledge Base
  Professionalism demands (or encourages) that project managers (or PMPs) contribute to the
  project management knowledge base by publishing, teaching, and sharing lessons learned dur-
  ing practice. While doing so, you should adhere to the following practices:
       Share the information in an accurate, truthful, and complete manner.
       Recognize and honor the intellectual property developed or owned by others and
       give credit where credit is due when you use it.
       Follow the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by PMI and disseminate it
       among the PMP community.


              CAUTION
       PMI in general expects a PMP to stay engaged and help advance the project man-
       agement profession by completing tasks such as contributing to the knowledge base.
       So participating in project management training, mentoring, sharing lessons learned,
       and promoting best practices are all recommendations by PMI that might appear in
       some exam questions, even if you don't see them literally mentioned in the Code of
       Ethics and Professional Conduct.



  Contributing to the knowledge base is one side of the coin; the other side is obtaining knowl-
  edge or enhancing your individual professional competence.
398   Part V      CLOSING THE PROJECT



   Enhancing Individual Professional
   Competence
       Professionalism in project management, as in any other field, demands that while practicing
       your profession you continue to learn and grow professionally. This is important for your indi-
       vidual success and for the advancement of the profession. It enables you to continue delivering
       what you promise to your customers.
       Project management is a very involved and growing field. PMP certification and this book
       only introduce you to the field. For example, you can focus on any of the nine knowledge areas,
       such as risk management or quality management, and explore it further. Exploring the exist-
       ing dimensions further is one area of learning, and adding new dimensions is another. For
       example, how about managing virtual teams--that is, teams that are spread out geographi-
       cally? This new dimension in project management is quickly becoming an important and inte-
       gral part of the project management profession, even faster than PMI can digest.
       Exploring existing dimensions further and practicing new dimensions enhances your individ-
       ual professional competence, as well as enables you to contribute to the knowledge base.
       Working in the field will also expose your professional weaknesses, which you will need to work
       on. This is also an integral part of enhancing your individual professional competence.
       Whether you are enhancing your individual professional competence or contributing to the
       knowledge base, you are interacting with other members of your professional community.
       During the course of a project, the most important interaction is the interaction among pro-
       ject stakeholders.



   Promoting Interaction among
   Stakeholders
       A project manager needs to have a host of skills, and all of them are important. However, if
       I'm forced to name the most important skill a project manager must have and the most impor-
       tant activity a project manager should perform, the answer would be communication. On that
       note, as a project manager, it is your responsibility to facilitate interaction among the project
       stakeholders. You use communication for various purposes, such as to keep everybody on the
       same page regarding the status and issues of the project so there is no confusion or misunder-
       standing.
       While dealing with stakeholders and facilitating interaction among them, professionalism
       demands that you adhere to the following practices:
            Treat stakeholders with respect and show respect for cultural diversity.
            Be accurate and truthful when presenting services and preparing estimates for costs
            and expected results.
      PERFORMING PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY                                    Chapter 14         399


       Be open, honest, and fair in your dealings with stakeholders, especially when you are
       resolving an issue.
       Honor confidentiality for the information you collect during your interactions with
       stakeholders.
       Disclose to stakeholders (clients, customers, owners, or contractors) significant cir-
       cumstances that could be construed as conflicts of interest. It is your responsibility to
       ensure that a conflict of interest does not compromise the legitimate interests of a
       stakeholder and does not influence your professional judgments.



Dealing with Unprofessional Conduct
  Working as a project manager, you will encounter minor to serious unprofessional conduct from
  time to time. The key here is, again, to be honest, truthful, and open.



              TIP
        You might encounter small ethical violations, which might be painful to resolve. How-
        ever, as a professional, you should choose to address them instead of ignoring them,
        and you should address them openly, fairly, and in a timely fashion. Openly, however,
        does not necessarily mean you go on CNN; you talk directly to the appropriate party.



  As you already know, we live in a world of duality--good and bad, pleasure and pain, profes-
  sionalism and unprofessionalism, and the like, all living side by side. Scary! However, if you
  stick to your professionalism, then you do not need to be afraid of a lack of professionalism in
  others. Do not focus on the person; focus on the conduct and remember that the only weapon
  you have to defeat a lack of professionalism is professionalism. If you are unprofessional, you
  cannot defeat a lack of professionalism; you can only promote it.
  So, when you encounter a lack of professionalism, stay professional, focus on the issue and not
  on the person, maintain a smile on your face, and deal with the situation honestly, openly, and
  truthfully.



Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct: The Big Picture
  In this chapter, we have discussed all the elements of being ethical and professional as a pro-
  ject management practitioner. In this section, we summarize our discussion into a big picture.
  The formal name for the standard for ethical and professional behavior issued by PMI is the
400   Part V        CLOSING THE PROJECT


       Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. According to this standard, as shown in Table 14.1,
       the four pillars that make the foundation of professional conduct are fairness, honesty, respect,
       and responsibility. These four values, identified by PMI as the most important to the global
       project management community, are defined in the following list.
            Fairness is the act of making decisions and behaving impartially and objectively, free
            from favoritism, competing self-interest, and prejudice.
            Honesty is the policy to understand the truth based on facts and act in a truthful
            manner, both in communication and in conduct.
            Respect is the behavior of showing high regard for yourself, the people you are deal-
            ing with, and the resources entrusted to you. Resources entrusted to you may include
            human resources, money, and natural and environmental resources.
            Responsibility is an act of taking ownership for the decisions you make or fail to
            make, the actions you take or fail to take, and the consequences that result.
       These values are not only good human and professional duties, but also help in developing a
       good business. For example, an environment of respect fosters trust, confidence, and mutual
       cooperation that lead to performance excellence. In an environment where diverse perspectives
       and views are encouraged and valued, better solutions will be designed, which will increase the
       chances of project success.


                     CAUTION
               You should also consider the implications of the basic definitions of the four fundamental
               values. For example, respect for human resources also means caring about the repu-
               tation and safety of the human resources you are managing and other stakeholders.



       As shown in Table 14.1, each of these four values is exercised in two dimensions: aspirational
       and mandatory. The aspirational standard describes the conduct that we strive to uphold in the
       practice of project management. The mandatory standard establishes firm requirements and in
       some cases limits or prohibits practitioner behavior. Practitioners who do not conduct them-
       selves in accordance with these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures before PMI's
       Ethics Review Committee.


                     CAUTION
               Do not confuse aspirational with optional. An aspirational standard is called aspira-
               tional because adherence to this standard is not an easy measure. That said, you are
               expected to comply with this standard as a professional: It is not optional.

                          NOTE
                  The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by PMI applies to anyone who meets
                  at least one of the following criteria:
                       * Is a member of PMI
                       * Holds a PMI certification or has applied to start the certification process

  So, let's conclude this final chapter with the mantra of our profession: fairness, honesty, respect,
  and responsibility.
  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
       You should practice your profession with professionalism, supported by individual
       integrity based on honesty, truthfulness, and openness.
       You should continue enhancing your professional competence and contributing to
       the project management knowledge base.
       The four values that make up the foundation of professional conduct are fairness,
       honesty, respect, and responsibility.



Summary
  As a PMP, you must practice project management with professionalism--that is, with profes-
  sional responsibility--which includes following the rules and policies of the certification process
  and of the organization for which you are managing the project. The key to professionalism is
  individual integrity based on honesty, truth, and openness. Professionalism requires that you
  interact with your client and with the project stakeholders with mutual dignity and respect and
  show respect to diversity of cultures and beliefs. If you encounter an unprofessional situation,
  rather than ignoring it, you deal with it honestly, openly, and truthfully. Your professional
  responsibility as a PMP also demands that you continue enhancing your professional compe-
  tence and contributing to the project management knowledge base.
  Keep in mind that while honesty, truth, and openness are essential elements of individual
  integrity regardless of where you are, the definitions of right versus wrong, acceptable versus
  unacceptable, and to some extent ethical versus unethical might vary across cultures. Some-
  times you will need to think hard to do the right thing when faced with tricky situations. For
  example, just because bribery is a common and acceptable practice in a country, that does not
  make it the right thing to do, especially if it is illegal. When you are not sure which option is
  the right one, investigate whether it is legal and ethical in that country.
  With individual integrity, you follow the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by PMI,
  which is founded on four fundamental values: fairness, honesty, respect, and responsibility.
404   Part V          CLOSING THE PROJECT


       Exam's Eye View
         Comprehend

          Honesty, truthfulness, and openness define integrity, which is the key to professionalism.
          While managing a project, you will perform the selected process for the project and will not
               cut corners--for example, to save money. A process is in place for the overall efficiency of the
               project, not as a formality.

          If an option sounds sneaky, manipulative, and as if it favors one stakeholder over another, it is
               not the option you want to choose.

          Disclose any conflict of interest to the relevant client and don't let this conflict influence your
               professional judgment.

         Look Out

          Do not do something that is illegal, unethical, or both in the country and culture of your
               workplace, even if it is legal and ethical back home.

          Do not do something that is illegal, ethical, or both, even if you are told that it is a common
               and acceptable practice.

          When you encounter an unprofessional attitude or situation, deal with it quickly, honestly, and
               openly, even when it is hard to do so and easy to ignore the problem.

          Beware of the options that offer you easier ways out or shortcuts. Those options are usually
               wrong.

          Showing respect to other cultures does not mean getting involved in something illegal.

         Memorize

          Follow the law of the land for your workplace.
          Show respect to other individuals and cultures.
          Honor the confidentiality of information that you learn during the course of getting certified,
               dealing with customers, and managing projects.

          Help advance the profession of project management by enhancing your individual professional
               competence and by contributing to the project management knowledge base.

          The four values that make up the foundation of professional conduct are fairness, honesty,
               respect, and responsibility.

Review Questions
   1.     You have applied for the PMP exam, and you are attending a training session for the
          exam offered by a PMP who proudly poses a number of questions to the audience and
          claims that these are the questions in the real exam. What should you do? (Choose
          one.)
            A. Immediately leave the classroom and never take another course from the same
                training agency.
            B. Write to the president of the training agency.
            C. Report this trainer to the police.
            D. Contact PMI and inform them of the situation.

   2.     You are managing a project in a country foreign to you. The project sponsor asks you
          to write a check to a city official to get some paperwork required for the project mov-
          ing forward. Such an activity in your home country would be considered bribery,
          which is illegal. What should you do?
            A. Investigate whether what the sponsor is suggesting is legal and ethical in this
                country.
            B. Report the sponsor to the police.
            C. Write the check to the city official because the project sponsor asked you to do so.
            D. Tell the sponsor that he's an unethical person and you are leaving the project.
406   Part V       CLOSING THE PROJECT


          3.   You are managing a project in a country foreign to you. The project sponsor asks
               you to write a check to a city official to get some paperwork required for the project
               moving forward. She confesses that it is, as a matter of fact, bribery and is technically
               illegal, but it is a very common and acceptable practice in this country. What should
               you do?
                 A. Go ahead and do it.
                 B. Tell the project sponsor politely that because it is illegal, you cannot do it.
                 C. Write an e-mail to the project sponsor's boss.
                 D. Tell the sponsor that she's an unethical person and you are leaving the project.

          4.   You are managing a project in a country foreign to you, and the project is in the plan-
               ning stage. The project sponsor asks you to inflate the cost estimate by 30 percent. He
               says, "We're not in Kansas anymore, buddy; if you want to get the license for a pistol
               here, you would have to apply for a machine gun." He insists that this is the only way
               he can get the required money because management always reduces the estimate
               before allotting money. Which of the following is the best step you could take?
                 A. Report the project sponsor to PMI.
                 B. Inflate the cost estimate as the sponsor said; after all, he is the sponsor.
                 C. Prepare an accurate estimate along with a risk report that explains the risks
                      involved if the adequate funds are not available.
                 D. Prepare two cost estimates--one for the management and another one for actual
                      implementation.

          5.   You are the project manager of a project that needs to procure a bunch of activities as
               a subproject due to the lack of skills in the organization. Your sister-in-law owns a
               firm that specializes in the area of the activities that need to be procured. She has
               shown an interest in this procurement. Which of the following steps would be the
               best to take?
                 A. Allot this work to your sister-in-law. After all, her firm specializes in this area.
                 B. Allot this work to your sister-in-law and make sure you don't let your relation-
                     ship affect your professional judgment.
                 C. Disclose your relationship with your sister-in-law to the stakeholders and allow
                     multiple vendors to bid for the opportunity. Excuse yourself from the final deci-
                     sion-making.

  What is the core difference between knowledge areas and process groups? Try to answer this
  question in one sentence.
  Answer: Knowledge areas are disciplines of management that represent management knowl-
  edge in a certain topic, such as cost and time, whereas process groups are about the appli-
  cation of that knowledge--that is, where and when to apply that knowledge, for example
  during initiating or during planning, and so on.
  Okay, that was a long sentence. Here is the short answer: Knowledge areas are about knowl-
  edge on project management topics, and process groups are about applying that knowledge.

What is the core difference between enterprise environmental factors and organizational
process assets?
Answer: Enterprise environmental factors are about how the performing organization does its
business, whereas organizational process assets are about how the organization runs its projects.
Explanation: Enterprise environmental factors are the factors of the overall environment in
which the organization is operating, doing its business. Organizational process assets are the
process-related assets, and the projects are made of processes; therefore, the organizational
process assets speak more to how the organization performs its projects.

    A. What is the difference between management control points and control accounts?
    B. What is the difference between control accounts and a code of accounts?

  Answers:
    A. Management control points are the nodes in the WBS hierarchical structures that are
       selected for managing some parameters or characteristics of the project. Control
       accounts are those management control points that are used to manage scope, budget,
       actual cost, and schedule. These three quantities are integrated and compared to
       earned value in order to measure project performance. In other words, a control
       account is an example of management control points.
    B. A code of accounts is a set of numbers or a numbering system used to uniquely iden-
       tify each component of the WBS. So, each component of the WBS can have a code
       of account, but each component is not a control account; only a few selected compo-
       nents are control accounts.

  You are trying out a Monte Carlo simulation program that estimates the value of a parameter
  by using some random variables. You know through the data that the exact value should be 50.
  You ran the program three times, and it gave you three values: 60, 61, and 62. Based on these
  values, answer the following questions:
    A. How precise is the program in making the estimates?
    B. How accurate are the estimates?
    C. Are the values generated by the program more accurate or more precise?
422   Part VI      APPENDIXES


       Answers:
         A. The program is quite precise because the values 60, 61, and 62 are very close to each
            other.
            Average value = 61
            % uncertainty = [(62-60)/61]x100%=3.3%
         B. The estimates are far away from the true value, and therefore accuracy is not very
            good.
            Average % deviation = [(61-50)/50]x100=22%
         C. Comparing the errors in parts A and B, the results are more precise and less accurate.

Answers and Explanations for
Chapter Review Questions

Chapter 1
   1.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because the defining characteristics of a project are that it
        must be temporary (with a start and finish date), and it must produce a unique
        (new) product.
        A and B are incorrect because it's possible to have a project that will involve only
        one person, and there could be a project without an individual called the project
        manager. The only two defining characteristics of a project are that it is temporary
        and unique.
        C is incorrect because an operation can have a plan and a budget, too.

   2.   Answer: B
        B is the correct answer because building a library is temporary--that is, it will have
        a start and a finish date, and it will be a new library.
        A, C, and D are incorrect because running a donut shop, keeping a network up and
        running, and running a warehouse are all ongoing operations.

   3.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because the names of the five process groups are initiating,
        planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.
        A, B, and C are incorrect because there are no process groups with the names of
        starting, organizing and preparing, or implementing.

   4.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because team management is not a knowledge area itself;
        this task is part of the knowledge area called human resource management.
        A, B, and C are incorrect because all these are three of the nine project manage-
        ment knowledge areas.
432   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          5.    Answer: A
                A is the correct and the best answer because the project plan is developed starting
                from the concept and going through progressive elaboration.
                B and C are incorrect because B includes the project lifecycle and C is the lifecycle.
                Progressive elaboration does not include the lifecycle of the project; its goal is to plan
                the project. Because the project planning can develop (or change) throughout the pro-
                ject lifecycle, progressive elaboration can continue through the project lifecycle, but it
                does not include the work of the lifecycle.

          6.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the projectized organization provides the greatest
                authority for the project manager.
                A and C are incorrect because the authority of the project manager is none to low in a
                functional organization and low to high in a matrix organization.
                D is incorrect because there is no organizational structure called leveled.

          7.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the authority of the project manager is none to low in
                a functional organization.
                B and C are incorrect because the authority of the project manager is high to full in a
                projectized organization and low to high in a matrix organization.
                D is incorrect because there is no organizational structure called leveled.

          8.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because:
                The probability that OTF will deliver = 3/4
                The probability that ST will deliver = 1-2/3 = 1/3
                The probability that both will deliver = 3/4x1/3=1/4=0.25

          9.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because it is false. Stakeholder influence is at its highest in the
                beginning of the project and decreases as the project progresses.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these are true statements.

         10.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because it's a false statement. Operations are usually ongoing
                and do not have a closure or end as a project does.
                A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements about both pro-
                jects and operations.

11.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because it sounds like a group of interrelated projects, which
      would nicely fit into a program.
      A is an incorrect answer because a project usually has only one project manager.
      C is incorrect because the undertaking is temporary and has a set of unique products.
      D is incorrect because a portfolio may contain projects and programs, and this conver-
      sation is being held at the program level and not at the portfolio level.

12.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because in addition to skills related to an application area and
      general management, an effective project manager must have knowledge, the ability to
      perform, and personal effectiveness.
      A, B, and D are incorrect because these options do not count all three necessary skills:
      knowledge, performance, and personal.

13.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because a weak matrix looks more like a functional organiza-
      tion in which a project manager is effectively a coordinator.
      A and B are incorrect because a strong matrix is closer to a projectized organization in
      which the project manager has full authority.
      D is incorrect because there is no organizational structure called hierarchical.

14.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because a project manager is responsible for achieving the
      project objectives regardless of the structure of the organization.
      A, B, and C are incorrect because the authority of the project manager may vary over
      structures, but the responsibility for meeting the project objectives stays with the pro-
      ject manager.

15.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because environmental factors may have positive or negative
      impacts on the project; for example, they may expand or constrain project options.
      A and B are incorrect because environmental factors may have positive or negative
      impacts.
      D is incorrect because environmental factors are hardly ever neutral. You must be
      aware of them and try to use them for the success of the project.

   Chapter 2
          1.    Answer: A
                A is correct because the management of the performing organization issues the pro-
                ject charter.
                B is incorrect because issuing a project charter is the responsibility of the performing
                organization, and a stakeholder does not even have to be a member of the performing
                organization.
                C is incorrect because issuing a project charter is the responsibility of the performing
                organization, and a customer does not even have to be a member of the performing
                organization.
                D is incorrect because the charter authorizes the project manager and not vice versa.

          2.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the project charter and stakeholder register are two
                documents that are the output of the initiating process group.
                A is incorrect because the statement of work is an input to the initiating process
                group and not a result (output) of it.
                C and D are incorrect because there are no standard documents called the scope plan
                or the preliminary project scope statement that are output of the initiating process
                group.

          3.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the project charter names the project manager and
                provides the project manager the authority to use organizational resources to run the
                project.
                A is incorrect because the sponsor is not authorized by the project charter; the oppo-
                site might be true.
                C and D are incorrect because these tasks are performed in the Identify Stakeholders
                process.

          4.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the project schedule is developed during planning.
                However, some milestone schedule may be included in the project charter.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because all these items may be included in the project char-
                ter.

5.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the approved project schedule is not available when
     you are performing the Identify Stakeholders process for the first time.
     A is incorrect because the project charter is a major input to identifying stakeholders.
     B and D are incorrect because a contract may be an input as part of the procurement
     documents, and the stakeholder register template may be an input as part of the orga-
     nizational process assets.

6.   Answer: A
     A is correct because the statement of work is an input to developing the project char-
     ter, which in turn is an input to identifying stakeholders.
     B is incorrect because the statement of work is an input to developing the project
     charter.
     C and D are incorrect because the project charter is an input to identifying stakehold-
     ers.

7.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because a hard deadline imposed on a project is an example of
     a constraint.
     A is incorrect because an assumption is a factor that you believe to be true; it is not a
     condition, such as a hard deadline.
     C is incorrect because a hard deadline tells very little about the actual schedule.
     D is incorrect because crashing is the process of assigning more resources to finish a
     project by a given deadline. Just because a deadline is given, that does not necessarily
     mean you need crashing.

8.   Answer: B
     B is correct because assumptions represent uncertainty and hence risk. Assumptions
     must be validated and analyzed as part of risk management at various stages of the
     project.
     A is incorrect because assumptions by definition represent uncertainty, and as a project
     manager, it is your responsibility to validate the assumptions at various stages of the
     project.
     C is incorrect because it is not the correct definition of assumption.
     D is incorrect because you can start the project with the assumptions. All you have to
     do is validate them at various stages of the project and analyze them as part of risk
     management.
436   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          9.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because enterprise environmental factors are input to various
                processes, but they do not constitute a specific project selection method.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because scoring models, benefit cost ratio, and constrained
                optimization methods are all project selection methods.

         10.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because adding parental guide notices is a business (legal)
                requirement.
                B is incorrect because adding these notices is not an opportunity to make revenue; it is
                a requirement that must be met to keep the website up without offending customers
                or the legal system.
                C and D are incorrect because the project at hand does not solve any organizational
                problem and is not launched to meet any internal organizational need.

         11.    Answer: D
                D is correct because the SOW references the business need, product scope descrip-
                tion, and strategic plan.
                A is incorrect because the SOW refers to product scope, which is not the same as pro-
                ject scope.
                B is incorrect because the SOW does not have to refer to human resources, and it
                may or may not refer to the contract.
                C is incorrect because the project manager may not even exist when the project char-
                ter is being developed.

         12.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the initiating process group generates the project char-
                ter, stakeholder register, and stakeholder management strategy.
                A is an incorrect answer because there is no standard document called the preliminary
                project scope statement that is generated during project initiating.
                C and D are incorrect answers because there are no standard documents called the
                detailed project scope statement and strategic plan that are generated during project
                initiating.

         13.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the Develop Project Charter process generates the
                project charter, and the Identify Stakeholders process generates the stakeholder regis-
                ter and stakeholder management strategy.
                B is incorrect because these are input items to the initiating process group.
                C is incorrect because there is no standard document named the preliminary scope
                statement that is produced during initiation.

Chapter 3
   1.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because work packages don't have to appear in the order the
        work will be performed. This sequencing will be done later.
        A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are the characteristics of the WBS.

   2.   Answer: D
        D is correct because the project charter is created in the initiation stage, and it is an
        input item to creating the requirements documentation and the scope statement.
        A is incorrect because the project charter is an input item into creating the project
        scope statement.
        B is incorrect because the project scope statement is an input item into creating the
        WBS.
        C is incorrect because the project charter is an input into creating the requirements
        documentation.

   3.   Answer: A
        A is correct because the Create WBS process is used to create the WBS.
        B is incorrect because the Define Scope process is used to create the project scope
        statement.
        C is incorrect because there is no standard process named Develop WBS.
        D is incorrect because project initiating is a process group that includes two processes
        to develop the project charter and to identify stakeholders.

   4.   Answer: B
        B is correct because the Define Scope process is used to create the project scope state-
        ment.
        A is incorrect because the Create WBS process is used to create the WBS.
        C is incorrect because there is no such standard process named Create Project Scope.
        D is incorrect because project initiating is a process group that includes two processes
        to develop the project charter and to identify stakeholders.

   5.   Answer: C
        C is the correct answer because the scope statement, the WBS document, and the
        WBS dictionary combined make the scope baseline against which all change requests
        will be evaluated.
        A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are true statements about the project scope
        management plan.
438   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          6.    Answer: A
                A is correct because the components in the lowest level of the WBS hierarchy are
                called work packages.
                B is incorrect because a milestone might consist of more than one work package.
                C is incorrect because if a phase is represented in the WBS, it will be represented at a
                much higher level.
                D is incorrect because a feature does not necessarily correspond to one work package.

          7.    Answer: D
                D is correct because the four limited resources, pre-imposed deadlines, and schedule
                milestones are good examples of common project constraints, and skill set is not.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because these are good examples of common constraints.

          8.    Answer: D
                D is correct because the scope statement, the WBS document, and the WBS dictio-
                nary combined make the scope baseline for the project.
                A is incorrect because the WBS dictionary is missing from the list.
                B is incorrect because you must include the WBS document and the WBS dictionary
                in the scope baseline.
                C is incorrect because you must include the scope statement and the WBS dictionary
                in the scope baseline.

          9.    Answer: D
                D is correct because you, the project manager, create the WBS with help from the
                project team.
                A is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with the help from the
                team.
                B and C are incorrect because neither the customer nor the upper management of the
                performing organization creates the WBS.

         10.    Answer: B
                B is correct because the WBS is not part of the project statement; it is an output of
                the Create WBS process, to which the scope statement is an input item.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are parts of the scope statement.

11.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because according to the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, the
      scope management plan is developed as part of the effort of developing the project
      management plan; there is no formal separate process for it.
      A is incorrect because the scope planning process does not exist in the Fourth Edition.
      B is incorrect because you need the scope management plan before you can perform
      the Define Scope process.
      D is incorrect because the scope management plan is developed during project plan-
      ning and not during project initiating.

12.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because job shadowing is another name for the observations
      technique for collecting requirements.
      A, C, and D are incorrect because job shadowing is not a standard tool or techniques
      for these processes.

13.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because the requirements documentation is an input to both
      the Define Scope process that generates the scope statement and the Create WBS
      process that generates the WBS.
      A, B, and C are incorrect because you must have the stakeholder register and the pro-
      ject charter before you can collect requirements.

14.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the project charter is an input to collecting require-
      ments, and the requirements are an input to creating the WBS.
      B is incorrect because the project charter is an input to collecting requirements.
      C is incorrect because requirements are an input to defining scope.
      D is incorrect because scope statement created by the Define Scope process is an
      input to creating the WBS.

15.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because the control account is the node in the WBS that is
      used to measure project performance by comparing the integrated schedule, scope,
      budget, and actual cost with the earned value.
      A is incorrect because the code of account is the number system used to uniquely
      identify each component of the WBS.
      C and D are incorrect because there are no standard terms called management
      account and performance node to refer to any node in the WBS.
440   Part VI        APPENDIXES



   Chapter 4
          1.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the precedence diagramming method is the most
                commonly used network diagramming method that can be used in the activity
                sequencing process to represent any of the four kinds of dependencies.
                A and B are incorrect because CPM and CCM are the network diagram analysis
                methods that are used in the schedule development process.
                D is incorrect because the arrow diagramming method is not the popular method.

          2.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because crashing is used to compress the schedule by adding
                more resources to the project.
                A and D are incorrect because the network diagramming method and the sequencing
                method do not need crashing.
                C is incorrect because crashing does not reduce cost. It may well increase cost when
                you commit additional resources.

          3.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because there are no float times on the critical path.
                B and C are incorrect because the critical path controls the finish date for a given start
                date and vice versa.
                D is incorrect because the critical path is the longest sequence, not the shortest.

          4.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because an activity has external dependency when it relies on
                factors outside the project.
                A is incorrect because Activity Y has a mandatory dependency on Activity X when Y
                inherently depends on X.
                C is incorrect because there is no such dependency called internal.
                D is incorrect because we have an external dependency here.

          5.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because finish-to-start dependency means that the successor
                (B) activity cannot start until the predecessor (A) activity is finished.
                A is incorrect because the start-to-finish relationship means that the successor activity
                cannot finish until the predecessor activity is started.
                C is incorrect because we do not have enough information to say that this dependency
                is mandatory.
                D is incorrect because although there is a dependency between two activities, that
                does not mean they are on the critical path.

6.   Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because each activity on the critical path has a zero float time,
     and therefore if an activity is delayed, it will delay the entire project.
     B, C, and D are incorrect because these are incorrect statements about the activities
     on the critical path.

7.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the analogous estimating technique estimates the
     duration of an activity based on the duration of a similar activity in a previous project.
     A is incorrect because parametric estimating uses parameters such as the productivity
     rate of the resource assigned to the activity.
     B is incorrect because the individual in this example used the analogous method and
     not the expert judgment method, even though he happened to be an expert--we don't
     know in which field.
     D is incorrect because the Delphi technique is used for risk identification, not for
     activity duration estimating, and also there are multiple experts involved in the Delphi
     technique.

8.   Answer: C
     C is correct because the team member is offering a valid reason for the change, and it
     does not affect the finish date of the project. However, you must change the schedule
     to reflect the new duration estimate.
     A is incorrect because you do not need to consult with the functional manager in
     making this decision because the team member is offering a valid reason for the
     change, and it does not affect the finish date of the project.
     B is incorrect because if you accept the change, you must modify the schedule
     accordingly.
     D is incorrect because this change does not qualify to be processed through the inte-
     grated change control process.

9.   Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because float time is the positive difference between the
     allowed late start date and the early start date of a schedule activity, without changing
     the schedule finish date.
     B, C, and D are incorrect because these are not valid terms used to describe delaying
     an activity without changing the schedule finish date.
442   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         10.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because by doing some activities in parallel (fast tracking), you
                might be able to compress the schedule without adding cost.
                A is incorrect because crashing usually results in increased cost because it involves
                adding extra resources.
                C is incorrect because the project sponsor is sponsoring (paying for) the project. So,
                asking for a new sponsor does not make sense; it can only trigger the sponsor to ask
                for a new project manager.
                D is incorrect because you do not want to bypass the sponsor on budgetary matters
                because the budget will need the sponsor's approval.

         11.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because it has the longest sequence: 8+6+8=22.
                A is incorrect because this path is only 20 units long.
                B is incorrect because there is no such path as Start-I-G-E-Finish in this network
                diagram.
                D is incorrect because this path is only 21 units long, which is less than 22.
                E is incorrect because there is no such path as Start-I-G-H-E-Finish in this network
                diagram.

         12.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the float time for G is zero because it is on the critical
                path.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because G is on the critical path and must have a float time
                of zero.

         13.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because if you consider all the paths in the network diagram,
                the path Start-F-G-H-Finish adds up to 22, which is longer than any other path in
                the diagram.
                A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they do not add up to the correct total for the
                path.

         14.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because in the three-point method with the PERL technique,
                the duration estimate is the weighted average: (9+18+4x12)/6=12.5.
                A is incorrect because in the PERL technique, a weight of 4 is assigned to the most
                likely scenario as compared to the weight of 1 for each of the optimistic and pes-
                simistic scenarios.
                C and D are incorrect because the duration estimate should be the weighted average
                of the three points.

   15.   Answer: B
         B is the correct answer because the activity duration is calculated after an activity has
         been defined.
         A, C, and D are incorrect because the WBS, project scope statement, and WBS dic-
         tionary (as parts of the scope baseline) are valid input items to the Define Activities
         process.

   16.   Answer: A
         A is the correct answer because by trying to understand the phrases and terms, you are
         trying to decode the message, and those phrases and terms are acting as noise.
         B and C are incorrect because this is a message sent by the team member and is not a
         response.
         D is incorrect because we don't know in which language the message is written.

   17.   Answer: D
         D is the correct answer because stakeholder management is an input to communica-
         tion planning.
         A, B, and C are incorrect because all these items are part of the communication man-
         agement plan, an output of communication planning.



Chapter 5
    1.   Answer: D
         D is the correct answer because a chart that displays the resource requirements for
         each activity is an example of a resource assignment matrix (RAM).
         A is incorrect because a project organization chart represents the relationships
         between the different roles in the project, and that is not what management wants.
         B is incorrect because the WBS contains the work packages, not the activities and the
         resource requirements.
         C is incorrect because management wants the resource requirements for each activity,
         not just a list of roles and responsibilities.

    2.   Answer: C
         C is the correct answer because the project schedule is the output of the Develop
         Schedule process.
         A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are the output of the human resource
         planning process.
444   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          3.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the project manager (along with the project manage-
                ment team) is responsible for the staff management plan, and it is created as an out-
                put of the human resource planning efforts in a process called Develop Human
                Resource Plan.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the staff manage-
                ment plan.

          4.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the cost baseline is an output of the Determine Bud-
                get process.
                B and D are incorrect because there are no standard processes with these names.
                C is incorrect because the Estimate Costs process is used to estimate the costs, and
                these estimates needs to be aggregated to determine the budget.

          5.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the human resource plan is an input into estimating
                costs.
                A and C are incorrect because you cannot estimate costs until you have a human
                resource plan, and you cannot determine budget until you have cost estimates.
                D is incorrect because there is no standard process with this name.

          6.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer, and the other answers are incorrect because the project
                schedule is an input to estimating costs, cost estimates are an input to determining the
                budget, and the project schedule and budget (cost baseline) are an input to planning
                procurements.

          7.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because contingency reserve is applied both to activity dura-
                tions (time) and cost estimates.
                B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements about contin-
                gency reserve.

          8.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the cost overrun is borne by the seller.
                A is incorrect because in cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) cost overrun is paid by the
                buyer.
                B is incorrect because in time and materials (T&M), the increased cost due to the
                increased quantity of resources, such as work hours by a contractor, is borne by the buyer.
                C is incorrect because in cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC), cost overrun is paid by
                the buyer.
         ANSWERS FOR CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS                                     Appendix B          445


    9.   Answer: A
         A is the correct answer because it's only the rates for labor and material that are fixed.
         B, C, and D are incorrect because the given scenario does not match the definitions
         of these contract types.

   10.   Answer: B
         B is the correct answer because contract types are a tool and not an input to planning
         procurements.
         A, C, and D are incorrect answers because all of these are true statements.

   11.   Answer: C
         C is the correct answer because cost overrun is paid by the buyer, and the fee increases
         with the increase in cost as well.
         A is incorrect because the firm fixed price presents risk to both buyer and seller
         because the fixed price might turn out to be above or below the actual cost.
         B and D are incorrect because the fee in these cases does not rise with the increase of
         the actual cost.

   12.   Answer: A
         A is the correct answer because you can fairly estimate the cost for one program, and
         you do not know the number of programs required.
         B and C are incorrect because the reimbursable cost does not make sense in this case,
         and you don't have to add a fee to the cost.
         D is incorrect because you cannot correctly estimate the total price because you do not
         know how many programs are required.



Chapter 6
    1.   Answer: B
         B is the correct answer because a risk can have a negative or a positive effect on a
         project.
         A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements about project
         risks.

    2.   Answer: A
         A is correct because the risk register is the output of the risk identification process,
         but it is not used as an input because it does not exist before this process.
         B, C, and D are incorrect because the risk register is an input item to qualitative risk
         analysis, quantitative risk analysis, and risk response planning, whereas the updated
         risk register is an output from each of these processes.
446   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          3.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because you cannot identify risks in your specific project based
                on the information collected from the Web.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because brainstorming, Delphi technique, and
                SWOT analysis are valid information-gathering techniques used for identifying risks.

          4.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because depending upon the experience of the team, a risk can
                be moved directly after the identification process to the quantitative analysis process
                without performing the qualitative analysis.
                B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements.

          5.    Answer: B
                B is correct because building redundancy into a system is an example of mitigating the
                risk.
                A is incorrect because the risk can still happen because you have not changed the
                plan, such as moving the server center to some other city.
                C is incorrect because accepting a risk means no action or a conditional action.
                D is incorrect because you have not transferred the risk to a third party.

          6.    Answer: D
                D is correct because the risk has been transferred to a third party.
                A is incorrect because the risk can still happen because you have not changed the
                plan, such as eliminating the need for that part of the system.
                B is incorrect because mitigating the risk does not involve transferring the risk to a
                third party.
                C is incorrect because accepting a risk means no action or a conditional action.

          7.    Answer: C
                C is correct because the numerical analysis of a risk is called quantitative risk analysis.
                A is incorrect because assigning numbers does not necessarily mean you are perform-
                ing a Monte Carlo simulation, although it is one of the tools to perform quantitative
                analysis.
                B is incorrect because qualitative analysis does not involve numerical analysis, such as
                EMV calculations.
                D is incorrect because risk response planning will be based on the results of risk
                analysis.

 8.   Answer: D
      D is correct because the probability of the risk is 50%, and the probability of the posi-
      tive impact is 40%, so the total probability for the positive impact to happen is
      0.5x0.4=0.2.
      EMV=ProbabilityxValue of the outcome=0.2x$200,000=$40,000
      A, B, and C are incorrect because they show wrong values for EMV.

 9.   Answer: A
      A is correct because the probability of the risk is 50%, and the probability of the posi-
      tive impact is 40%, so the total probability for the positive impact to happen is
      0.5x0.4=0.2.
      EMV=ProbabilityxValue of the outcome=0.2x$200,000=$40,000
      Similarly, EMV for threat=0.3x$50,000=-$15,000
      Therefore, EMV for the risk=$40,000-$15,000=$25,000
      B, C, and D are incorrect because they show wrong values for EMV.

10.   Answer: D
      D is correct because secondary risks are those risks that arise as a result of risk
      responses.
      A is incorrect because a residual risk is a risk that remains after a response has been
      performed.
      B is incorrect because depending upon the nature of the secondary risk, it may have
      any priority.
      C is incorrect because the risk response will depend upon the analysis results of the
      risk.

11.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because there is no such risk response named risk rejection.
      A, B, and C are all incorrect answers because these are valid risk responses.

12.   Answer: A
      A is correct because SWOT is a risk identification technique that identifies the risks
      by examining the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of a
      given project.
      B is incorrect because this is a wrong statement about SWOT.
      C and D are incorrect because SWOT is a technique used in risk identification, not in
      risk response planning, nor in quantitative risk analysis.
448   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         13.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because you need to perform quantitative risk analysis to cre-
                ate a list of risks prioritized based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project
                objectives.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because these are the possible output items from the quali-
                tative risk analysis.

         14.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the decision about a risk-related contractual agree-
                ment can be an output of risk response planning, not the quantitative risk analysis.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because all these are the possible output items from the
                quantitative risk analysis.

         15.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because benchmarking is a quality planning technique that
                compares practices, products, or services of a project with those of some reference pro-
                jects for the purpose of learning, improving, and creating the basis for measuring per-
                formance.
                A is incorrect because you can always brainstorm, but it does not have to compare the
                results of similar activities.
                C is incorrect because although it is a quality planning technique, it involves striking a
                balance between cost and benefit (which are not similar).
                D is incorrect because quality metrics are not quality planning techniques; these are
                output items of the quality planning process.

         16.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer.
                B is incorrect because Shewhart defined the plan-do-check-act cycle of quality man-
                agement and Deming modified it.
                C and D are incorrect because Crosby and Juan have contributions to the knowledge
                base of quality management, but they did not define the plan-do-check-act cycle.

         17.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because one of the tenets of modern quality management is
                that quality is planned, designed, and built in, and not inspected in.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because there are no such tenets in modern quality
                management.

Chapter 7
   1.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because corrective actions are recommended by the QA
        process.
        A, B, and C are incorrect answers because deliverables and work performance infor-
        mation (status) are generated, and defect repairs are implemented by the Direct and
        Manage Project Execution process.

   2.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because corrective actions are an output item of the QA
        process.
        A, B, and C are incorrect answers because quality metrics generated by quality plan-
        ning, quality control measurements generated by quality control, and work perfor-
        mance information (status) generated by the Direct and Manage Project Execution
        process all become input to the QA process.

   3.   Answer: C
        C is the correct answer because buy-or-make analysis is a technique used in the pro-
        curement planning process called Plan Procurements.
        A is incorrect because buy-or-make decisions are input to the Conduct Procurements
        process.
        B is incorrect because there is no standard process called Select Sellers.
        D is incorrect because Estimate Costs is not the process in which make-or-buy deci-
        sions are made.

   4.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because the procurement documents should be rigorous
        enough to ensure consistent responses from different sellers that can be fairly com-
        pared to one another and flexible enough to allow sellers to offer suggestions on better
        ways to satisfy the requirements.
        A is incorrect because it does not allow sellers to be creative in offering solutions.
        B is incorrect because documents must be rigid enough that each seller understands
        the requirements.
        C is incorrect because the requirements are set by the buyer and not by the seller.

   5.   Answer: C
        C is the correct answer because the amount of work and hence the cost cannot be
        determined at this point.
        A is incorrect because the amount of work and hence the cost cannot be determined
        at this point.
450   Part VI        APPENDIXES


                B is incorrect because a time and materials contract is used when the cost of an item
                can be fairly estimated but the number of needed items is unknown. This is not the
                case here.
                D is incorrect because there is no such contract type as cost plus time.

          6.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because quality planning is the process to plan for quality,
                which is the degree to which the project requirements are met.
                A is incorrect because quality control is the process to monitor specific project results
                to ensure they meet the planned quality standards.
                C is incorrect because quality assurance is the process of applying (not planning) the
                planned quality activities to ensure (and verify) that the requirements are met.
                D is incorrect because this answer is not relevant to the given scenario.

          7.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the quality audit is a technique for performing quality
                assurance.
                B and C are incorrect because the quality audit is a technique for performing quality
                assurance, whereas quality planning is about determining which quality standards are
                relevant to the project and how to satisfy them. Quality assurance is about applying
                the planned quality activities.
                D is incorrect because there is no such quality management process as quality
                inspection.

          8.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer and A, C, and D are incorrect because quality assurance uses
                the output of quality planning and quality control as its input.

          9.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because only approved change requests should be implemented.
                B is incorrect because the project manager, not the QA department, is responsible for
                dealing with change requests.
                C is incorrect because the project manager is an agent of change, a manager of
                change, and not an opponent of change by default.
                D is incorrect because any change request must go through the approval process.

         10.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because auditing (inspecting) is part of the quality assurance
                process.
                A and B are incorrect because auditing is a tool used in quality assurance.

        D is the correct answer because collaboration offers a win/win resolution.
        A is incorrect because avoidance ignores the problem rather than solving it.
        B is incorrect because in compromising, both parties give up something and might
        look at the resolution as a lose/lose proposition.
        C is incorrect because accommodation offers a win/lose resolution; one party gives up
        something to accommodate the interests of the other party.

   2.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because you are forcing your way on the other party.
        A and B are incorrect because you are neither ignoring the problem nor compromising.
        C is incorrect because you are not accommodating the other side.

   3.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because change in budget has very little to do directly with
        team development.
        A and B are incorrect answers because the project kickoff meeting is an indirect
        method to start team development, and an effective resolution of a conflict does con-
        tribute to team building.

        A is incorrect because the human resource plan contains roles and responsibilities and
        not all the staff assignments.
        B is incorrect because staff assignments are an input to the Develop Project Team

                the team.

          8.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because Theory X managers think that employees dislike their
                work and will try to avoid it.
                A is incorrect because there is no standard management theory called Theory Alpha.
                C is incorrect because Theory Y managers trust their employees.
                D is incorrect because McClellands's theory states that the need for achievement,
                affiliation, and power motivates employees.

          9.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because Theory Y managers trust their employees.
                A is incorrect because there is no standard management theory called Theory Alpha.

                will try to avoid it.
                D is incorrect because McClellands's theory states that the need for achievement,
                affiliation, and power motivates employees. C is the more appropriate answer in this
                case.

         10.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because McClelland's theory states that the need for achieve-
                ment, affiliation, and power motivates employees.
                A is incorrect because there is no standard management theory called Theory Alpha.

Chapter 9
   1.   Answer: A
        A is the correct answer because performance reports are an input to the Distribute
        Information process.
        B, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are part of the output of the
        Distribute Information process.

   2.   Answer: B
        B is the correct answer because issue logs are used to track and manage stakeholder
        issues in the process of managing stakeholder expectations.
        A and C are incorrect answers because these processes do not use the issue log as
        input.
        D is incorrect because there is no standard process named Resolve Issues.

   3.   Answer: B
        B is the correct answer because the change log is used to document changes that occur
        during the project, and it works as an input to managing stakeholder expectations.
        A and C are incorrect answers because these processes do not use the change log as an
        input.
        D is incorrect because the Perform Integrated Change Control process is the high-
        level process that is used to review change requests and approve or reject them.

   4.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because both the Distribute Information and Manage
        Stakeholder Expectations processes belong to communication management.
        A is incorrect because you are not really managing the stakeholders as resources;
        you are managing their expectations.
        B is incorrect because stakeholders belonging to the procurement part are only a
        subset of all stakeholders.
        C is incorrect because there is no standard knowledge area called stakeholder
        management.

   5.   Answer: C
        C is the correct answer because it is the responsibility of the project manager to man-
        age stakeholder expectations.
        A, B, and D are incorrect answers because the project manager can ask for help from
        anyone in managing the stakeholder expectations, but the responsibility of managing
        stakeholder expectations falls upon none other than the project manager.
454   Part VI       APPENDIXES


          6.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because you use the Distribute Information process to distrib-
                ute information, such as performance reports, among the stakeholders.
                A is incorrect because the Report Performance process is used to create performance
                reports.
                B is incorrect because there is no standard process called Distribute Reports.
                D is incorrect because Manage Stakeholder Expectations is a more general process; it
                is not the process used specifically to distribute information.

          7.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the executing process group contains two communica-
                tion processes: Distribute Information and Manage Stakeholder Expectations.
                A is incorrect because there is no standard process called Distribute Reports.
                C is incorrect because Report Performance belongs to the monitoring and controlling
                process group.

   Chapter 10
          1.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because changes can happen and need to be managed
                throughout the lifecycle of a project.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because changes can happen and need to be managed
                throughout the lifecycle of a project.

          2.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the recommendations for corrective and preventive
                actions and change requests must be processed through the integrated change control
                process for approval.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because changes and recommendations are approved
                through the integrated change control process.

          3.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because all change requests are processed through the inte-
                grated change control process.
                A is incorrect because project management is performed through processes.
                B is incorrect because the Direct and Manage Project Execution process can generate
                change requests, but this process is not used to evaluate change requests.

4.   Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because project work is monitored largely by comparing pro-
     ject performance to planned performance.
     B and C are incorrect because the Perform Integrated Change Control process uses
     work performance information (the raw data for the performance reports) and not the
     performance reports as input.
     D is incorrect because there is no standard process with this name.

5.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the name of the standard process to monitor and con-
     trol procurements is called Administer Procurements according to the latest (Fourth
     Edition) PMI Standard.
     A and D are incorrect because there are no standard processes with these names.
     C is incorrect because Contract Administration was the name of the process in the
     Third Edition of the Standard, not in the current edition.

6.   Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because the Administer Procurements process uses perfor-
     mance reports generated by the Report Performance process and approval of change
     requests generated by the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
     A is incorrect because the Administer Procurements process will need approved
     change requests from the Perform Integrated Change Control process, which there-
     fore must be run first.
     B and C are incorrect because Report Performance must be run before Administer
     Procurements, as it uses performance reports generated by the Report Performance
     process.

7.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because work performance information is the output of the
     Direct and Manage Project Execution process.
     A is incorrect because Report Performance uses work performance measurements to
     create performance reports.
     B is incorrect because the Distribute Information process is used to distribute the
     information.
     D is incorrect because the Control Scope, Control Schedule, and Control Cost
     processes are used to convert work performance information into work performance
     measurements.
456   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          8.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the Control Scope, Control Schedule, and Control
                Cost processes are used to convert work performance information into work perfor-
                mance measurements.
                A is incorrect because Report Performance uses work performance measurements to
                create performance reports.
                B is incorrect because the Distribute Information process is used to distribute the
                information.
                C is incorrect because it is work performance information and not performance mea-
                surements that are the output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.



   Chapter 11
          1.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the Ishikawa diagram is a tool used in the Perform
                Quality Control process to explore all the potential causes of a problem. Also, Perform
                Quality Assurance processes use all the tools and techniques of the Perform Quality
                Control processes.
                A is incorrect because there is no standard process called Assure Quality.
                B is incorrect because an Ishikawa diagram is a tool used during the Perform Quality
                Control process and not during the Plan Quality process.
                D is incorrect because auditing and inspection are tools and not processes.

          2.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because a control chart is used to plot the results to determine
                whether they are within the acceptable limits.
                B is incorrect because a cause and effect diagram, also called an Ishikawa diagram or a
                fishbone diagram, is used to explore all the possible causes of a problem.
                C is incorrect because a Pareto diagram is used to identify and rank errors based on
                the frequency of defects caused by them.
                D is incorrect because a scatter diagram is used to find the relationship between two
                variables, such as cause and effect, or two causes.

          3.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because a Pareto diagram can be used to rank problems based
                on the frequency of defects caused by them. Then, you will direct the team effort to
                fix those problems that caused most of the defects.
                A is incorrect because a control chart is used to plot the results to determine whether
                they are within the acceptable limits.

     B is incorrect because a cause and effect diagram, also called an Ishikawa diagram or a
     fishbone diagram, is used to explore all the possible causes of a problem.
     D is incorrect because a scatter diagram is used to find the relationship between two
     variables, such as cause and effect, or two causes.

4.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because by using statistical sampling, you will pick up a few
     samples of the code at random and get them reviewed. The results will represent the
     quality of the whole code, statistically speaking.
     A is incorrect because this is not an unreasonable demand.
     C is incorrect because testing tools cannot serve the purpose of a code review, and the
     customer wants the code review.
     D is incorrect because you have limited resources.

5.   Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because the risk-related recommendations for corrective
     actions are the output of the risk monitoring and controlling process.
     A, B, and C are incorrect because the outputs of these processes do not include rec-
     ommended corrective actions.

6.   Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because the recommendations for corrective and preventive
     actions and change requests must be processed through the integrated change control
     process for approval.
     B, C, and D are incorrect because changes and recommendations are approved
     through the integrated change control process.

7.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because quality control measurements are an output of quality
     controlling.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are included in the input to quality
     control.

8.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because an approved change request is an input to the Perform
     Quality Control process. You need to monitor this list to ensure that all the changes
     on this list are implemented.
     A is incorrect because Perform Integrated Change Control can have approved change
     requests as output, not as input.
     C and D are incorrect because these processes do not use approved change requests as
     input.
458   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          9.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because technical performance measurements are a technique
                used in the Monitor and Control Risks process but not in the Perform Quality Con-
                trol process.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because all of these are tools and techniques for the Perform
                Quality Control process.

         10.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because measuring technical performance is a technique--and
                not an input--used in monitoring and controlling risks.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because these items are included in the input of monitoring

   Chapter 12
          1.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the right action here is to find the source of the
                change requests and process the request through the integrated change control
                process.
                A is incorrect because you are taking action without doing your homework:
                investigation.
                B is incorrect because you should not let anyone apply the changes without the
                changes having been approved.
                D is incorrect because the right course of action here is to find out the source of the
                change request and ensure that the request goes through the approval process.

          2.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because a budget review is not an output item from the sched-
                ule control process.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because all these items are the output of the schedule con-
                trol process formally called Control Schedule.

          3.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the formula for earned value is:
                EV=BACx(work completed/total work required)
                which means
                EV=$600,000x(5 miles/15 miles)=$200,000
                A is incorrect because $160,000 is the actual cost (AC) and not the earned value (EV).
     ANSWERS FOR CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS                                   Appendix B        459


     C is incorrect because earned value is proportional to the fraction of work performed
     and not the fraction of time passed.
     D is incorrect because $600,000 is the budget at completion (BAC), not the EV.

4.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the formula for planned value is:
     PV=BACx(time passed/total schedule time)
     which means
     PV=$600,000x(3 weeks/12 weeks)=$150,000
     A is incorrect because $160,000 is the actual cost (AC) and not the planned value (EV).
     B is incorrect because planned value is proportional to the fraction of time passed, not
     the fraction of work performed.
     D is incorrect because $600,000 is the budget at completion (BAC), not the PV.

5.   Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because the formula for cost variance is:
     CV=EV-AC
     which means
     CV=$200,000-$160,000=$40,000
     B is incorrect because CV is equal to EV-AC, not EV-PV.
     C is incorrect because it calculates the total cost for 12 weeks based on AC for three
     weeks and then subtracts it from BAC, which is the wrong method to calculate CV.
     D is incorrect because it calculates the total cost for 15 miles based on AC for five
     miles and then subtracts it from BAC, which is the wrong method to calculate CV.

6.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the formula for schedule variance is:
     SV=EV-PV
     which means
     SV=$200,000-$150,000=$50,000
     A is incorrect because SV is equal to EV-PV, not EV-AC.
     C and D are incorrect because SV is measured in units of cost, not in units of time.

7.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because a CPI value greater than one means the cost perfor-
     mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than one
     means the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because a CPI value greater than one means the cost per-
     formance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than one
     means the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.
460   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          8.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the three elements of the triple constraint are scope,
                time, and cost.
                B and C are incorrect because quality is not considered one of the three elements of
                the triple constraint, even though it may be affected by the triple constraint.
                D is incorrect because scope is missing from the list.

          9.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because cost and scope are the two elements of the triple con-
                straint in addition to time. If one of these three elements changes, one or both of the
                other two will change.
                A and B are incorrect because none of deliverables, quality, and risk is included in the
                triple constraint.
                D is incorrect because cost and budget make one element in the triple constraint.

         10.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because controlling scope, schedule, and costs generates work
                performance measurements.
                A is incorrect because the Report Performance process is used to generate the perfor-
                mance reports and uses work performance measurements as input.
                C is incorrect because the Perform Quality Control process uses work performance
                measurements as an input and does not generate them.
                D is incorrect because the Monitor and Control Project Work process does not gener-
                ate work performance measurements.



   Chapter 13
          1.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because if the project is behind the planned schedule, it does
                not mean it should be closed. You can bring it back on schedule, or you can change
                the plan accordingly.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because all these scenarios will cause the project to close,
                and when a project is closed, it must be closed by using the processes in the closing
                process group.

          2.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because future projects can benefit the most from the review if
                all the stages of the project are covered with both positive and negative aspects.
     ANSWERS FOR CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS                                   Appendix B        461


     B and D are incorrect because all the stages and aspects of the project should be
     reviewed.
     C is incorrect because both positive and negative aspects should be covered with equal
     emphasis.

3.   Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because if the project is to be successful, it must have been
     executed and controlled successfully before the closure begins.
     A, B, and C are incorrect because if a project has not made it to the closing stage by
     the time closing begins, the project is being terminated without completion.

4.   Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because no project, small or large, should skip the closing
     stage.
     A, B, and C are incorrect because no project should skip the closing stage. Each pro-
     ject must go through a proper closure.

5.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because it is the project sponsor who signs the final closure
     documents and can send the project to closure at any stage of the project.
     A is incorrect because the project manager is responsible for managing all the activi-
     ties needed to close the project, but the closure must be authorized by the sponsor.
     B and D are incorrect because neither the customer nor the functional manager can
     authorize the project closure.

6.   Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the deliverables accepted through procurement closure
     must go through project closure for handing them over to the customer or the sponsor.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because all these activities are part of the procurement
     closure.

7.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the deliverables accepted through the quality control
     process must go through the Verify Scope process before they can become an input to
     the Close Project process.
     A and D are incorrect because these items are included in the organizational process
     assets used to close the project.
     B is incorrect because the project management plan is a valid input to the Close Pro-
     ject process.
462   Part VI        APPENDIXES


          8.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the closed contracts are the output of the Close Pro-
                curements process.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are the output of the Close Project
                process.

          9.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the deliverables must go through the Verify Scope
                process before going through the Close Project process, and before the scope can be
                verified, they must be validated through the quality control process.
                A is incorrect because the deliverables must be validated through the quality control
                process before their scope can be verified.

          1.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by the
                PMI states that if you can substantiate it with facts, it is your responsibility to report
                possible violations of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by individuals in
                the field of project management.
                A and B are incorrect because you can do it if you feel like it, but this is not the best
                answer.
                C is incorrect because you don't know whether a law was violated, and according to
                the Code of Conduct statement, D is the best answer.

          2.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because if in a foreign land you are being asked to do some-
                thing that is unethical and illegal in your home country, you are supposed to investi-
                gate whether it is illegal and unethical there as well.
                B and D are incorrect because you don't know yet whether the sponsor is asking you
                to do something illegal.
                C is incorrect because you think it is unethical and illegal, so you must investigate it.

     such by others, rather than as mere networking.

6.   Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because this is not part of the Code of Ethics and Professional
     Conduct by PMI.

     estimate based on the same information about the work that the other vendors are.

464   Part VI        APPENDIXES

                the stakeholders informed of the project status.

                project status to the stakeholders.
                C is incorrect because you don't have enough information to take this action.

                a solution.

         10.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because it is not your job to investigate the legality of the
                company procedures.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are parts of the professional responsibility
                of a project manager.

         11.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because fairness, honesty, respect, and responsibility are the
                four fundamental values in the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by the PMI.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because one fundamental value is missing from each of
                these options.

Answers and Explanations
   1.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because cost variance is not a project selection method. In fact,
        you will not be able to determine the cost variance until the project starts executing.
        A, B, and C are incorrect because these are valid project selection methods.

   2.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because operations managers and functional managers usually
        have a role to play in the project. The CEO and project managers are obvious stake-
        holders.
        A, B, and C are incorrect because D is a more complete answer.

   3.   Answer: C
        C is the correct answer because the project charter, which is an output of a process of
        the initiating process group, must be approved before the project can start.
        A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not the outputs of the processes in the ini-
        tiating process group.

   4.   Answer: A
        A is the correct answer because the project charter approval officially starts the project.
        B is incorrect because the project scope statement determines the scope of the project,
        whereas the project charter must be approved before you start the project.
        C is incorrect because there is no such document as the project initiation plan docu-
        ment.
        D is incorrect because the project management plan is produced in the planning stage
        of the project, and the project does not move to the planning stage until the project
        charter is approved.

   5.   Answer: D
        D is the correct answer because the Perform Quality Control process is used to rec-
        ommend corrective or preventive actions to meet quality standards.
        A is incorrect because testing is not a project management process.
        B is incorrect because quality planning is used to identify the quality standards rele-
        vant to the project and to determine how to satisfy them.
        C is incorrect because the risk response planning process is used during the planning
        stage for the identified risks, not during the control stage.

          6.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the two defining characteristics of a project are that it
                has a beginning and an end and that it creates a unique product, service, or result.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because they exclude two defining characteristics of a pro-
                ject: It has a beginning and an end, and it creates a unique product, service, or result.

          7.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because a program is a set of related projects that are managed
                in a coordinated way to obtain optimal results.
                A is incorrect because a large budget does not make a project a program.
                B is incorrect because a set of processes is called a process group.
                C is incorrect because the projects in a program are usually related to each other by
                the very nature of the program.

          8.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the Plan Procurements process is used to plan the pro-
                curements.
                A and C are incorrect because neither of these is a correct name for any of the project
                management processes.
                D is incorrect because Close Procurements belongs to the closing part of the project.

          9.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the Conduct Procurements process is used to solicit
                seller responses, select sellers, and award a contract.
                A is incorrect because the tasks already mentioned in the statement of the question are
                performed using the Plan Procurements process.
                C is incorrect because the Administer Procurements process is performed after you
                already have awarded contracts.
                D is incorrect because there is no standard process called Request Seller Responses.

         10.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the project manager has the highest level of authority
                in a projectized organization.
                A is incorrect because the project manager has the lowest level of authority in a func-
                tional organization.
                B is incorrect because the project manager's authority in a strong matrix organization
                is not higher than that in a projectized organization.
                C is incorrect because the project manager's authority in a weak matrix organization is
                lower than that in a projectized organization.
                                                     FINAL EXAM              Appendix C           505


11.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the project manager has the lowest level of authority
      in a functional organization.
      B is incorrect because the project manager's authority in a strong matrix organization
      is higher than that in a functional organization.
      C is incorrect because the project manager's authority in a weak matrix organization is
      higher than that in a functional organization.
      D is incorrect because the project manager has the highest level of authority in a pro-
      jectized organization.

12.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because performance evaluations belong to the monitoring and
      controlling process group.
      A and B are incorrect because performance evaluations belong to the monitoring and
      controlling process group.
      D is incorrect because there is no project management process group named evaluating.

13.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the
      project stakeholders' expectations.
      A is incorrect because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the project
      stakeholders' expectations.
      B and C are incorrect because the differences about objectives (and conflicts among
      the team members) must be resolved. Different expectations for the project mean that
      the stakeholders are not on the same page about the project scope, and that can be
      damaging to the project.

14.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because the five process groups are initiating, planning, execut-
      ing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Note that monitoring and controlling is
      the name of one process group; it is also informally called monitoring or controlling.
      A is incorrect because monitoring and controlling is one process group.
      C and D are incorrect because scoping and testing are not valid names for the project
      management process groups.

15.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the project charter must make the business' case to
      justify the project.
      B is incorrect because the SOW is an input to the Develop Project Charter process; it
      will be used to develop the charter.
506   Part VI        APPENDIXES


                C is incorrect because the project scope statement is not part of the project charter.
                D is incorrect because the project management plan will be developed in the planning
                stage after the charter has been issued.

         16.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because process groups usually involve overlapping activities.
                For example, you monitor and control the project at the same time as you are execut-
                ing it.
                A and D are incorrect because process groups are seldom either discrete or one-time
                events.
                C is incorrect because the level of involvement for a given process group might be dif-
                ferent for different phases of a project; it depends upon the needs.

         17.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because reviewing the initiating processes at the beginning of
                each phase helps keep the project focused on the business need for which the project
                was started.
                A is incorrect because it's the wrong reason for reviewing the initiating processes.
                B is incorrect because one of the purposes of reviewing the initiating processes is to
                determine whether the project should continue. If the business needs have changed,
                either the project should be cancelled or its scope should be changed.
                D is incorrect because reviewing the initiating process is not a waste of time; it is a
                very important task.

         18.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because in functional organizations, the functional managers
                are the bosses who assign the work to employees.
                B is incorrect because employees do not report to the project managers in a functional
                organization.
                C and D are incorrect because the project teams and project management teams do
                not make the work assignment decisions.

         19.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the initiating group is used to authorize a project or a
                phase of a project.
                B is incorrect because there is no project management process group named phase ini-
                tiating.
                C and D are incorrect because the planning and executing process groups are not used
                to authorize a project.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix C          507


20.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because there is no process group called designing and testing.
      A and C are incorrect because each of these names two process groups.
      D is incorrect because monitoring and controlling is a process group.

21.   Answer: B and E
      B and E are the correct answers because there are no knowledge areas recognized by
      PMI with the names team management and stakeholder management.
      A, C, D, F, and G are incorrect because these are valid names for project management
      knowledge areas.

22.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because a Pareto diagram is used to prioritize defects by dis-
      playing the frequencies of their occurrences. It is a tool used in the Perform Quality
      Control process.
      A is incorrect because a control chart is used to determine whether an output variable
      is within the control limits. It is a tool used in the Perform Quality Control process.
      C is incorrect because decision tree analysis is a technique used in quantitative risk
      analysis to choose between alternative capital strategies, such as to build or to
      upgrade.
      D is incorrect because variance analysis is a technique used to measure project perfor-
      mance by comparing the actual performance to the planned performance. The perfor-
      mance metrics are generally the schedule, scope, and cost. So, variance analysis can be
      used in cost control, scope control, and schedule control.

23.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the quality planning process is part of the planning
      process group.
      B and C are incorrect because identifying the quality standards and determining how
      to satisfy them is part of planning, not executing or controlling.
      D is incorrect because there is no process group named the quality planning process
      group.

24.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because there is no process named estimate time.
      A, B, and C are incorrect because all these processes belong to time management.

25.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because variance analysis is a technique used to measure pro-
      ject performance by comparing the actual performance to the planned performance in
      terms of scope, cost, and schedule. So, variance analysis can be used in cost control,
      scope control, and schedule control.
508   Part VI        APPENDIXES


                A is incorrect because a control chart is used to determine whether an output variable
                is within the control limits. It is a tool used in the Perform Quality Control process.
                B is incorrect because a Pareto diagram is used to prioritize defects by displaying the
                frequencies of their occurrences. It is a tool used in the Perform Quality Control
                process.
                C is incorrect because decision tree analysis is a technique used in the quantitative risk
                analysis to choose between alternative capital strategies, such as to build or to
                upgrade.

         26.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the purpose of the schedule control process is to man-
                age (monitor and control) the schedule changes and make sure the changes go
                through an approval system before implementation.
                A is incorrect because schedule control does not mean no change.
                C is incorrect because scope creep is an issue that belongs to scope control.
                D is incorrect because the schedule control process is to control all schedule-related
                changes, not just those related to the activities on the critical path.

         27.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the scope is determined by the project scope state-
                ment, not by the project charter.
                B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are the correct statements about pro-
                ject charter.

         28.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the scope statement is an output of the process called
                Define Scope.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are all valid items to be included in
                the project scope statement.

         29.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the project scope statement, also called the detailed
                project scope statement, is the major output of the scope definition process.
                A and C are incorrect because the project charter and requirement documents are
                input items to the Define Scope process.
                D is incorrect because you need to perform many other processes after the project
                definition process before you can develop the project schedule.
                                                      FINAL EXAM               Appendix C           509


30.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because decision tree analysis is a technique used in quantita-
      tive risk analysis to choose between alternative capital strategies, such as to build or to
      upgrade.
      A is incorrect because a control chart is used to determine whether an output variable
      is within the control limits. It is a tool used in the Perform Quality Control process.
      B is incorrect because a Pareto diagram is used to prioritize defects by displaying the
      frequencies of their occurrences. It is a tool used in the Perform Quality Control
      process.
      D is incorrect because variance analysis is a technique used to measure the project
      performance by comparing the actual performance to the planned performance in
      terms of scope, cost, and schedule. So, variance analysis can be used in cost control,
      scope control, and schedule control.

31.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because a constraint is a state of being restricted to a given
      course of action (or inaction). It limits the team's options. Hard deadlines and prede-
      fined budgets are examples of constraints.
      B and C are incorrect because quality standards and activities on the critical path are
      not constraints.
      D is incorrect because the possibility of a strike is a risk, not a constraint.

32.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because there is no standard process called Plan Scope. The
      scope is developed as part of the effort of developing the project management plan.
      A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these are true statements about the pro-
      ject scope management plan.

33.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because the requirements management plan is part of the out-
      put of the Collect Requirements process.
      A is incorrect because the project scope management plan is developed as part of the
      effort of developing the project management plan.
      C is incorrect because the project statement of work is an input to developing the pro-
      ject charter, which is an input to the Collect Requirements process.
      D is incorrect because the WBS is created by using the process called Create WBS.
510   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         34.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the project scope statement is an output of the Define
                Scope process.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because all these are input items to the scope definition
                process. Scope statement templates are part of the organizational process assets, an
                input to the Define Scope process.

         35.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the project scope statement does not contain the scope
                management plan, which is created even before the scope is defined.
                A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these items are included in the project
                scope statement.

         36.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because when you, the project manager, anticipate or see a
                potential problem, you should deal with it head on.
                A is incorrect because this option ignores the problem. You should not sit and let the
                problem happen before you act.
                B and C are incorrect answers because these options do not deal with the problem
                directly.

         37.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the SOW is written by the buyer to describe the prod-
                uct to be procured.
                A is incorrect because the SOW is not a contract.
                C is incorrect because the SOW is only written for the activities or the products to be
                procured.
                D is incorrect because the SOW is written by the buyer to describe the product to be
                procured.

         38.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because expert judgment is part of the tools used in defining
                the scope.
                B and C are incorrect because these are the tools used in collecting requirements.
                D is incorrect because the project charter is an input to the Define Scope process, not
                a tool.

         39.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because decomposition is a tool used in creating the WBS.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because expert judgment, product analysis, and
                facilitated workshops are all tools for the project definition process.
                                                     FINAL EXAM              Appendix C           511


40.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-
      oriented hierarchical decomposition of the project work to be performed by the pro-
      ject team.
      B is incorrect because the hierarchy of resources is called the resource breakdown struc-
      ture (RBS).
      C is incorrect because the hierarchy of risks is called the risk breakdown structure
      (RBS).
      D is incorrect because the organizational structure is called the organizational break-
      down structure (OBS).

41.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the WBS is a direct input to the Define Activities
      process; the WBS is a component of the scope baseline.
      B and D are incorrect because the WBS is not a direct input to these processes.
      C is incorrect because the scope definition process is used to develop the project scope
      statement, which is an input to the Create WBS process.

42.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the WBS is created by decomposing the project deliv-
      erables into smaller components.
      A and B are incorrect because a Pareto chart is used in quality management processes,
      such as the Perform Quality Control process, and analogous estimating is an estimat-
      ing technique used in appropriate processes, such as cost estimating.
      D is incorrect because bottom-up estimating is an estimating technique used in
      appropriate processes, such as activity resource estimating.

43.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the purpose of the variance analysis is to measure the
      deviation of the actual project performance from the planned baseline and determine
      the cause of this variance.
      B, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the variance analysis.

44.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because updates to cost estimates are an output of cost
      controlling.
      A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are all valid output items for the
      scope control process. Cost estimates can change as a result of scope change, but the
      cost estimate change must go through the Control Cost process before the documents
      are updated.
512   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         45.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the Create WBS process is part of the planning
                process group.
                A and C are incorrect because the WBS is created by using the Create WBS process,
                which is part of the planning process group.
                D is incorrect because there is no process group named scoping.

         46.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the critical path results from sequencing of activities
                and their durations.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these affect the activity duration.

         47.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because crashing is the schedule compression technique that
                involves analyzing a number of alternatives and choosing the one that lets you get the
                maximum schedule compression for the minimum cost increase.
                A is incorrect because fast tracking is the schedule compression technique that
                involves obtaining schedule compression by executing activities (or phases) in parallel
                that would normally be executed in sequence.
                B is incorrect because PDM (precedence diagramming method) is a technique to
                develop the network diagram; it's not a schedule compression technique.
                D is incorrect because there is no schedule compression technique named critical path
                elimination.

         48.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the RBS is not an input to the project definition
                process.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because the project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dic-
                tionary are all input items to the activity definition process; they are components of
                the scope baseline.

         49.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because fast tracking is the schedule compression technique
                that involves obtaining schedule compression by executing activities (or phases) in
                parallel that would normally be executed in sequence.
                B is incorrect because PDM (precedence diagramming method) is a technique to
                develop the network diagram; it's not a schedule compression technique.
                C is incorrect because crashing is the schedule compression technique that involves
                analyzing a number of alternatives and choosing the one that lets you get the maxi-
                mum schedule compression for the minimum cost increase.
                D is incorrect because there is no schedule compression technique named critical path
                elimination.

50.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because parametric estimating is a technique used in the activ-
      ity duration estimating process.
      A, C, and D are incorrect because parametric estimating is not used for these tasks (or
      processes), according to PMI.

51.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because a project schedule network diagram is an output item
      of the activity sequencing process.
      A, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these are input items to the activity
      sequencing process.

52.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the project scope management plan specifies how the
      proposed changes to the project will be managed.
      A and B are incorrect because you should check the scope management plan first.
      D is incorrect because project charter is not meant to contain the change management
      information.

53.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because network diagrams are the output of the activity
      sequencing process.
      A and B are incorrect because PDM (precedence diagramming method) and Pareto
      charts are techniques used in activity sequencing and quality control, respectively.
      C is incorrect because the WBS is an output of the Create WBS process.

54.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because once a change request is made, it is your responsibility
      to evaluate the impact of the change across the project.
      A, C, and D are incorrect because you are taking an action without investigating.

55.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the resource breakdown structure is an output of the
      resource estimating process.
      B is incorrect because the risk breakdown structure is not an output of the resource
      estimating process.
      C is incorrect because the WBS is an output of the Create WBS process.
      D is incorrect because the activity list is an input item to resource estimating.
514   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         56.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the Delphi technique is an information-gathering
                technique used to solicit expert opinions anonymously by hiding the identities of the
                experts to prevent the domination of one expert.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because the Delphi technique is basically an information-
                gathering technique.

         57.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because all these processes belong to time management.
                A is incorrect because the Monitor and Control Project Work process belongs to inte-
                gration management.
                B is incorrect because schedule compression is not a process.
                D is incorrect because the Develop Project Team process belongs to human resource
                management.

         58.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because this is the correct order of process execution; an out-
                put of the previous process is used as an input to the following process.
                B is incorrect because the WBS is an input to the activity definition process, so the
                WBS must be created before performing the activity definition process.
                C is incorrect because resource requirements are an input to the activity duration esti-
                mating process, so the activity resource estimating process must be performed before
                the activity duration estimating process.
                D is incorrect because you need the resource requirements and the activity durations
                before you can develop the schedule.


                      NOTE
                Note that I have not used the proper formal names for the processes in this and
                some other questions; you should be able to identify the process even when it's
                referred to in an informal way.
                                                      FINAL EXAM               Appendix C           515


59.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because the person or the team that will perform the work will
      have a more realistic understanding of what is involved and how long it will take.
      A is incorrect because the project manager might not know the technical details of the
      work involved. Of course, the project manager will facilitate the estimate and make
      sure it happens in a timely fashion. It's still the responsibility of the project manager
      to make it happen.
      C and D are incorrect because the project management team and senior management
      generally will not know the technical details of the work involved.

60.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because this is the wrong statement about the critical path.
      A, B, and C are incorrect because these are the defining statements for the critical path.

61.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because the work breakdown structure (WBS) dictionary con-
      tains the description of each work package in the WBS.
      A, C, and D are incorrect because these documents do not contain the work package
      descriptions.

62.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the critical chain method adds duration buffers that
      are not work schedule activities to maintain focus on the planned activity durations.
      A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not true statements about the critical
      chain method.

63.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because the three-point estimating technique determines the
      uncertainty on the activity duration, which is taken as the plain or weighted average
      of optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic values.
      A is incorrect because the final value is the average value of the optimistic, most likely,
      and pessimistic values.
      C and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the three-point esti-
      mating technique.

64.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because analogous estimating is the duration estimating tech-
      nique used to determine the duration of an activity based on the duration of a similar
      activity in a previous project.
      A, B, and C are incorrect because these are false statements about the analogous esti-
      mating technique.
516   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         65.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the earned value technique, in its various forms, is
                used to measure the performance of a project.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the earned value
                technique.

         66.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because rolling wave planning is a technique used in the
                Define Activities process. The technique is used to plan the project work at various
                levels of detail depending upon the availability of information.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the rolling wave
                planning technique.

         67.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because parametric estimating uses historical values and other
                variables to estimate activity duration and cost.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the parametric esti-
                mating technique.

         68.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the actual cost of the completed work is not required
                to calculate EV according to the following equation:
                    EV = BAC x (work completed) / (total work required)
                B, C, and D are incorrect answers because each of these items is used in calculating EV.

         69.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the cost variance is calculated as the earned value
                minus the actual cost.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because these are wrong representations of cost variance.

         70.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because CPI is calculated as the ratio of the earned value and
                the actual cost of the performed work.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because these are wrong representations of CPI.

         71.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the activity list is an input to a number of processes,
                including activity sequencing, activity resource estimating, activity duration estimat-
                ing, and schedule development.
                B is incorrect because the activity list is an output of activity definition.
                                                     FINAL EXAM               Appendix C           517


      C is incorrect because the WBS is an input to the activity definition process that gen-
      erates the activity list.
      D is incorrect because the activity list is not there yet when you are planning the scope.

72.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because
          ETC = BAC - EV = 300 - 90 = 210
      A, B, and D are incorrect because the formula for the given values does not provide
      these results.

73.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because
          ETC = BAC - EV, and
          EAC = ETC + AC = 300 - 90 + 100 = 310
      A, C, and D are incorrect because the formula for the given values does not provide
      these results.

74.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because:
          Cost performance index (CPI) = EV / AC
          From the given data, 1 / CPI = AC / EV = 0.83
          Therefore AC = EV x 0.85 = 120 x 0.83 = 99.6
      A, B, and C are incorrect because the formula for the given values does not provide
      these results.

75.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the activity list is an input to schedule development,
      but it is not an input item to schedule control.
      B, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are inputs to the schedule
      control process. Remember that the schedule baseline and schedule management plan
      are parts of the project management plan.

76.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the term "float" is synonymous with the term "slack,"
      which is the time by which you can delay an activity without affecting the early start
      date of the next activity in the sequence.
      A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not mean the same in project management
      as the term "float" does.
518   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         77.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because schedule development uses the leads and lags tech-
                nique to adjust when the successor activity should start relative to the finish date of
                the predecessor activity.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because the leads and lags technique is irrelevant to these
                processes.
         78.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the project scope statement is a major input item to
                the quality planning process called Plan Quality.
                B and C are incorrect because quality checklists and quality metrics are the output of
                the quality planning process.
                D is incorrect because cost of quality is a technique used in quality planning.
         79.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because recommended preventive actions or change requests
                are usually the output of a control process, such as the Control Quality process.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all of these are valid output items for the
                quality planning process.
         80.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because you must have a quality management plan generated
                by the quality planning process before you perform any other quality management
                process.
                A is incorrect because Define Quality is not a valid name for any process recognized
                by PMI.
                C and D are incorrect because quality control and quality assurance need to be per-
                formed according to the quality management plan generated by quality planning.
         81.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because a Pareto chart is a technique used in the quality con-
                trol process.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because these are all input items to the quality con-
                trol process.
         82.    Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because quality assurance is the process used to apply the
                planned quality activities and standards to ensure that the project employs all
                processes needed to meet the project requirements.
                A and B are incorrect because quality control is used to monitor the results to deter-
                mine whether they comply with the quality standards, and quality planning is used to
                determine which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to meet them.
                D is incorrect because there is no PMI process called Perform Testing.
                                                     FINAL EXAM              Appendix C          519


83.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because benchmarking is a technique for quality planning, not
      for quality control.
      A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these represent techniques that can be
      used in quality control.

84.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because quality metrics are the output of the quality planning
      process, and you are performing the quality assurance process.
      A, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are valid outputs of the
      quality assurance process.

85.   Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because a cause and effect diagram, also called an Ishikawa
      diagram, is a tool used in the Perform Quality Control process to explore all the
      potential causes of a problem.
      A and B are incorrect because an Ishikawa diagram is a tool used in the quality control
      process.
      D is incorrect because auditing is a technique, not a process, used in the QA process.

86.   Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because the control chart is a technique used in quality con-
      trol, not in risk management.
      A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these are characteristics of a control
      chart.

87.   Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because there is no such quality control tool as a regression
      diagram.
      B, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these represent valid tools and tech-
      niques for quality control.

88.   Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because benchmarking is a quality planning technique that
      compares practices, products, or services of a project with those of some reference pro-
      jects for the purpose of learning, improving, and creating the basis for measuring per-
      formance.
      A, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the benchmarking
      technique.
520   Part VI        APPENDIXES


         89.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because creating the WBS is necessary to understand and
                finalize the scope of the project and to determine the schedule activities.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because creating the WBS is necessary to understand and
                finalize the scope of the project and to determine the schedule activities.

         90.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because there is no PMI process called Procurement Quality
                Planning.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these are valid processes of quality
                management.

         91.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the risk register is the only output of the risk identifi-
                cation process formally called Identify Risks.
                A is incorrect because the recommended corrective actions could be the output of risk
                monitoring and controlling, but not of the risk identification process.
                C and D are incorrect because these are not output items of the risk identification
                process.

         92.    Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because there is no risk response strategy named audit.
                A, B, and C are incorrect because avoid, transfer, and mitigate are the strategies to
                respond to negative risks (threats).

         93.    Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because a good mitigation strategy is to take action early on to
                first reduce the probability of the risk happening and then plan for reducing its impact
                if it does occur, rather than letting it occur and then trying to reduce the impact or
                repair the damage.
                B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are correct statements about
                mitigation.

         94.    Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the risk register is the output of the risk identification
                process.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are input to the risk identification
                process.

 95.   Answer: A
       A is the correct answer because the processes in risk management are plan risk man-
       agement, identify risks, perform qualitative risk analysis, perform quantitative risk
       analysis, plan risk responses, and monitor and control risks.
       B is incorrect because risk evaluation is not a risk management process.
       C is incorrect because risk evaluation and risk mitigation are not risk management
       processes.
       D is incorrect because risk transference and risk assessment are not risk management
       processes.

 96.   Answer: A
       A is the correct answer because work packages, the components at the lowest levels of
       the WBS, are decomposed into activities.
       B, C, and D are incorrect because activities are derived from the work packages of the
       WBS.

 97.   Answer: D
       D is the correct answer because risk response planning is used to develop options to
       maximize opportunities and minimize threats from the risks that have already been
       identified and analyzed.
       A, B, and C are incorrect because the risks are identified and analyzed before you look
       at the options to enhance opportunities and reduce risks from them.

 98.   Answer: B
       B is the correct answer because recommended corrective actions are an output of the
       risk monitoring and controlling process but not of the risk response planning process.
       A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these items are outputs of the risk response
       planning process formally called Plan Risk Responses.

 99.   Answer: B
       B is the correct answer because an acceptance strategy is used to accept the risk--that
       is, either take no action or take action contingent upon a condition that might become
       true in the future.
       A, C, and D are incorrect because these are false interpretations of the acceptance
       strategy.

100. Answer: C
       C is correct because performance reports are input to the risk monitoring and control
       process.
       A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are output of the risk moni-
       toring and control process.
522   Part VI        APPENDIXES


        101. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because all the listed items are techniques that can be used in
                quantitative risk analysis.
                A is incorrect because mitigation is a risk response planning strategy.
                C is incorrect because checklist analysis is a technique used in the risk identification
                process.
                D is incorrect because contingency is a risk response strategy.

        102. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because risk response planning is performed in the risk
                response planning process.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because these are items that can be included in the risk
                management plan document.

        103. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the risks are prioritized in the qualitative risk analysis.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because the probability and impact matrix is a technique
                used in the qualitative risk analysis.

        104. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because risk audits are used in the risk monitoring and control
                process.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are tools and techniques for the qualitative
                risk analysis process that can be used to prioritize risks.

        105. Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the WBS dictionary is not part of the risk register.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these items are part of the risk register
                after the updates from the risk response planning process.

        106. Answer: C
                C is the correct and the best answer because the project plan is developed starting
                from the concept and going through progressive elaboration.
                A and B are incorrect because A is the lifecycle and B includes the project lifecycle.
                Progressive elaboration does not include the lifecycle of the project; its goal is to plan
                the project. Because the project planning may develop (or change) throughout the
                project lifecycle, progressive elaboration may continue through the project lifecycle,
                but it does not include the work of the lifecycle.
                D is incorrect because it is the technique to create the WBS.

107. Answer: C
     C is the correct because the project charter names the project manager and provides
     the project manager the authority to use organizational resources to run the project.
     A is incorrect because the sponsor is not authorized by the project charter; the oppo-
     site might be true.
     B is incorrect because it will be your (the project manager's) responsibility to identify
     all the stakeholders.
     D is incorrect because the project team is not formed in the initiation phase.

108. Answer: B
     B is correct because the project assumptions should be included in the project charter.
     A is incorrect because assumptions by definition represent uncertainty, and as a project
     manager, it is your responsibility to validate the assumptions at various stages of the
     project.
     C is incorrect because it is not the correct definition of assumption.
     D is incorrect because you can start the project with the assumptions. All you have to
     do is validate them at various stages of the project and analyze them as part of risk
     management.

109. Answer: B
     B is correct because the project charter is created in the initiation stage, and it is an
     input item to creating the project scope statement, which in turn is an input to creat-
     ing the WBS.
     A is incorrect because the project charter is input to the Define Scope process that
     creates the project scope statement.
     C is incorrect because the WBS is created before schedule development, and the pro-
     ject charter is created before the WBS.
     D is incorrect because the project scope statement is an input item to creating the
     WBS.

110. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because the project staff assignments are the output of the
     Acquire Project Team process.
     B, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are output of the human resource
     planning process. These are parts of the human resource plan, a document created
     during human resource planning.
524   Part VI        APPENDIXES


        111. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the scope statement, the WBS document, and the
                WBS dictionary combined make the scope baseline against which all change requests
                will be evaluated.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because all these are true statements about the project scope
                management plan.

        112. Answer: C
                C is correct because, you, the project manager, create the WBS with help from the
                project team.
                A is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with help from the team.
                B is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with help from the team.
                The project sponsor can help as part of the team, however.
                D is incorrect because the customer does not create the WBS.

        113. Answer: D
                D is correct because benchmarking can be used in quality planning but not in human
                resource planning.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these are tools and techniques that can
                be used in human resource planning.

        114. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because a risk can have a negative or a positive effect on a pro-
                ject.
                B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements about project
                risks.

        115. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the Manage Stakeholder Expectations process belongs
                to project communication management.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these processes are part of the project
                human resource management.

        116. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because decision tree analysis is the technique used in quanti-
                tative risk analysis.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because brainstorming, the Delphi technique, and
                SWOT analysis are the valid information-gathering techniques used for identifying
                risks.
                                                     FINAL EXAM               Appendix C           525


117. Answer: C
     C is correct because secondary risks are those risks that arise as a result of risk
     responses.
     A is incorrect because a residual risk is a risk that remains after a response has been
     performed.
     B is incorrect because depending upon the nature of the secondary risk, it can have
     any priority.
     D is incorrect because the risk response will depend upon the analysis results of the
     risk.

118. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because an activity has external dependency when it relies on
     factors outside the project.
     B is incorrect because an activity Y has a mandatory dependency on activity X when Y
     inherently depends on X.
     C is incorrect because there is no such dependency called internal.
     D is incorrect because we have an external dependency here.

119. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because personal choices, such as lifestyles or political and reli-
     gious beliefs, should not be considered during these assignments.
     A, B, and D are incorrect answers because competency, availability, and salary require-
     ments (cost) are valid factors to be considered for staff assignments.

120. Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because conflict management is a technique used in the Man-
     age Project Team process.
     A, B, and C are incorrect because the conflict management technique is not used in
     these processes.

121. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because co-location is a technique used in the Develop Project
     Team process.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because the co-location technique is not used in these
     processes.

122. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because a bonus is not a tool available for project team man-
     agement.
     A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are tools available for the Manage
     Project Team process.
526   Part VI        APPENDIXES


        123. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because a virtual team is a tool for the Acquire Project Team
                process.
                A, C, and D are incorrect answers because a virtual team is a tool for the Acquire
                Project Team process.

        124. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the goal here is to develop a team that might consist
                of members with various levels of preparation and experience.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because these are good characteristics for a sound
                reward strategy.

        125. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because collaboration provides a win/win resolution.
                A is incorrect because avoidance provides a lose/lose resolution.
                C is incorrect because accommodation provides a lose/win resolution.
                D is incorrect because compromise provides a lose-win/lose-win resolution, and both
                parties might look at it as a lose/lose resolution.

        126. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the main purpose of the activity definition process is
                to prepare the activity list and determine attributes for each activity.
                B is incorrect because the WBS contains work packages, not activities.
                C is incorrect because scope planning determines how the project scope will be
                defined, verified, and controlled and how the WBS will be created.
                D is incorrect because the activity list is an input to schedule development.

        127. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the main purpose of the risk identification process,
                formally called Identify Risks, is to create the risk register, which contains a list of
                risks.
                A is incorrect because there is no PMI process with the name Define Risks.
                C is incorrect because the risk management planning process determines how to plan
                and execute the risk management activities.
                D is incorrect because risk response planning takes a list of risks (risk register) as
                input.
                                                    FINAL EXAM               Appendix C          527


128. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the quality audit is a technique for performing quality
     assurance.
     A and B are incorrect because the quality audit is a technique for performing quality
     assurance.
     D is incorrect because there is no such quality management process called Perform
     Quality Inspection.

129. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because each activity on the critical path has a zero float time,
     and therefore if an activity is delayed, it will delay the entire project.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because these are incorrect statements about the activities
     on the critical path.

130. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because the selected sellers list is an output of the Conduct
     Procurements process.
     B, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are the output of the Plan Procure-
     ments process.

131. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because there is no PMI process named Select Sellers in the
     PMBOK Guide, Fourth Edition.
     B, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these processes belong to procurement
     management.

132. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because there is no contract type named profit shared.
     A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these are valid contract types.

133. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because fixed price (or lump sum) is the most suitable contract
     type for a well-defined product.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because the product to be procured is well defined.
528   Part VI        APPENDIXES


        134. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because cost overrun is paid by the buyer, and the fee increases
                with the increase in cost as well.
                A is incorrect because the firm fixed price presents risks to both buyer and seller
                because the fixed price might turn out to be above or below the actual cost.
                C and D are incorrect because the fee in these cases does not rise with the rise of the
                actual cost.
                E is incorrect because in a time and material contract, there could be a cost overrun to
                be paid by the buyer, but unlike a contract in the category of cost plus percentage of
                cost, there is no increasing fee attached to the increasing cost.

        135. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the procurement documents should be rigorous
                enough to ensure consistent responses from different sellers that can be fairly com-
                pared to one another and flexible enough to allow the sellers to offer suggestions on
                better ways to satisfy the requirements.
                A is incorrect because it does not allow the sellers to be creative in offering solutions.
                B is incorrect because the documents must be rigid enough that each seller under-
                stands the requirements.
                D is incorrect because the requirements are set by the buyer, not by the seller.

        136. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because when managed properly, differences in opinion can
                lead to better decisions and increased productivity.
                A, B, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements related to conflict
                management.

        137. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because this is not the recommended approach toward adver-
                tising. It is a useful tool that can be used in the Request Seller Responses process.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because all of these are true statements about advertising as
                a tool in the Request Seller Responses process.

        138. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because approved change requests are an output of the inte-
                grated change control process and an input to the Direct and Manage Project Execu-
                tion process. Remember, execution is all about implementation.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are outputs of the Direct and Man-
                age Project Execution process.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix C           529


139. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the Manage Project Team process belongs to the pro-
     ject human resource management.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because all these processes are part of project integration
     management.

140. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because you might need to negotiate with functional managers
     to acquire project team members.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because negotiation is not one of the tools used in these
     processes, according to PMI.
     In real life, though, remember that negotiation is a very useful tool that can be used in
     countless situations.

141. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the administrative part of the project closure must be
     performed whenever the project closure is performed at the end of a project or at the
     end of each phase of a project.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about administrative
     closure.

142. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because releasing resources is part of the Close Project process.
     Remember, the formal name of the process is Close Project or Phase.
     A and B are incorrect because there are no PMI processes named Release Resources
     and Administrative Closure. Administrative closure is a procedure that is an output of
     the Close Project process.
     D is incorrect because resources are released during the Close Project or Phase
     process.

143. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because a Pareto diagram is a tool used in the Perform Quality
     Control process to rank errors based on the frequency of occurrences.
     B and C are incorrect because a Pareto diagram is a tool used to rank defects in the
     quality control process. Caution: Quality control tools can also be used in quality
     assurance. Pay attention to what a tool is being used for.
     D is incorrect because auditing is a technique used in the QA process.
530   Part VI        APPENDIXES


        144. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because the formula for cost variance is:
                    EV = BAC x (work completed / total work required)
                which means
                    EV = $600,000 x (10 miles / 30 miles) = $200,000
                    CV = EV - AC
                which means
                    CV = $200,000 - $150,000 = $50, 000
                A, C, and D are incorrect because if the correct formula is applied, these results will
                not be achieved.

        145. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because a CPI value greater than 1 means the cost perfor-
                mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than 1 means
                the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because a CPI value greater than 1 means the cost perfor-
                mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than 1 means
                the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.

        146. Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because the Close Project or Phase process is part of project
                integration management.
                A and B are incorrect because the Close Project or Phase process is part of project
                integration management.
                C is incorrect because monitoring and controlling is a process group, not a knowledge
                area.

        147. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because implementation of recommended actions can be the
                output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.
                A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are the output of the Close Project
                or Phase process.

        148. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the product accepted by the customer is an output of
                the Close Project or Phase process.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are valid input to the Close Project
                or Phase process.

149. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the risk probability and impact matrix is a tool for
     qualitative risk analysis.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are included in the risk register.

150. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because dynamic programming is a mathematical model, not a
     benefit measurement method.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because these are the valid project selection methods
     included in the category of benefit measurement methods.

151. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because a project can have positive as well as negative stake-
     holders.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because these are true statements.

152. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because change requests are approved or rejected by processing
     them through the integrated change control process.
     A is incorrect because there is no PMI process named Approve Changes.
     B and D are incorrect because schedule control and quality control can generate rec-
     ommendations for actions and requests for changes, but those actions and changes
     must be approved through the change control process.

153. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because the initiating process group contains two processes:
     Develop Project Charter and Identify Stakeholders.
     B is incorrect because there is no standard process named Develop Preliminary Project
     Scope Statement.
     C and D are incorrect because these processes belong to the planning process group.

154. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because a project manager is assigned to the project in the pro-
     ject charter, which is an output of the Develop Project Charter process in the initiat-
     ing process group.
     A and C are incorrect because a project cannot start until the project charter is
     approved and the project charter names the project manager.
     D is incorrect because human resource planning is a knowledge area and not a process
     group.
532   Part VI        APPENDIXES


        155. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the risk was discovered during execution and was not
                identified during planning.
                A is incorrect because executing is a process group and not a process.
                B is incorrect because the risk was discovered during execution and was not identified
                during planning.
                D is incorrect because quantitative risk analysis is performed during the planning
                stage.

        156. Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because it is a wrong statement about a program. A program
                is a set of related projects that can produce independent products for different cus-
                tomers.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are characteristics of a program.

        157. Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because changes are implemented by using the Direct and
                Manage Project Execution process.
                A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these items are outputs of the integrated
                change control process.

        158. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because you have already done the planning procurements
                work, as stated in the definition of the question.
                A is incorrect because you have just finished the plan procurements work.
                B and D are is incorrect because there are no standard processes with these names.

        159. Answer: D
                D is the correct answer because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the
                project stakeholders' expectations and keep them on the same page about the project
                objectives.
                A is incorrect because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the project
                stakeholders' expectations.
                B and C are incorrect because the differences about objectives (and conflicts among
                the team members) must be resolved. Different expectations from the project mean
                that the stakeholders are not on the same page about the project scope, and that can
                be damaging to the project.

     manner with the intention of solving it.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because by choosing any one of these options, you are not
     dealing with the problem directly and effectively.

161. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the first thing you should do about a change request is
     study its effects and process it through the change control process.
     A, C, and D are incorrect answers because the change first must go through the
     change control process.

162. Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because there is no such method as project-oriented program-
     ming used for project selection.
     A, B, and C are incorrect because these are valid project selection methods included in
     the category of mathematical models. Another method included in this model is
     dynamic programming.

163. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the code of conduct clearly states that any situation
     that can be looked upon as conflict of interest should be disclosed.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because you are not being upfront and open.

164. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because your job is to understand and resolve conflicts, not to
     create them.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because these are true statements.

165. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because this is not part of the PMP Code of Ethics and Pro-
     fessional Conduct.
     A, B, and D are all incorrect because these activities are included in the PMP Code of
     Professional Conduct.

166. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because project charter is produced in the initiating stage.
     B is incorrect because there is no standard document called the preliminary project
     scope statement in the PMBOK Guide, Fourth Edition.
     C and D are incorrect because the project management plan and project schedule are
     produced in the planning stage of the project.

        167. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because if in a foreign land you are asked to do something that
                is unethical and illegal in your home country, you are supposed to investigate whether
                it is illegal and unethical there as well.
                B and D are incorrect because you don't know yet whether the sponsor is asking you
                to do something illegal.
                C is incorrect because you think it is unethical and illegal, so you must investigate it.

        168. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because the Collect Requirements process belongs to the plan-
                ning process group.
                A and B are incorrect because these processes belong to the initiating process group.
                D is incorrect because the Acquire Project Team process belongs to the executing
                process group.

        169. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because if the project sponsor has cancelled the project, it's the
                end of the story, but you still need to close the project using the Close Project or
                Phase process.
                A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not the appropriate actions to take.

        170. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because the purpose of change control is to manage the
                changes, not necessarily oppose them.
                B, C, and D are incorrect because all these are valid purposes of the integrated change
                control process.

        171. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because once you have a list of activities, you can sequence
                them.
                A is incorrect because there are a number of processes that must be performed after
                preparing the list of activities and before scheduling the activities.
                B is incorrect because you must have a schedule before you can control it.
                D is incorrect because you must have a WBS before you can create a list of activities.

        172. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because qualitative risk analysis is performed before quantita-
                tive risk analysis, and planning is performed before executing.
                B is incorrect because qualitative risk analysis is performed before quantitative risk
                analysis.
                                                   FINAL EXAM              Appendix C           535


     C is incorrect because planning is performed before executing.
     D is incorrect because you must identify and analyze risks before you can control
     them.

173. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because you cannot control a schedule unless you have a
     schedule; it's common sense. (Remember Thomas Paine?)
     A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these processes need to be performed
     before you can develop the project schedule.

174. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the baseline should only be changed due to the
     approved changes in the factors that define or impact the baseline.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not reasons to change the baseline.

175. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because project management involves performing processes
     belonging to knowledge areas, and you use your experience and skills to perform those
     processes.
     A is incorrect because this is not the defining characteristic of project management.
     C is incorrect because project management is a discipline that exists independent of
     functional managers.
     D is incorrect because the size of the project is not a criterion for using project man-
     agement. Each project needs to be managed for efficient execution.

176. Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because the WBS is an output of the Create WBS process.
     A is incorrect because the project scope statement is a major output of the Define
     Scope process.
     B and C are incorrect because these items are parts of the project scope statement.

177. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because fairness, honesty, respect, and responsibility are the
     four fundamental values in the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by the PMI.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because one fundamental value is missing from each of
     these options.
536   Part VI       APPENDIXES


        178. Answer: C
                C is the correct answer because Theory Y managers trust their employees.
                A is incorrect because there is no standard management theory called Theory T.
                B is incorrect because Theory X managers think that employees dislike their work and
                will try to avoid it.
                D is incorrect because McClellands's theory states that the need for achievement,
                affiliation, and power motivates the employees. C is the more appropriate answer in
                this case.

        179. Answer: A
                A is the correct answer because your supervisor's comments are consistent with
                Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory.
                B is incorrect because socialism is not a management theory; it's an economic system
                theory, like capitalism.
                C and D are incorrect because these theories do not apply to the comments made by
                your supervisor.

        180. Answer: B
                B is the correct answer because:
                    The probability that OTF will not deliver is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4
                    The probability that ST will not deliver is 2/3
                    The probability that both will not deliver is 1/4 x 2/3 = 2/12 = 1/6 = 0.17
                A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are based either on miscalculations or
                on calculations based on incorrect understanding of probability.
