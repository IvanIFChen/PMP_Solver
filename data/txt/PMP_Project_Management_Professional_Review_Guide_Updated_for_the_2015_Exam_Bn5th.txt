Acknowledgments
I'd like to thank Vanina and Brett for an outstanding job writing this book. They were both
lifesavers and bore the brunt of the work. I enjoyed seeing how they gave the content a fresh
face, and their illustrations are terrific. I appreciate the diligence and the new ideas that
Vanina brings to these projects. Brett's insights were a great contribution to this edition as
well. He is a true friend and an outstanding leader. As always, it was a great pleasure to
work with Vanina and Brett.
    I also echo Vanina's thanks to Kenyon Brown, senior acquisitions editor, for the
Aopportunity to update this book.
    I also want to thank Neil Edde, former vice president and publisher at Sybex, for taking
that leap of faith on a crazy project management study guide idea way back when. Thanks,
Neil.
    Alexa Murphy, development editor, is the best. She had some great suggestions that
improved the content and kept us on track with deadlines just like a seasoned project
manager.
    A very big thanks goes to all of the instructors who use my books in their classrooms. I
appreciate you choosing Sybex and my books to help your students master PMP (R) concepts.
Thank you also to all of the readers who choose this book to help them study for the PMP(R)
exam.
--Kim Heldman

To start, thank you to the team at Sybex who devoted a great deal of effort toward making
this review guide come together successfully. It is incredible to see the amount of teamwork
and effort that goes into the making of a book. The process is certainly thorough, and there
are many people not named here who were key to producing a solid product. Once again,
thanks to all of you!
   I'd like to thank Kim Heldman for the opportunity of working together once again on
this book. Kim's warm, positive, and dynamic nature always make her a pleasure to engage
with. I'd also like to give a special, heartfelt thanks to Brett Feddersen. Brett worked tire-
lessly to produce a great product and always had the reader in mind. Not only was Brett's
positive attitude and outlook contagious, but he made the process fun, collaborative, and
memorable.
   Thank you to Kenyon Brown, our senior acquisitions editor, who saw the value of
updating this book and whose great and supportive personality always comes through on
the phone and in email. I appreciate you welcoming me back to the Sybex family!
   A tremendous thankyou to Alexa Murphy, development editor. With your guidance and
feedback, we were able to take this book to the next level, and I am thrilled with the result!
You ensured that everything stayed on course, and your recommendations were valuable
and instrumental in creating this finished product. It was absolutely wonderful having an
opportunity to work with you once again.

   A special thanks to the individuals who are such a big part of my life and who have
always influenced me in a magnificent way. This includes my family, Nicolas Mangano,
Marysil Mangano, Nicolas Mangano Jr., Carina Moncrief and her husband, Jonathan
Moncrief; and my beautiful nieces, Kaylee, Alyssa, Yasmin, and Rianna--you mean every-
thing to me! Thank you to Al Smith Jr., who is supportive and an inspiration to me--I
enjoy all of our adventures and accomplishments together! And finally, thank you to
Roshoud Brown, who always encouraged me to write and inspired me with his own words.
--Vanina Mangano

I could not have asked for two better contributors to work with on a book than Vanina
Mangano and Kim Heldman, and I want to thank them for the opportunity to join their
team in collaborating on this book. Vanina's talent, experience, and drive are extraordi-
nary, and she willingly shared her passion and knowledge with me. Her sense of humor and
attention to detail helped make the process fun and helped us deliver a superior product to
the reader. Kim Heldman is a superior mentor who freely shares her enthusiasm, knowl-
edge, humility, and leadership, and her contributions are what makes this book great. She
has consistently pushed me to believe in myself, helping me to grow into the best profes-
sional I can be. It has been an honor to work with this team and help other prepare to the
take the PMP(R) exam.
    Everyone needs their first opportunity, and I would like to thank Kenyon Brown for
giving me my first shot at contributing on a book. And I would also like to thank Alexa
Murphy and the editorial team for their push to make this product.
    A commitment of this size normally requires a compromise in another part of one's
life. Accordingly, I want to thank my three children, Kayla, Marcus, and Adric, for being
willing to have Papa retreat to working on this book. They all kept their sense of humor,
though, and they know that I will follow my wireless mouse anywhere. However, without
my wonderful wife April I would not have the successes in my life like finishing this book.
April is always there to hear my stories, talk me down after a bad day, laugh at my jokes,
share a movie with me, and encourage me to be even better than I thought I could be. There
is no greater cheerleader in all the world, and I am humbled that she cheers for me.
--Brett Feddersen

We would like to thank Liz Welch, copyeditor, who made sure grammar and spelling were
picture perfect; Rebecca Rider, proofreader, for catching those last little "oops"; and Dassi
Zeidel, production editor, who made sure everything flowed through the production pro-
cess. Thanks also to our compositor, and the indexer, Ted Laux. The book couldn't happen
without them.

Introduction
Congratulations on your decision to pursue the Project Management Professional (PMP (R))
credential, one of the most widely recognized credentials within the project management
industry. The PMP(R) credential is offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)), a
not-for-profit organization with thousands of members across the globe. PMI(R) has been a
long-standing advocate and contributor to the project management industry and offers sev-
eral credentials for those specializing in the field of project management.
   This book is meant for anyone preparing to take the PMP(R) certification exam as well
as individuals who are looking to gain a better understanding of A Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge, Fifth Edition (PMBOK(R) Guide). If you are studying
for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM(R)) exam, you may also find
this book useful because the CAPM(R) exam tests your knowledge of the PMBOK(R) Guide
contents.
   This review guide has been formatted to work hand in hand with PMP (R) : Project
Management Professional Exam Study Guide, 8th Edition, from Sybex. The Study
Guide provides a more comprehensive review of the concepts included on the exam
along with real-world examples. This review guide will reinforce these concepts and
provide you with further explanation and a handy reference guide to the project man-
agement processes within the PMBOK(R) Guide. You'll find references to the Study
Guide throughout this book, guiding you to where you may find additional information
as needed. With all of these great resources at your fingertips, learning and understand-
ing the PMBOK (R) Guide, along with other project management concepts, has certainly
become easier!


Book Structure
This book has been structured in a way that carefully follows the concepts of the PMBOK(R)
Guide, allowing you to understand how a project is managed from beginning to end. For
this reason, we will review the processes in the order of the process groups:
aOE   Initiating
aOE   Planning
aOE   Executing
aOE   Monitoring and Controlling
aOE   Closing
   We start by covering the project management framework and the PMI (R) Code of
Ethics and Professional Conduct and then move to a comprehensive review of the
process groups. You'll find that each chapter offers a concise overview of each project
management process and concept as well as the process inputs, tools and techniques,
and outputs. This structure allows you to go back and reference terms, definitions, and
descriptions at a glance.

Day of the Exam
After gaining the necessary prerequisites to sit for the exam, the PMP (R) exam itself serves
as the fi nal measure to earning your certification. You are already well ahead of the game
in preparing for the exam when you purchase this book. The preparation you put forth
will help you show up on the day of the exam in a calm and confident state. Throughout
the course of this book, you will fi nd sections that offer tips of what to do on the day of
xxiva*...    Introduction



the exam. While you are not allowed to take anything into the exam, you are given scratch
paper to work with during your exam. Using the tips in this book, before you begin the
exam, you can jot down notes that will free your mind to focus fully on the questions. In
the days leading up to the exam, we recommend that you practice creating your reference
sheet by memorizing the mnemonics, formulas, and other information that you will need.
   Clearly, standard test taking advice is relevant here, such as getting a good night's sleep,
eating a good breakfast, and going through relaxation exercises before you are called into
the exam room. In addition, during the exam:
aOE   Take the time to read through each question slowly and completely. Fully understanding
      what is being asked in the question can contribute greatly to getting the right answer.
aOE   You will be given the ability to mark a question if you are unsure of your answer or are
      unable to come up with the answer. Take advantage of this feature, so you can move on
      to the next question. At the end of the exam, you can come back and review your answers
      and take more time to answer questions that escaped your answer earlier in the process.
aOE   You have four hours to complete an examination of 200 questions. Tell yourself that
      it is more important to pass than it is to go home early. If it will help, write that state-
      ment at the top of your reference scratch paper so you can remind yourself of this ideal.
      In a 4-hour examination, it is possible to get fatigued and just want to be done with it.
      Make sure you keep your focus and energy on success.

 Professional Exam
   Review Guide
     Third Edition
Chapter   Project Foundation

                               Much of the focus and content of this book revolves heavily
                               around the information contained in A Guide to the Project
                               Management Body of Knowledge, Fifth Edition (PMBOK(R)
Guide), published by the Project Management Institute (PMI (R)). Because many exam ques-
tions will relate to the content of the PMBOK(R) Guide, it will be referenced throughout this
book, and we'll elaborate further on those areas that appear on the test.
   This chapter lays the foundation for building and managing a project. Understanding
project management from a broad and high-level perspective is important and will pre-
pare you to digest the rest of the information in this book. One of the concepts you will
learn is that of progressive elaboration, which the PMBOK(R) Guide defines as an itera-
tive process where each pass at a topic increases the level of detail in planning a project
when greater amounts of information and accurate estimates become available. In this
context, we want to start with an overview of the general framework that projects
operate in, and then we will get progressively more elaborate with defining what those
steps entail.



Day of the Exam

This book provides targeted content to help you review and prepare to take the Project
Management Professional (PMP(R) ) certification exam (PMP(R) exam). Through the course of
this book, we will be giving you tips on things you should do the day of the exam to help
you achieve the greatest opportunity to pass and then join the worldwide network of
certified project managers. Look for these tips throughout the book.




Defining a Project
Pop quiz: How do you tell the difference between a project and ongoing operations? Before
delving into the aspects of project management, it's important to determine whether what
you are dealing with is, in fact, a project. Projects are often confused with ongoing opera-
tions, and it's therefore important to understand how to define a project and know its
characteristics.
   Once you have determined that you are dealing with a project, all stakeholders will need
to be identified. To be considered successful, a project must achieve its objectives and meet
or exceed the expectations of the stakeholders.
                                                                     Defining a Project         3




                   For more detailed information on projects and stakeholders, see Chapter 1,
                   "What Is a Project?" in PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam
                   Study Guide, Eighth Edition (Sybex, 2015).




Project Characteristics
The characteristics of projects, as shown in Figure 1.1, are as follows:
    They are temporary in nature and have a definite start and finish.
    They produce a unique product, service, or result that didn't exist before.

F i g u r E 1 .1   Project



                                          Temporary


                                                                Clear start
                       Unique
                                                                and finish


                                            Project




   The unique deliverables from a project might include tangible products (a road or a
building), well-defi ned and specific services such as consulting or project management, and
business functions that support the organization. Projects might also produce a result or an
outcome, such as a document that details the fi ndings of a research study. The purpose of
a project is to achieve its goals and to conclude. Therefore, a project is considered complete
when one of the following occurs:
    The goals and objectives are accomplished to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
    It has been determined that the goals and objectives cannot be accomplished.
    The project is canceled.
   After its completion, a project's product, service, or result may become part of an ongo-
ing operation.


Operations
Operations are ongoing and repetitive, involving work that is continuous and without an
end date. Often, operations involve repeating the same processes and producing the same
results. Figure 1.2 shows the characteristics of operations. The purpose of operations is to
keep the organization functioning.
4         Chapter 1       Project Foundation



F i g u r E 1. 2     Operations



                                           Ongoing

                          Keeps
                       organization                               Repetitive
                       functioning


                                           Operation




   Unsure whether it is a project or an ongoing operation? Put it through the following test
to make a determination:
     Is it unique?
     Does the work effort have a limited time frame?


                     Remember that according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the temporary nature of a
                     project does not necessarily mean the duration of the project is short.


     Is there a way to determine when the project is completed?
     Is there a way to determine stakeholder satisfaction?
    If you answered yes to each question, then it is a project.


Progressive Elaboration
Progressive elaboration means the characteristics of the product, service, or result of the
project are determined incrementally and are continually refi ned and worked out in detail
as the project progresses. Product characteristics typically start out broad-based at the
beginning of the project and are iterated into more and more detail over time until they are
complete and fi nalized.


Stakeholders
A stakeholder is any person or group, including formal organizations, who are impacted
by the project or who can impact the project. The following are characteristics of various
stakeholders:
     They are individuals, groups, or organizations with a vested interest in the project.
     They are actively involved with the work of the project.
     They have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project.
                                                                        Defining a Projecta*...   5




   Identifying who these stakeholders are is not a onetime process, and it's important to
identify stakeholders at the onset of the project. Here are some examples of project stake-
holders, as shown in Figure 1.3.

    It's also important to note that stakeholders may have conflicting interests and that it
is the project manager's responsibility to manage stakeholder expectations. And when in
doubt, stakeholder conflicts should always be resolved in favor of the customer.
    The project sponsor, who is also a stakeholder, is generally an executive in the organiza-
tion with the authority to assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the project. The
project sponsor typically serves as the tiebreaker decision maker and is one of the people on
the project's escalation path.
    Stakeholders are identified early on within the life of the project and may change as the
project evolves. Failure to identify stakeholders may result in failure of the project itself
because unidentified stakeholders may not have their expectations satisfied if you do not
give them a way to voice what they expect. Understanding the level of influence of each
stakeholder is also critical to the success of the project.

Exam Essentials

Be able to describe the difference between projects and operations. A project is
temporary in nature with a definite beginning and ending date. Projects produce unique
products, services, or results. Operations are ongoing and use repetitive processes that
typically produce the same result over and over.




Defining Project Management
A project management framework provides the tools and techniques necessary for the
successful initiation, planning, and execution of a project. Project management is the
application of that framework to consistently deliver products and services to a stake-
holder's satisfaction. Project management may involve more than a single project. In the
bigger picture, a project may be part of a program, a portfolio, and/or a project man-
agement offi ce.



                 For more detailed information on project management basics, see
                 Chapter 1 of PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam Study
                 Guide, Eighth Edition.




Project Management
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project management is "the application of
knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project
requirements."
   Project managers are the people responsible for managing the project processes and
applying the tools and techniques used to carry out the project activities. It is the responsi-
bility of the project manager to ensure that project management techniques are applied and
followed. In addition to this, project management is a process that includes initiating a new
project, planning, putting the project plan into action, and measuring and reporting on per-
formance. It involves identifying the project requirements, establishing project objectives,
balancing constraints, and taking the needs and expectations of the key stakeholders into
consideration.
   Project management itself can exist beyond the management of a single project.
In some organizations, programs and portfolios are also managed. Figure 1.4 shows
the characteristics of a project, program, portfolio, as well as a project management
office (PMO).

Programs
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, programs are groups of related projects, subprograms,
and program activities that are managed in a coordinated fashion, allowing them to capi-
talize on benefits that wouldn't be achievable otherwise.
    Each subproject within a program has its own project manager, who reports to the pro-
gram manager. All the projects are related and are managed together so that collective ben-
efits are realized and controls are implemented and managed in a coordinated fashion. The
management of this collection of projects--determining their interdependencies, managing
their constraints, and resolving issues among them--is called program management.


                   PMI(R) offers a certification for program management in addition to its
                   project management certification. For more detailed information on pro-
                   gram management skills, see The Standard for Program Management,
                   Third Edition (PMI(R), 2013).


Portfolios
Portfolios are collections of programs and projects that support a specific business goal or
objective. Programs and projects included as part of a portfolio may not necessarily relate
to one another in a direct way.
   Portfolio management encompasses managing the collection of programs, projects,
other work, and sometimes other portfolios. It also concerns monitoring active projects for
adherence to objectives, balancing the portfolio among the other investments of the organi-
zation, and assuring the efficient use of resources.


                   PMI(R) also offers a credential for portfolio management called the Portfolio
                   Management Professional (PfMP). For more detailed information on port-
                   folio management skills, see The Standard for Portfolio Management, Third
                   Edition (PMI(R), 2013).

Project Management Office
The project management office (PMO) is a centralized organizational unit that oversees the
management of projects and programs throughout the organization.
  The PMO is responsible for the following:
aOE      Managing the objectives of a collective set of projects
aOE      Managing resources across the projects
aOE      Managing the interdependencies of all the projects within its authority
aOE      Maintaining and archiving project documentation for future reference
aOE      Measuring project performance of active projects and suggesting corrective actions
aOE      Evaluating completed projects for their adherence to the project plan
aOE      Suggesting corrective actions pertaining to projects and programs as needed
   The most common reason a company starts a project management office is to establish
and maintain procedures and standards for project management methodologies and to man-
age resources assigned to the projects in the PMO. Project managers and team members may
report directly to the PMO, or the PMO may provide support functions for projects and
project management training or simply have experts available to provide assistance.
   The overall purpose of a project manager and PMO differ to a certain extent. A project
manager is focused on the project at hand, whereas the PMO takes more of an organiza-
tional approach to project management. The project manager is concerned with the project's
objectives; the PMO is concerned with the organizational objectives. Table 1.1 outlines the
differences between the overall objectives and perspectives of a project manager and PMO.

Reporting                   Project reporting                  Consolidated reporting


   PMOs can exist in any type of organizational structure. A major benefit for project man-
agers working in an organization that has an existing PMO is the room for advancement
that a PMO provides.
   Although PMOs are common in organizations today, they are not required in order to
apply good project management practices.

Exam Essentials

Be able to differentiate between project management, program management, port-
folio management, and a project management office. Project management brings
together a set of tools and techniques to describe, organize, and monitor the work of
project activities; program management refers to the management of groups of related
projects; portfolio management refers to the management of a collection of programs
and projects that support a specific business goal or objective; and the project man-
agement office oversees the management of projects and programs throughout the
organization.




Identifying Project Management Skills
To be successful, a project manager must possess general management skills that span every
area of management--from accounting and strategic planning to supervision, personnel
administration, and so forth. Some projects also require specific skills in certain application
areas, such as within an industry group, within a department, or by technical specialty.
These skills prepare the project manager to communicate, solve problems, lead, and negoti-
ate through a project.


                   For more detailed information on project management skills, see Chapter 1 of
                   PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.

  As shown in Figure 1.5, seven general management skills make up the foundation of
good project management practices.

10a*...     Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



Communication Skillsa* a* Many forms of communication exist within a project and are
critical to its success. It is the job of the project manager to ensure that the information is
explicit, clear, and complete. Once the information has been distributed, it is the responsi-
bility of the recipient to confirm that the information has been understood. Good project
managers spend up to 90 percent of their time communicating. This makes communication
skills a critical asset for a project manager.
Organization and Planning Skillsa* a* Organization and planning skills are closely related
and an important skill set that a project manager should possess. Project managers must
track and locate many documents, meetings, contracts, and schedules. Doing so requires
time management skills, which is why this skill set is tied closely to organizational skills.
Because there isn't any aspect of project management that doesn't first involve planning, it
will be an area discussed extensively throughout this book.
Budgeting Skillsa* a* Project managers establish and manage budgets and are therefore
expected to have some knowledge of finance and accounting principles. Cost estimates are
an example of when budgeting skills are put to use. Other examples include project spend-
ing, reading and understanding vendor quotes, preparing or overseeing purchase orders,
and reconciling invoices.
Conflict Management Skillsa* a* Conflict management involves problem solving, first
by defining the causes of the problem and then by making a decision to solve it. After
examining and analyzing the problem, the situation causing it, and the available
alternatives, determine the best course of action. The timing of the decision is also
important.
Negotiation and Influencing Skillsa* a* Both negotiation and influencing skills are necessary
in effective problem solving and are used in all areas of project management. The following
terms are related to this skill set:
     Negotiationa* a* Whether one on one or with teams of people, negotiation involves work-
     ing with others to come to an agreement and is necessary in almost every area of the
     project.
     Influencinga* a* Influencing requires an understanding of the organization's structure and
     involves convincing the other party to consider the choice you think is the better one
     even if it is not what they want.
     Powera* a* Power is a technique used to influence people and is the ability to get people to
     do things they wouldn't otherwise do.
     Politicsa* a* Politics involves getting groups of people with different interests to cooperate
     creatively even in the midst of conflict and disorder.
Leadership Skillsa* a* Leadership involves exhibiting characteristics of both a leader and a
manager and knowing when to switch from one to the other throughout the project. A
leader imparts vision, gains consensus for strategic goals, establishes direction, and inspires
and motivates others. Managers focus on results and are concerned with getting the job
done according to requirements.

Team Building and Motivating Skillsa* a* The project manager sets the tone for the project
team and walks the team members through various stages of team development to become
fully functional. This can involve team-building groundwork and motivating the team even
when team members are not direct reports.

Understanding Organizational
Structures
Like projects, organizations are unique, each with its own style and culture, which both
have an influence on how projects are performed. Organizations in general can be struc-
tured in one of three ways:
aOE   Functional
aOE   Matrix
aOE   Projectized
    Within these structures, variations and combinations exist. Figure 1.6 shows where
these structures fall in relation to one another, including the variations that exist in matrix
organizations. Knowing the type of structure that an organization operates within is
important and impacts how a project manager may proceed. The organizational structure
is part of the project environment, which influences how the project is managed. One of
the biggest determining factors of an organization's structure is the authority that a project
manager holds.

  Since functional and projectized are the two extreme types of organizational structures,
we'll cover them first.

                  ment Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.



Functional Organizations
Functional organizations are the oldest style of organization; the functional style is known
as the traditional approach to organizing businesses. These types of organizations have the
following characteristics:
     They center on specialties.
     They are grouped by function.
     They are displayed as a hierarchy.
    Importantly, workers within a functional organization specialize in an area of exper-
tise, allowing them to become very good at their specialty (such as Accounting, Human
Resources, or Engineering).
    Within this hierarchical structure, a chain of command exists in which employees
report to one manager and one person is ultimately in charge at the top. Each department
or group is managed independently and has a limited span of control, therefore requiring
that the chain of command be followed when input from another department on a project
is needed. The mind-set behind this type of structure is that people with similar skills and
experiences are easier to manage as a group, allowing for work assignments to be distrib-
uted and managed easily, and supervisors are experienced in the area they supervise.
    Table 1.2 highlights the advantages and disadvantages of a functional organization.

Ta b l E 1 . 2   Functional organizations

There is an enduring organizational structure.      Project managers have little to no formal

Projectized Organizations
Projectized organizations are nearly the opposite of functional organizations, focusing on the
project itself and therefore developing loyalties to the project and not to a functional manager.
                                           Understanding Organizational Structuresa*...        13




   Project managers have high to ultimate authority within this type of organization and
typically report directly to the CEO. The project manager makes decisions regarding the
project, including dealing with constraints. As a side note, project managers in all organiza-
tional structures must balance competing project constraints such as these:
aOE   Scope
aOE   Quality
aOE   Schedule
aOE   Budget
aOE   Resources
aOE   Risk
   Within a projectized organization, teams are often co-located, meaning that team mem-
bers physically work at the same location and report to the project manager. Once the proj-
ect is completed, the team is often dissolved and members are either put on the bench or let
go. Resource utilization can be inefficient if a highly specialized skill is needed only at given
times throughout the project and sits idle during other times.
   Table 1.3 highlights the advantages and disadvantages of a projectized organization.

Matrix Organizations
Matrix organizations are a blend of functional and projectized organizations, taking
advantage of the strengths of both and combining them into one. Employees report to a
functional manager and to at least one project manager.
   Functional managers assign employees to projects and handle administrative duties,
whereas project managers execute the project and assign project activities to employees.
Both share the responsibility of performance reviews.
   Within matrix organizations exists a balance of power ranging from that of a functional
organization to that of a projectized organization:
Strong Matrixa* a* A strong matrix organization has characteristics of a projectized
organization, where the project manager has a high level of authority and can dictate
resources.
14a*...   Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



Weak Matrixa* a* On the other end of the spectrum is the weak matrix, which holds a resem-
blance to a functional organization in that the functional managers have a greater level of
power and tend to dictate work assignments.
Balanced Matrixa* a* In between a strong matrix and weak matrix is the balanced matrix,
where the power is balanced between the project managers and functional managers.
   Table 1.4 shows the subtle differences between the three types of matrix organizations.
The majority of organizations today are a composite of functional, projectized, and matrix
structures.

                                          Understanding the Project Environmenta*...         15




Understanding the Project Environment
The project environment is made up of internal and external factors that influence a
project. When managing a project, the project manager must consider more than just the
project itself. Proactively managing a project involves understanding the environment in
which the project must function.
   The following are some examples of the elements that make up the project environment:

Organizational Structurea* a* The organizational structure itself plays a large role in how a
project is managed and is a major influential factor within the project environment. This is
intermingled with the company culture.

Physical Environmenta* a* The physical environment includes considerations such as the
following:
aOE   Local ecology
aOE   Physical geography
aOE   Environmental restrictions, such as protected areas or protected wildlife
aOE   Amount of dedicated office and conference room space

Cultural and Social Environmenta* a* When referencing the cultural environment, consider
these various layers:
aOE   Corporate culture, including external stakeholders and vendors. This is intermingled
      with organizational structures but can take on a life of its own
aOE   Ethnic culture
aOE   Religious culture
aOE   Organizational risk tolerance
To communicate effectively with customers, stakeholders, and project team members, it
becomes necessary to understand cultural and social factors and how they may impact
a project. In particular, cultural differences pose a common communication obstacle
within projects. As virtual and global projects become a more common scenario, under-
standing how to function within this type of environment becomes critical.
A project manager should also understand how the project impacts individuals and how
individuals impact the project.
International and Political Environmenta* a* The international and political environment
involves considering the following:
aOE   International, national, regional, and local laws and regulations
aOE   Norms and customs
aOE   Political climate
aOE   Time zone and local holidays
16a*...        Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



It is important for a project manager to know, from the onset of the project, whether any of
the items listed affect their particular project. Something as minor as a time zone difference
or as large as the political climate can have a huge impact on a project.
   There are other influential factors far beyond those listed here, and the list can become
quite extensive. On a basic level, these factors provide you with an overview of a project
from a broader perspective.



Understanding Project Life Cycles
and Project Management Processes
Most projects begin with an idea. After soliciting support and obtaining approval, a project
progresses through the intermediate phases to the ending phase, where it is completed and
closed out. As a project passes through this life cycle, it is carried out through a set of proj-
ect management processes. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, these processes are interre-
lated and dependent on one another; they are divided into five project management process
groups:
aOE       Initiating
aOE       Planning
aOE       Executing
aOE       Monitoring and Controlling
aOE       Closing
   Each of these process groups displays characteristics that reflect the level of a project's costs,
staffing, chances for successful completion, stakeholder influence, and probability of risk.
   Figure 1.7 shows the project management process groups and represents the life cycle of
a project or project phase.

                  For more detailed information on the project management life cycle and
                  processes, see Chapter 1 of PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam
                  Study Guide, Eighth Edition.


Project Phases and Project Life Cycles
Most projects are divided into phases. Project phases consist of segments of work, and a
project may have one or many phases, depending on the project complexity and industry.
The phases that a project progresses through are collectively called the project life cycle.
Project life cycles are similar for all projects, and the phases that occur within the project
life cycle are sequential and sometimes overlap.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, all projects follow the same life-cycle structure:
    Starting the project, or initiating
    Organizing and preparing, or planning the work of the project
    Carrying out (or performing) the work of the project, or executing
    Closing out the project



Exam Essentials

The PMBOK(R) Guide emphasizes that you should not confuse this generic life-cycle struc-
ture with the project management process groups because the processes in a process
group will consist of activities that may be performed and recur within each phase of a
project as well as for the project as a whole.


   At the beginning of a phase, a feasibility study may be carried out. At the end of a phase,
a phase-end review of the accomplished deliverables may be performed before handoff to
the next phase can occur. The following list expands further on several key terms used
within this description of what occurs within a phase:
Handoffs For the project to progress from one phase to the next, the phase deliverables
should be reviewed for accuracy and approved. As each phase is completed, it's handed off
to the next phase. Handoffs, or technical transfers, are phase sequences that signal the end
of one phase and typically mark the beginning of the next.
Feasibility Studies Some projects incorporate feasibility studies in the beginning phase.
They are completed prior to the beginning of the next phase. A feasibility study determines
whether the project is worth undertaking, or worth continuing if it is at a project check-
point, and whether it will be profitable to the organization.
Deliverables Each phase has at least one deliverable that marks the phase completion. A
deliverable is a tangible output that can be measured and must be produced, reviewed, and
approved to bring the phase or project to completion.
18        Chapter 1      Project Foundation



Phase-End Reviews At the end of a phase, a phase-end review may take place so that
those involved with the work may determine whether the project should continue on to the
next phase. Phase-end reviews, also known as phase exits, phase gates, milestones, stage
gates, decision gates, and kill points, give the project manager the ability to identify and
address errors discovered during the phase.
Phase-to-Phase Relationships As previously indicated, a project may consist of one or
more phases. The PMBOK(R) Guide defi nes three types of phase-to-phase relationships:
         Sequential relationships, where one phase must finish before the next phase can begin
         Overlapping relationships, where one phase starts before the prior phase completes
         Iterative relationships, where work for subsequent phases is planned as the work of
         the previous phase is performed


                  Organizations will differ in terms of size, maturity, and complexity. In terms
                  of the application of project management practices, some organizations
                  will have established policies that standardize all projects. Other organi-
                  zations will allow the project team great flexibility in selecting the most
                  appropriate approach for their project. Remember, project management is
                  not a "one size fits all" model.

   The act of overlapping phases to shorten or compress the project schedule is called fast-
tracking. This means that a later phase is started prior to completing and approving the
phase or phases that come before it.


Project Management Process Groups
Project management processes organize and describe the work of the project. As mentioned
earlier, the following are the five process groups described in the PMBOK(R) Guide:
     Initiating process group
     Planning process group
     Executing process group
     Monitoring and Controlling process group
     Closing process group
   These processes are performed by people; they are interrelated and dependent on one
another and include individual processes that collectively make up the group. The five pro-
cess groups are iterative and might be revisited and revised throughout the project's life as
the project is refi ned.
   The project manager and the project team are responsible for tailoring, which involves
determining which processes within each process group are appropriate for the project.
When the project is tailored, its size and complexity and various inputs and outputs are
taken into consideration. The conclusion of each process group allows the project manager
          Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processesa*...             19




and stakeholders to reexamine the business needs of the project and determine whether the
project is satisfying those needs.
Initiating Process Groupa* a* The processes within the Initiating process group occur at the
beginning of the project and at the beginning of each project phase for large projects. This
process group grants the approval to commit the organization's resources to working on the
project or phase and authorizes the project manager to begin working on the project.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Initiating process group contains the following
actions:
    aOE   Developing the project charter, which formally authorizes the project
    aOE   Identifying project stakeholders
Planning Process Groupa* a* The Planning process group includes processes that formulate and
revises project goals and objectives. It is also where the project management plan that will be
used to achieve the goals the project was undertaken to address is created. Within this pro-
cess group, project requirements are fleshed out and additional stakeholders are identified.
Because projects are unique, planning must encompass all areas of project management.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Planning process group contains the following
actions:
    aOE   Developing the project management plan
          The project management plan itself contains several subsidiary plans and base-
          lines. This collection of plans defines how the project will be planned, carried out,
          and closed.
    aOE   Planning and creating the scope management plan
          The component of the project management plan is the process that documents the
          method that will be used to define, control, and validate project scope.
    aOE   Collecting project requirements
          The project requirements define and document the needs of the stakeholders.
    aOE   Developing the project and product's scope
    aOE   Creating the work breakdown structure (WBS)
          The WBS contains a decomposition of the project work, from the major deliver-
          ables down to the work packages.
    aOE   Planning and creating the schedule management plan
          Another component of the project plan, the schedule management plan creates
          documentation and policies/procedures for development of the project schedule as
          well as the managing, executing, and controlling of its elements.
    aOE   Identifying the project activities necessary to carry out the project work
    aOE   Developing the order and duration of project activities
    aOE   Calculating the number of resources needed to carry out the project activities
20a*...          Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



          aOE   Creating the project schedule
          aOE   Planning and creating the cost management plan
                The cost management plan documents and describes how projects costs will be
                managed through the entire project life cycle.
          aOE   Identifying the cost of all of the activities needed for project success
          aOE   Developing the project's budget
          aOE   Estimating the cost of each project activity
          aOE   Planning and creating the quality management plan
                The quality management plan sets the standards for the project and also defines
                the quality requirements.
          aOE   Creating the human resource plan
                This plan outlines how human resources will be identified and managed.
          aOE   Creating the communications management plan
                This plan defines how communications will be carried out throughout the course
                of the project, including identifying and meeting the communication needs of
                stakeholders.
          aOE   Creating the risk management plan
                This plan outlines how risk management will be conducted. It also provides the
                necessary information to consistently identify and measure project risk.
          aOE   Identifying project risks
                This process also results in the creation of the risk register, where information
                about the identified risks will be documented.
          aOE   Assessing and prioritizing project risks that require further analysis or action, as
                well as the numerical analysis of risk on the overall project objectives
          aOE   Developing risk responses
          aOE   Creating the procurement management plan
                The procurement management plan documents and describes how external prod-
                ucts or services will be acquired.
          aOE   Planning and creating the plan for stakeholder engagement
                Stakeholder engagement focuses on the continuous activities needed to keep stake-
                holders informed, gain their feedback, and ensure their expectations are met.
Executing Process Groupa* a* The Executing process group involves putting the project man-
agement plan into action, keeping the project plan on track, and implementing approved
changes.
The project manager coordinates and directs project resources, and costs are high-
est here since greater amounts of time and resources are utilized during the Executing
processes.
          Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processesa*...             21




According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Executing process group contains the following
actions:
    aOE   Performing the work defined in the project management plan
    aOE   Ensuring that the quality standards and operational definitions outlined in the
          Planning process group are followed according to the quality management plan
    aOE   Auditing the quality requirements
    aOE   Obtaining the human resources needed to complete the project work
    aOE   Enhancing the skills and interactions of the project team as well as the overall
          team environment
    aOE   Managing the project team and enhancing its performance
    aOE   Distributing the necessary information throughout the course of the project, as
          outlined within the communications management plan
    aOE   Selecting the external vendors used and awarding the necessary procurement contracts
    aOE   Managing the expectations of the stakeholders
Monitoring and Controlling Process Groupa* a* The Monitoring and Controlling process
group is where project performance measurements are taken and analyzed to determine
whether the project is staying in line with the project plan. This process group tracks the
progress of work being performed and identifies problems and variances within a process
group and the project as a whole.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, processes from within the Monitoring and
Controlling process group contain the following actions:
    aOE   Monitoring and controlling the work of the project, such as making sure the actual
          work performed is in line with the project management plan
    aOE   Using the integrated change control system to review, approve or deny, and man-
          age all changes within the project
    aOE   Accepting the completed project deliverables
    aOE   Controlling the project and product scope
          This helps prevent scope creep and makes sure the project accomplishes what it set
          out to do.
    aOE   Controlling the project schedule to make sure the project is completed on time
    aOE   Controlling the project costs to make sure the project is completed within the
          allotted budget
    aOE   Monitoring the results of conducting quality activities
          This allows for an assessment of performance.
    aOE   Reporting the project performance through planned reports
          This also involves forecasting and measuring project performance.
    aOE   Implementing risk response plans
22a*...          Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



          aOE   Monitoring and controlling risks
                This includes monitoring the project for any new risks and evaluating the effective-
                ness of risk responses and risk management processes.
          aOE   Managing vendor relationships and vendor contracts
          aOE   Monitoring the relationships with project stakeholders and adjusting approaches as
                warranted
Closing Process Groupa* a* The Closing process group includes processes that bring a for-
mal, orderly end to the activities of a project phase or to the project itself. Once the project
objectives have been met, all the project information is gathered and stored for future refer-
ence. Contract closeout also occurs within this process group, and formal acceptance and
approval are obtained from project stakeholders.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the closing process group contains the following
actions:
          aOE   Finalizing the project work to formally complete the project or project phase
          aOE   Completing and then closing out all vendor contracts
   The progression through the project management process groups exhibits the same char-
acteristics as progression through the project phases. Table 1.5 shows the characteristics of
the process groups.

Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle
As the project progresses and more information becomes known, the project management
processes might be revisited and revised to update the project management plan. Underlying
the concept that process groups are iterative is a cycle called the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle,
                             Recognizing Professional and Social Responsibilitya*...          23




which was originally defined by Walter Shewhart and later modified by Edward Deming.
The idea behind this concept is that each element in the cycle is results oriented and
becomes input into the next cycle. The cycle interactions can be mapped to work in con-
junction with the five project management process groups.



Exam Essentials

Be able to name the five project management process groups.a* a* The five project manage-
ment process groups are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and
Closing.




Day of the Exam

You are not allowed to bring anything into the testing room when you take the exam.
However, you will be given scratch paper as an aid. An excellent approach to take the test
is to memorize formulas, acronyms, and mnemonics before you begin taking the test, and
then write these all out on the sheet of blank scratch paper provided. This will allow you
to focus exclusively on what is being asked on the test instead of taking brain power to
try to remember these elements while answering a question.

PMPa*(R) Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition mentions an
acronym for the process groups that is helpful: it sounds like IPECC (Initiating, Planning,
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing), where you think of Monitoring and
Controlling simply as "Controlling." Give it a try and see if it helps.




Recognizing Professional and Social
Responsibility
A PMP(R) credential comes with several responsibilities that involve decisions and actions
you make. When submitting your PMP (R) application, you are agreeing to abide by the PMIa*(R)
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This oath touches on several elements within
your personal and professional life and includes actions that are mandatory as well as
actions and ideals to which we aspire.
   Maintaining ethical and professional conduct applies to day-to-day activities and is
therefore applicable to everything discussed earlier in this chapter and throughout the rest
of the book. Meeting ethical and professional standards is an essential part of building a
solid project management foundation. For the exam, you will be expected to be familiar
with the code and answer questions based on its contents.
24        Chapter 1      Project Foundation




PMI(R) Core Values
The PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct addresses the following four elements:
responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty.



Responsibility
Responsibility is a major part of upholding integrity. It involves taking ownership for your
actions, being proactive in doing the right thing, and doing what is necessary to resolve a
situation that results from an initial lack of responsibility.
   As shown in Figure 1.8, a variety of elements touch on the concept of responsibility:
     Ensuring a high level of integrity
     Accepting only those assignments for which you are qualified
     Following rules, regulations, laws, and policies
     Respecting confidential information
     Upholding the PMI(R) Code of Ethics and holding fellow project managers
     accountable


F i g u r E 1. 8   Elements of responsibility



                                            Ensuring
                                            integrity



                                                            Accepting
                            Following                      assignments
                                          Responsibility
                            the rules                        you are
                                                           qualified for



                                           Respecting
                                           confidential
                                           information




                   Responsibility involves making decisions that are for the good of the orga-
                   nization rather than for yourself. It also involves admitting your mistakes
                   and being accountable for the decisions you make and the consequences
                   that result from those decisions and actions.
                               Recognizing Professional and Social Responsibility                25




Ensuring Integrity
As a project manager, one of your professional responsibilities is to ensure integrity of the
project management processes, the product, and your own personal conduct. This can
entail the following:
    Applying the project management processes correctly to ensure integrity of the product
    Executing the process groups effectively to ensure the quality of the product
    Obtaining formal acceptance of the project and product

Accepting Assignments
Accepting appropriate assignments is tied to responsibility and honesty. This involves doing
the following:
    Accurately and truthfully reporting your qualifications, experience, and past perfor-
    mance of services to potential employers, customers, PMI(R), and others
    Declining assignments beyond your capabilities or experience
    Emphasizing your knowledge and how you've used it in your specific industry as
    opposed to making others believe that you have experience using certain processes and
    tools if, in reality, you don't
    Accurately representing yourself, your qualifications, and your estimates in your adver-
    tising and in person
    Completing the commitments that you undertake and ensuring that you do what it is
    you say you will do

Following the Rules
It is imperative that you follow all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including these:
    Industry regulations
    Organization rules
    Project rules
    PMI(R) organizational rules and policies
    Intellectual property and other ethical standards and principles governing your industry
    Local, national, and international law governing your location, processes, and product


                    Rules or regulations that apply in one country may or may not apply in
                    other countries.


Respecting Confidential Information
Whether you are a direct employee, a consultant, or a contractor, it is likely that during the
course of your project management career you will come across some form of sensitive infor-
mation. You may collect or be exposed to sensitive information as part of a project. You may
26a*...        Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



be required to provide such information to a contractor. You may have access to this type
of information as part of your role. Whatever the situation, it is important that you comply
with the PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, which states that you agree not to
disclose sensitive or confidential information or use it in any way for personal gain.
   Handling company data, trade secrets, data from governmental agencies, and intellec-
tual property are typical cases in which you will come across sensitive or confidential infor-
mation. Don't forget to ask yourself the key questions shown in Figure 1.9 whenever you
handle information. If you are unsure of the answer to any of the questions, find out before
you share the information.

F i g u r e 1 . 9 a* a* Handling information


                                               Ask Yourself:

                                    Is this      Can this         Does a
                                 information   information     nondisclosure
                                  private or   be shared?       agreement
                                  protected?                      exist?


Trade Secretsa* a* An organization's trade secrets or private information should not be used
for personal gain. Understanding what information may be shared with vendors, other
organizations, or even coworkers is important. In practice, there are often gray areas where
the breach of information is not as obvious. Being conscious and sensitive about your orga-
nization's information can make a big difference. If ever in doubt, always ask.
Restricted Accessa* a* Working with the government is a great example of when data shar-
ing can be sensitive. One governmental agency does not always have access to data from
another, separate governmental agency. Depending on the data, others may have restricted
access or no access at all. Restricted access isn't limited to governmental data; similar
restrictions occur in the private sector as well. One department within an organization may
not always have access to data from another department. Think of the sensitive nature of
information housed within the human resources department. An employee's file may not
always be accessible to department heads or others. It is a mistake to assume that others
should have access to data because you believe it is logical that they do.
Nondisclosure Agreementsa* a* It is your responsibility to make sure vendors or organizations
that will have access to sensitive data sign and understand the appropriate nondisclosure
agreements before you release the data. Clearly, make sure there is key stakeholder support,
including from the legal department, in the release of sensitive information.

Intellectual Property
You are likely at some point to come into contact with intellectual property. The busi-
ness or person who created the protected material or item owns the intellectual property.
Intellectual property typically includes the following items:
aOE       Items developed by an organization that have commercial value but are not tangible
aOE       Copyrighted or trademarked material, such as books, software, and artistic works
                               Recognizing Professional and Social Responsibilitya*...            27



aOE   Ideas or processes that are patented
aOE   An industrial process, a business process, or a manufacturing process developed by the
      organization for a specific purpose
   You might have to pay royalties or request written permission to use the property.
Intellectual property should be protected just like sensitive or confidential data.

Respect
Demonstrating respect involves how you conduct yourself, the way you treat others and the
resources around you, and listening to the viewpoints of others. Respect is something that
should be exhibited on a personal and professional level. Among other things, the level of
respect you earn will be based on how well you do the following:
aOE   Exhibit a professional demeanor
aOE   Handle ethics violations
aOE   Demonstrate a sense of cultural awareness
aOE   Interpret experiences

Exhibiting Professional Demeanor
Exhibiting a professional demeanor is an important part of business. You are responsible
for your own actions and reactions. Here are some examples of maintaining a professional
demeanor and encouraging professional demeanor within others:
aOE   Controlling your emotions and your reactions in questionable situations.
aOE   Notifying the project team during the kickoff meeting where they can find a copy of
      organizational policies regarding conflict of interest, cultural diversity, standards and
      regulations, customer service, and standards of performance.
aOE   Coaching and influencing team members who exhibit nonprofessional attitudes or
      behaviors to conform to the standards of conduct expected by you and your organiza-
      tion. As the project manager, it is your job to ensure that team members act profession-
      ally because they represent you and the project.

Reporting Ethics Violations
One of the responsibilities that falls to you as a project manager is the responsibility to
report violations of the PMP (R) code of conduct. To maintain integrity of the profession,
PMP(R) credential holders must adhere to the code of conduct that makes all of us account-
able to one another. This includes notifying PMI(R) when you know a violation has occurred
and you've verified the facts. The PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes
the following violations:
aOE   Conflicts of interest
aOE   Untruthful advertising
aOE   Falsely claiming PMP(R) experience and credentials
aOE   Appearances of impropriety
28        Chapter 1      Project Foundation



Demonstrating Cultural Awareness
As project teams and organizations become increasingly more diverse, the need for a height-
ened awareness of cultural influences and customary practices becomes critical. Today, it's
common for project teams to be spread out globally. It is rare not to come into contact with
someone from another culture. For example, you may encounter some or all of the following:
     Virtual project teams with team members based in different physical locations
     Internal project stakeholders spread among offices globally
     Offshore vendors or suppliers
     Offshore partners
     Project team members who, while physically located in the same office, are from differ-
     ent cultures
   It is important not to attempt to force your own culture or customs on others. When in
a different country, you will need to respect the local customs. At the same time, it is not
acceptable to do something that violates your ethics and the ethics of your company.


                  Do not forget that cultural awareness is an important component in your
                  own country as well. Citizens of the same country can often have differ-
                  ent cultural influences and customs, which should be recognized and
                  respected.

   As part of cultural awareness, you will need to be proactive in protecting yourself and
your staff from experiencing culture shock. In order to do this, it becomes important to
devote time to diversity training as needed, and to always demonstrate respect for your
neighbors, as follows:
Culture Shock Working in a foreign country can bring about an experience called culture
shock. Culture shock involves a separation from what you would normally expect. This can
cause disorientation, frustration, breakdown of communication, and confusion. Here are
some ways to prepare yourself and protect against culture shock (Figure 1.10):
         Read about the country you're going to work in before you go.
         Become familiar with customs and acceptable practices in foreign countries where
         you have dealings or will be visiting.
         When in doubt about a custom or situation, ask your hosts or a trusted contact
         from the company for guidance.

Diversity Training Project team members may be from different countries or cultures.
Providing your team members with training helps to prevent cultural or ethical differences
from impacting the project.

Diversity training makes people aware of differences between cultures and ethnic groups
and helps them gain respect and trust. Training involving the company culture should also
be provided so that project team members understand how the organization functions.

                                                   ask!




Building Relationshipsa* a* Some cultures require that a relationship be established before busi-
ness can be conducted. Building that relationship may take days, depending on the culture.
   Building relationships is valuable, regardless of whether or not a culture requires it. On
the flip side, as you are building relationships, remember that you should not impose your
beliefs on others because that is not the purpose of building relationships. Instead, building
a relationship with others creates an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation. In this
environment, all aspects of project planning and management, including negotiating and
problem solving, become easier and smoother to navigate.

Interpreting Experiences
As part of exhibiting respect, it's important to be conscious of how experiences are inter-
preted and perceived. This is relevant on both ends of the communication spectrum. Others
may interpret your actions in a way that you did not intend. Likewise, you may misinter-
pret the actions of others. Remember the following:
aOE   Each member of your team brings a unique set of experiences to the project. Those
      experiences influence perception, behavior, and decisions.
aOE   Your perception of a situation is influenced by your experiences and might be very dif-
      ferent from the perceptions of others.
aOE   Always give others the benefit of the doubt and ask for clarification if you think there
      is a problem.
aOE   Avoid allowing feelings or emotions to get in the way of how you interpret a situation.
30a*...        Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



Fairness
As part of the PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, you have a responsibility to
report to the stakeholders, customers, or others any actions or circumstances that could be
construed as a conflict of interest. Avoiding conflicts of interest is a part of exhibiting fair-
ness. Fairness includes the following:
aOE       Treating everyone equally, without favoritism or discrimination
aOE       Appropriately representing yourself and your organization to avoid conflict-of-interest
          situations, and quickly reporting any situation if conflict of interest occurs
aOE       Maintaining impartiality in your decision-making process
   A conflict of interest involves putting your personal interests above the interests of the
project or using your influence to cause others to make decisions in your favor without
regard for the project outcome. As Figure 1.11 illustrates, any of the following could be
construed as conflicts of interest and compromise fairness:
aOE       Not revealing your active associations and affiliations
aOE       Accepting vendor gifts
aOE       Using stakeholder influence for personal reasons
aOE       Participating in discrimination

                                               stakeholder
                                                influence




Associations and Affiliations
In maintaining associations and affiliations, it's important to consider whether any con-
flicts of interest exist as a result. For instance, sitting on the decision-making committee
of a company that wins a bid for a contract relating to your project constitutes a conflict
of interest. Even if you do not influence the decision in any way, others will assume that a
                              Recognizing Professional and Social Responsibility                  31




confl ict of interest occurred. This is also the case in personal associations--for instance,
awarding a project to a relative, spouse, and so forth.
  When these types of situations occur, do the following:
    Inform the project sponsor and the decision committee of the association or affiliation.
    Refrain from participating in the award decision committee.
    In cases of a contract with a personal association, appoint someone else in your organi-
    zation to administer the contract and make the payments for the work performed.
    Document all of the decisions you make regarding the activities performed by the asso-
    ciation and keep them with the project files.

Vendor Gifts
Vendor gifts are not uncommon. Vendors and suppliers often provide their customers and
potential customers with lunches, gifts, ballgame tickets, and the like. However, some
professionals are not allowed to accept gifts in excess of a certain dollar amount. This
might be driven by company policy or the department manager's policy. Accepting ven-
dor gifts may be construed as a confl ict of interest, no matter how small the gift is. It is
your responsibility to know the policy on accepting gifts and inform the vendor if they go
beyond the acceptable limits. Likewise, do not give inappropriate gifts to others or attempt
to influence a decision for personal gain.


                  Don't accept gifts that might be construed as a conflict of interest. If your
                  organization does not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for
                  yourself.



Stakeholder Influence
Some stakeholders have a large amount of authority. It is important not to put your own
personal interests above the interests of the project or organization when dealing with pow-
erful stakeholders. This is another potential area for confl ict of interest. Keep in mind these
guidelines:
    Weigh your decisions with the objectives of the project and the organization in mind--
    not your own personal gain.
    Do not use stakeholder influence for personal gain, such as receiving a promotion,
    bonus, or similar reward.

Discrimination
Maintaining a strong level of fairness is important on many levels, as you have seen so far.
In practice, we sometimes fall prey to favoritism without realizing it. When issuing assign-
ments, promotions, and the like, always use strong professional reasoning when making
decisions. Choosing someone simply because you enjoy working with them is poor judg-
ment and represents a confl ict of interest.
32a*...        Chapter 1a*  a* Project Foundation



   It is also important to be conscious of discriminating against others. Whether based on
age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or personality, discrimination on any level is
not acceptable. Remember that the PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct also
requires you to report this type of behavior exhibited by someone else.

Honesty
You should be aware of several aspects of honesty that you must uphold (as shown in
Figure 1.12):
aOE       Reporting the truth regarding project status and circumstances
aOE       Avoiding deception
aOE       Making only truthful statements
aOE       Being honest about your own experience

F i g u r e 1 .1 2 a* a* Elements of honesty



                                               Reporting
                                               the truth

                                               experience




Reporting Truthfully
Honesty involves information regarding your own background and experience as well as
information about the project circumstances. Benefit to the project, and not your personal
gain, should be the influencing factor when billing a customer or working on a project.
Experiencing a personal gain as a result of your work is positive, but making a project
decision simply to result in a personal gain is not.
   As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information
in your possession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public
when required. This includes situations where personal gain is at stake. Always being
truthful about the situation and also being up front regarding the project's progress is
important.
                             Recognizing Professional and Social Responsibilitya*...          33




Avoiding Deception
At times, being honest can feel difficult. In some cases, it may result in the end of a project,
losing a job, missing out on a bonus, or other consequences that impact you and your team
personally. Deceiving others and making false statements to prevent unfavorable conse-
quences are not acceptable ways of handling situations. In terms of a project, being up front
and telling the truth are necessities.

Making Truthful Statements
Part of managing a good team involves leading by example. This includes making truth-
ful statements, not just on your PMP(R) application, but in the day-to-day management of a
project. In some cases, delicate situations may present themselves, which is where your gen-
eral management skills come into play. Being truthful doesn't mean being disrespectful, and
a project manager must understand how to balance both.

Representing Personal Experience
Being honest about your personal experience is just as important as not deceiving others.
You may have heard that enhancing a resume is a standard practice in business. While cre-
ating a resume that greatly highlights your experiences and credentials is recommended,
exaggerating experience or clearly embellishing credentials is unacceptable. This is equiva-
lent to making false statements.
   Correctly representing yourself naturally applies to your PMP (R) application. Accurately
stating your work experience, credentials, and background is an important part of main-
taining high integrity.
   The project management community has put together a variety of resources for you
to help communicate the values of the PMI(R) Code of Ethics, including video tutorials
describing ethical conduction. Additionally, tools are available to help you work through a
dilemma if you find yourself unsure of what to do in a certain situation. For more informa-
tion, please visit the PMI(R) website at www.pmi.org/en/About-Us/Ethics.aspx.



Advancing the Industry
Promoting good project management and advancing the industry are part of your role as a
project management professional. Professional knowledge involves the knowledge of project
management practices as well as specific industry or technical knowledge required to complete
an assignment. As part of maintaining your credential, you have the following responsibilities:
aOE   To apply project management knowledge to all your projects
aOE   To educate others regarding project management practices by keeping them up-to-date
      on best practices, training your team members to use the correct techniques, informing
      stakeholders of correct processes, and then sticking to those processes throughout the
      course of the project
aOE   To promote interaction among stakeholders
34        Chapter 1        Project Foundation



   Becoming knowledgeable in project management best practices and staying abreast of
the industry are important. Figure 1.13 touches on these responsibilities.

                     While the PMP (R) exam is not expected to test your knowledge of this topic,
                     the continuing credential requirements will become important to maintain-
                     ing your credential.



Enhancing Your Industry Knowledge
Furthering knowledge in the field of project management (your own and others) is a part
of your responsibility as a project manager. Project management is a growing field, which
makes staying abreast of project management practices, theories, and techniques an ongo-
ing process. For this reason, PMI(R) requires that, once you achieve your PMP(R) certification,
you maintain the credential by earning a given number of professional development units
(PDUs) every three years. PDUs ensure that your knowledge of the industry and project
management practices remains current. There are several ways of earning PDUs, such as
taking project management classes, reading industry books and magazines, speaking on the
subject of project management, and so forth. You can fi nd additional details on the PMI(R)
website (www.PMI.org).
   Here are some ways that you can further and enhance your project management
education:
     Join a local PMI(R) chapter.
     Join a PMI(R) Community of Practice (CoP).
     Read the PMI(R) monthly magazine.
     Take educational courses offered through PMI(R) chapters or other project management
     training companies.
                              Recognizing Professional and Social Responsibilitya*...         35




   Remember that as a project manager, you should be proactive in looking for ways to fur-
ther enhance your skills and knowledge of the industry.

Contributing to the Industry
As a project manager you have the responsibility of not only furthering your own level of
knowledge and skill set, but also contributing to the knowledge base itself. This includes
actions such as the following:
aOE   Coaching and mentoring others within the field
aOE   Contributing to the knowledge base itself, such as through volunteer efforts, writ-
      ing articles relating to project management, and conducting research and studies that
      enhance or add to the industry
aOE   Supporting other project managers

Promoting Stakeholder Interaction
Within a project, there can be a small handful to dozens of stakeholders. The greater the
number of stakeholders, the more complex project communication and control become.
Throughout this book, we review how stakeholders tend to have varying interests.
Although everyone wants the project to succeed, the agendas may vary. Ways to promote
interaction among stakeholders include the following:
aOE   Working toward balancing their interests, requirements, and expectations
aOE   Reducing the amount of conflict within the project
aOE   Encouraging collaboration among the departments
   Be sure to apply all of the stakeholder management techniques that we will cover later in
this book from within the Project Communications Management Knowledge Area.

                              Initiating is the fi rst of the five project management process
                              groups as defi ned by the Project Management Institute (PMI (R)).
                              Initiating acknowledges that a new project (or the next phase
within a project) should begin. This process group culminates in the publication of a proj-
ect charter and a stakeholder register.
   Before diving into the Initiating process group, we'll provide a high-level review of the
ten Project Management Knowledge Areas, which is another way of classifying the project
management processes. This review offers a high-level look at the Knowledge Areas and
insight as to how they are tied into the five process groups.
   The Initiating process group accounts for 13 percent of the questions on the Project
Management Professional (PMP(R)) exam.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and descriptions
                 of the project management process groups and related materials and fig
                 ures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide to the Project Man-
                 agement Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide), Fifth Edition (PMI(R), 2013).



Understanding the Project Management
Knowledge Areas
Throughout the project life cycle, a project utilizes a collection of processes that can be
classified by the five process groups mentioned in Chapter 1, "Project Foundation." They
are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Processes
can also be classified into 10 categories called the Project Management Knowledge Areas,
which bring together processes that have characteristics in common. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, the 10 Knowledge Areas are as follows:
    Project Integration Management
    Project Scope Management
    Project Time Management
    Project Cost Management
    Project Quality Management
    Project Human Resource Management
    Project Communications Management
                       Understanding the Project Management Knowledge Areas                     41



     Project Risk Management
     Project Procurement Management
     Project Stakeholder Management
   Processes within the Knowledge Areas are grouped by commonalities, whereas processes
within the project management process groups are grouped in more or less the order in
which you perform them. Once again, these are two ways of classifying the same set of
project management processes. Processes interact with other processes outside of their own
Knowledge Area and, in many cases, are repeated multiple times as needed.


                    For more detailed information on the Project Management Knowledge
                    Areas, see Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter," of PMP (R): Project Man-
                    agement Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition (Sybex, 2016).



Day of the Exam

For the 10 Project Management Knowledge Areas, think of a phrase where each word
begins with the first letter of each Knowledge Area, such as:

I   (Integration)
Saw (Scope)
Two (Time)
Cool (Cost)
Quails (Quality)
Hanging (Human Resources)
Closely (Communications)
Pruning (Procurement)
Sails (Stakeholder)
Using mnemonics is a great way of memorizing key information, and it makes preparing
for the exam fun!



Project Integration Management
The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area consists of six processes. Table 2.1
lists the processes and the process group for each. The Project Integration Management
Knowledge Area involves identifying and defi ning the work of the project and combining,
unifying, and integrating the appropriate processes. This is the only Knowledge Area that
contains processes across all five of the project management process groups. The processes
within Project Integration are tightly linked because they occur continually throughout the
project, meaning that they are iterative in nature.

                   As a recap, remember that processes can be categorized by Knowledge
                   Area and also by process group. The five project management process
                   groups are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and
                   Closing.


     The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area involves the following:
      Identifying and defining the work of the project
      Combining, unifying, and integrating the appropriate processes
      Managing customer and stakeholder expectations and meeting stakeholder
      requirements
   The following tasks are typical of those performed during work covered by the Project
Integration Management Knowledge Area:
      Making choices about where to concentrate resources
      Making choices about where to expend daily efforts
      Anticipating potential issues
      Dealing with issues before they become critical
      Coordinating the work for the overall good of the project
      Making trade-offs among competing objectives and alternatives

Project Scope Management
The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area consists of six processes. Table 2.2
lists the processes and the process group for each. These processes are interactive and
define and control what is strategically included versus intentionally excluded from the
project scope.

   The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area encompasses the following:
Project Scopea* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project scope identifies the work that
needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features
and functionality. This is typically measured against the project management plan.
44a*...        Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project



Product Scopea* a* Product scope addresses the features and functionality that character-
ize the product, service, or result of the project. This is measured against the product
specifications to determine successful completion or fulfillment. Product scope entails
the following:
aOE       Detailing the requirements of the product of the project
aOE       Verifying those details using measurement techniques
aOE       Creating a scope management plan
aOE       Creating a work breakdown structure (WBS)
aOE       Controlling changes to these processes
   The following tasks are typical of those performed during work covered by the Project
Scope Management Knowledge Area:
aOE       Collecting the project requirements
aOE       Defining the overall project scope
aOE       Measuring the project against the project management plan, project scope statement,
          and WBS
aOE       Measuring the completion of a product against the product requirements
   Keep in mind that the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area is concerned with
making sure the project includes all the work required to complete the project--and only
the work required to complete the project successfully.

Project Time Management
The Project Time Management Knowledge Area consists of seven processes. Table 2.3
lists the processes and the process group for each. On small projects, the Sequence
Activities, Estimate Activity Durations, and Develop Schedule processes are completed as
one activity.

      The Project Time Management Knowledge Area involves the following:
aOE    Keeping project activities on track and monitoring those activities against the project plan
aOE    Ensuring that the project is completed on time
   The flow of the Project Time Management Knowledge Area is very intuitive. First, the
project activities are identified and put into the order in which they will occur. Next, the
resources are estimated for each activity, along with the estimated duration. Finally, the
project schedule is developed and controlled as the project work moves forward.
   Figure 2.3 shows the highlights of the Knowledge Area's purpose.

The Project Cost Management Knowledge Area consists of four processes. Table 2.4
lists the processes and the process group for each. For small projects, Estimate Costs and
46a*...        Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project



Determine Budget may be combined into a single process. Remember that your ability to
influence cost is greatest at the beginning of the project. Minimal resources have been used
in comparison with other stages. Therefore, changes made during these processes have a
greater impact on cost reduction, and your opportunities to effect change decline as you
move deeper into the project.

Control Costs                                           Monitoring and Controlling


      The Project Cost Management Knowledge Area involves the following:
aOE       Establishing cost estimates for resources
aOE       Establishing budgets
aOE       Ensuring that the project is executed within the approved budget
aOE       Improving the quality of deliverables through two techniques: life-cycle costing and
          value engineering
    Life-cycle costing and value engineering are used to improve deliverables. The following
is a brief overview of these two techniques:
Life-Cycle Costinga* a* Life-cycle costing is an economic evaluation technique that determines
the total cost of not only the project (temporary costs) but also owning, maintaining, and
operating something from an operational standpoint after the project is completed and
turned over.
Value Engineeringa* a* Value engineering is a technique that looks for alternative product ideas
to make certain the team is applying the lowest cost for the same or better-quality results.
So, for example, if the original engineer suggests a custom part for a step of the production
process, a value engineering review might suggest an alternative that can use a readily avail-
able, lower-cost standard part that will produce the same output for a better value.
  These are typical tasks performed during work covered by the Project Cost Management
Knowledge Area:
aOE       Developing the cost management plan
aOE       Considering the effects of project decisions on cost
aOE       Considering the information requirements of stakeholders

It is important to know what process group and Knowledge Area a process belongs to. In some
instances, the name of a process can reveal this information. For example, the Control Costs
process belongs to the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area and the Monitoring and
Controlling process group. Be on the lookout for similar clues to make memorization a cinch!

Project Human Resource Management
The Project Human Resource Management Knowledge Area consists of four processes.
These processes organize, develop, and manage the project team. Table 2.6 lists the pro-
cesses and the process group for each. Because the makeup of each team is different and the
stakeholders involved in the various stages of the project might change, project managers use
different techniques at different times throughout the project to manage these processes.

      The Project Human Resource Management Knowledge Area involves the following:
aOE    Overseeing all aspects of people management and personnel interaction
aOE    Ensuring that the human resources assigned to the project are used in the most effec-
       tive way possible
aOE    Practicing good project management by knowing when to enact certain skills and com-
       munication styles based on the situation
   The Project Human Resource Management Knowledge Area also includes enhancing the
skill and efficiency of the project team, which, in turn, improves project performance.
   Keep in mind that the project management team and project team are different. The
project management team is the group of individuals responsible for planning, control-
ling, and closing activities. They are considered to be the leadership team of the project.
The project team is made up of all the individuals that have assigned roles and responsi-
bilities for completing the project. They are also referred to as the project staff.

Project Risk Management
The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area consists of six processes, some of which
may be combined into one step. Table 2.8 lists the processes and the process group for
each. Risks include both threats to and opportunities within the project.

   The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area involves the following:
    Identifying, analyzing, and planning for potential risks, both positive and negative,
    that may impact the project
    Minimizing the probability and impact of negative risks, and increasing the probability
    and impact of positive risks
    Identifying the positive consequences of risk and exploiting them to improve project
    objectives or discover efficiencies that may improve project performance
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a risk is an uncertain event or condition that has a
positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. Every project has some level of
uncertainty and, therefore, some level of risk. Keep in mind that a risk is different from an
issue. A risk may or may not occur. But when a negative risk materializes and impacts the
project, it becomes an issue that must be handled.
   Figure 2.8 shows the highlights of the Knowledge Area's purpose.

                 types of risks, including positive versus negative risks.



Project Procurement Management
The Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area consists of four processes. Table 2.9
lists the processes and the process group for each. While reviewing the procurement
52a*...   Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project



processes, remember that you are viewing the process from the perspective of the buyer,
and that sellers are external to the project team. Together, these four processes allow you
to manage the purchasing activities of the project and the life cycle of the procurement
contracts.

   The Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area involves purchasing goods or
services from vendors, contractors, suppliers, and others outside the project team.
   Keep in mind that a contract can be simple or complex; contracts can be tailored to the
needs of the project. The PMBOK(R) Guide defines a contract as an agreement that binds the
seller to provide the specified products or services; it also obligates the buyer to compensate
the seller as specified.

54        Chapter 2      Initiating the Project




Performing a Project Assessment
Before an organization decides to embark on a project, several considerations must take
place, such as an assessment of the various potential projects. As part of performing
a project assessment, management will need to evaluate existing needs and demands,
perform feasibility studies, and use project selection methods to help in making good
decisions.
   Project assessment should entail a careful evaluation of information carried out through
meetings with the sponsor, customer, and other subject matter experts. This group of key
individuals will then determine whether the new products or services are feasible under the
existing assumptions and constraints.


Initiating a Project
Project initiation is the formal recognition that a new project, or the next phase in an exist-
ing project, should begin and that resources may be committed to the project. A project
may come about as a result of a need, demand, opportunity, or problem. Once those needs
and demands are identified, the next logical step may include performing a feasibility study
to determine the viability of the project.


                  For more detailed information on initiating a project, including a closer look
                  at the project selection methods and a case study, see Chapter 2 of PMP (R):
                  Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.



Identifying Needs and Demands
Needs and demands represent opportunities, business requirements, or problems that need
to be solved. Management must decide how to respond to these needs and demands, which
will, more often than not, initiate new projects. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, projects
come about as a result of one of the following seven needs or demands:
Market Demand The demands of the marketplace can drive the need for a project. Some
companies must initiate projects in order to take advantage of temporary and long-term
market changes.
Strategic Opportunity/Business Need An organization may respond to an internal need
that could eventually affect the bottom line. For example, this may include addressing com-
pany growth or even the need to downsize.
Customer Request      A new project may emerge as a result of internal or external customer
requests.
Technological Advance New technology often requires companies to revamp their prod-
ucts as a way of taking advantage of the latest technology.

Legal Requirementa* a* Both private industry and government agencies generate new projects
as a result of laws passed during every legislative season.
Environmental Considerationa* a* Many organizations today are undergoing a greening effort
to reduce energy consumption, save fuel, reduce their carbon footprint, and so on.
Social Needa* a* Projects arise out of social needs, such as a developing country that offers
medical supplies and vaccination in response to a fast-spreading disease.


Conducting a Feasibility Study
Some organizations require that a feasibility study take place prior to making a final deci-
sion about starting a project. Feasibility studies may be conducted as separate projects, as
subprojects, or as the first phase of a project.
   When evaluating the feasibility of new products or services, it's generally a good idea to
meet with the sponsor, customer, and other subject matter experts. Here are some of the
reasons that a feasibility study may be undertaken:
aOE   To determine whether the project is viable
aOE   To determine the probability of success
aOE   To examine the viability of the product, service, or result of the project
aOE   To evaluate technical issues related to the project
aOE   To determine whether the technology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily assimi-
      lated into the existing technology structure


Selecting a Project
As shown in Figure 2.11, an organization may choose to use a variety of selection methods.
Selection methods help organizations decide among alternative projects and determine the
tangible benefits to the company of choosing or not choosing a project. Project selection
methods are also used to evaluate and choose between alternative ways to implement the
project.

                   Although project selection is considered to be out of the scope of a project
                   manager's role, the project selection methods we'll talk about next are
                   ones you should be familiar with for the exam.

   Depending on the organization, a steering committee may be responsible for project
review, selection, and prioritization. A steering committee is a group comprising senior
managers and, sometimes, mid-level managers who represent each of the functional areas
in the organization.
   There are generally two categories of selection methods:
      Mathematical models (also known as constrained optimization methods)
      Benefit measurement methods (also known as decision models)

Mathematical Models
For the exam, simply know that mathematical models, also known as constrained optimi-
zation methods, use the following in the form of algorithms:
      Linear
      Dynamic
      Integer
      Nonlinear
      Multi-objective programming

Benefit Measurement Methods
Benefit measurement methods, also known as decision models, employ various forms of
analysis and comparative approaches to make project decisions. These methods include
comparative approaches such as these:
      Cost-benefit analysis
      Scoring models
      Cash flow analysis techniques


                   When applying project selection methods, you can use a benefit measure
                   ment method alone or in combination with others to come up with a selec
                   tion decision.

     Let's take a closer look at the benefit measurement methods.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
Cost-benefit analysis, also known as cost analysis or benefit analysis, compares the cost to
produce the product, service, or result of the project with the benefit that the organization
will receive as a result of executing the project.

Scoring Models
For weighted scoring models, the project selection committee decides on the criteria that
will be used on the scoring model. Each of these criteria is then assigned a weight depend-
ing on its importance to the project committee. More important criteria should carry a
higher weight than less important criteria. Each project is then rated on a numerical scale,
with the higher number being the more desirable outcome to the company and the lower
number having the opposite effect. This rating is then multiplied by the weight of the crite-
ria factor and added to other weighted criteria scores for a total weighted score. The project
with the highest overall weighted score is the best choice.
   For example, if Project A contains a weighted score of 31, Project B contains a weighted
score of 42, and Project C contains a weighted score of 40, which project would you
choose? The correct answer is Project B, since it has the highest weighted score.
Cash Flow Analysis Techniques
The final benefit measurement methods involve a variety of cash flow analysis techniques:
aOE    Payback period
aOE    Discounted cash flows
aOE    Net present value
aOE    Internal rate of return
      Figure 2.12 provides an overview of the cash flow analysis techniques.

      Let's take a closer look at these techniques.
58a*...        Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project



Payback Period
The payback period is the length of time it takes the company to recoup the initial costs
of producing the product, service, or result of the project. This method compares the
initial investment to the cash inflows expected over the life of the product, service, or
result.



Payback Period Example

The initial investment on a project is $200,000, with expected cash inflows of $25,000 per
quarter every quarter for the first two years and $50,000 per quarter from then on. The
payback period is two years and can be calculated as follows:


          Initial investment = $200,000

          Cash inflows = $25,000

          Time frame = 4 quarters

          Total cash inflows per year = $100,000 (4 quarters x cash inflows of $25,000)

          Initial investment ($200,000) - year 1 inflows ($100,000) = $100,000 remaining balance

          Year 1 inflows remaining balance - year 2 inflows = $0

          Total cash flow year 1 and year 2 = $200,000


The payback is reached in two years.

The fact that inflows are $50,000 per quarter starting in year 3 makes no difference
because payback is reached in two years.

The payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow calculations because it does
not consider the time value of money.



Discounted Cash Flows
Money received in the future is worth less than money received today. Therefore,
you can calculate what the value of funds will be in the future by using the following
formula:
          FV = PV (1 + i)n
   This formula says that the future value (FV) of the investment equals the present value
(PV) times (1 plus the interest rate) raised to the value of the number of time periods (n) the
interest is paid.

Future Value Example

What is the value of $2,000 three years from today, at 5 percent interest per year?

    FV = $2,000 (1.05)3

    FV = $2,000 (1.157625)

    FV = $2,315.25


   The discounted cash flow technique compares the value of the future cash flows of the
project to today's dollars. It is literally the reverse of the FV formula. To calculate dis-
counted cash flows, you need to know the value of the investment in today's terms, or the
present value (PV). PV is calculated using the following formula:
    PV = FV (1 + i)n




Planned Value Example

If $2,315.25 is the value of the cash flow three years from now, what is the value today
given a 5 percent interest rate?

    PV = $2,315.25 x (1 + 0.05)3

    PV = $2,315.25 x 1.157625

    PV = $2,000

$2,315.25 three years from now is worth $2,000 today.


  To calculate discounted cash flow for the projects you are comparing for selection pur-
poses, apply the PV formula, and then compare the discounted cash flows of all the projects
against each other to make a selection.




Calculating Project Value Example

Project A is expected to make $100,000 in two years, and Project B is expected to make
$120,000 in three years. If the cost of capital is 12 percent, which project should you
choose?
60a*...        Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project




Using the PV formula shown previously, calculate each project's worth:

          PV of Project A = $79,719

          PV of Project B = $85,414

Project B is the project that will return the highest investment to the company and should
be chosen over Project A.


Net Present Value
Net present value (NPV) allows you to calculate an accurate value for the project in today's
dollars. NPV works like discounted cash flows in that you bring the value of future monies
received into today's dollars. With NPV, you evaluate the cash inflows using the discounted
cash flow technique applied to each period the inflows are expected instead of in one sum.
The total present value of the cash flows is then deducted from your initial investment to
determine NPV. NPV assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital.
   Here are some important notes on NPV calculations:
aOE       If the NPV calculation is greater than zero, accept the project.
aOE       If the NPV calculation is less than zero, reject the project.
aOE       Projects with high returns early in the project are better projects than projects with
          lower returns early in the project.
Internal Rate of Return
Internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate when the present value of the cash inflows
equals the original investment. When choosing between projects or when choosing alterna-
tive methods of doing a project, projects with higher IRR values are generally considered
better than projects with low IRR values.
   Keep the following in mind:
aOE       IRR is the discount rate when NPV equals zero.
aOE       IRR assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the IRR value.
aOE       You should choose projects with the highest IRR value.

Be familiar with payback period. Payback period is the amount of time it will take the
company to recoup its initial investment in the product of the project. It's calculated
by adding up the expected cash inflows and comparing them to the initial invest
ment to determine how many periods it takes for the cash inflows to equal the initial
investment.

Understand the concept of NPV and IRR. Projects with an NPV greater than zero should
be accepted, and those with an NPV less than zero should be rejected. Projects with high
IRR values should be accepted over projects with lower IRR values. IRR is the discount
rate when NPV is equal to zero and IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate.




Defining the HighLevel Project Scope
During the Initiating process group, the high-level project scope is defi ned and documented.
As the project moves into the Planning process group, the high-level scope is further elabo-
rated and defi ned. This is typically based on the business and compliance requirements and
is documented to meet the customer's expectations. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the
high-level project scope is contained within the project charter.


                 For more information on the project charter, see the section "Developing
                 the Project Charter" later in this chapter.

Be able to identify where the high-level scope is documented and what it is based
on. The highlevel scope is defined and documented within the project charter and is
based on the business and compliance requirements.




Identifying HighLevel Risks,
Assumptions, and Constraints
The Initiating process group focuses on documenting not only the high-level project scope,
as mentioned previously, but also high-level risks, assumptions, and constraints. This infor-
mation will be documented in the project charter and will be largely based on the existing
environment, historical information, and expert judgment.
62        Chapter 2      Initiating the Project



   As you may have noticed, this process group is concerned with setting a foundation
and common understanding of what the project is setting out to achieve. The Planning
process group will later expand on this high-level information by working out the gran-
ular details.

Developing the Project Charter
Creating the project charter is an important initial step to beginning any project
because it formally initiates the project in an organization and gives authorization
for resources to be committed to the project. The creation of this document involves
gathering and analyzing stakeholder requirements, which will lead the way for prop-
erly identifying and documenting the project and product scope, milestones, and
deliverables.
   The project charter document is created out of the fi rst process within the Project
Integration Knowledge Area, called Develop Project Charter. This document attempts to
not only formally recognize the project, but also identify project limitations and propose an
implementation approach. Until the project charter is created and formally approved, many
organizations do not recognize the project.
   The project charter documents the name of the project manager and gives that person
the authority to assign organizational resources to the project. It also documents the busi-
ness need, justification, and impact; describes the customer's requirements; sets stakeholder
expectations; and ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization. The project is
officially authorized when the project charter is signed.
   Figure 2.13 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Develop Project
Charter process.


                 For more detailed information on the project charter, see Chapter 2 of

Inputs of the Develop Project Charter Process
For the exam, you should know the following inputs of the Develop Project Charter
process:
aOE       Project statement of work (SOW)
aOE       Business case
aOE       Agreements
aOE       Enterprise environmental factors
aOE       Organizational process assets
      Let's look at each of these inputs more closely.
Project Statement of Worka* a* The project statement of work (SOW) describes the product,
service, or result the project was undertaken to complete. When the project is internal,
either the project sponsor or the initiator of the project typically writes this document.
When the project is external to the organization, it is the buyer that typically writes the
SOW. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a project SOW should contain or consider all of
the following elements:
aOE       Business need
aOE       Product scope description
aOE       Strategic plan

Business Casea* a* The purpose of a business case is to understand the business need for the
project and determine whether the investment in the project is worthwhile. Performing a
64a*...        Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project



feasibility study is a great first step in building the business case. Most business case docu-
ments contain the following items:
aOE       Description of the business need for the project
aOE       Description of any special requirements that must be met
aOE       Description of alternative solutions
aOE       Description of the expected results of each alternative solution
aOE       Cost-benefit analysis
aOE       Recommended solution

Agreementsa* a* The agreements input is applicable only when the organization you are work-
ing for is performing a project for a customer external to the organization. The agreement
is used as an input to this process because it typically documents the conditions under
which the project will be executed, the time frame, and a description of the work.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Enterprise environmental factors refer to the fac-
tors outside the project that may have significant influence on the success of the project.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the environmental factors, in relation to this process,
include but are not limited to the following items:
aOE       Governmental or industry standards, which include elements such as regulatory stan-
          dards and regulations, quality standards, product standards, and workmanship
          standards
aOE       Organizational culture and structure
aOE       Marketplace conditions, referring to the supply-and-demand theory along with eco-
          nomic and financial factors

Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Organizational process assets are the organization's poli-
cies, guidelines, procedures, plans, approaches, or standards for conducting work, includ-
ing project work.
   These assets include a wide range of elements that might affect several aspects of the
project. In relation to this process, organizational process assets refer to the following
items:
aOE       Processes, policies, templates, and procedures of the organization
aOE       Corporate knowledge base, such as historical information and lessons learned


Tools and Techniques of the Develop Project
Charter Process
The Develop Project Charter process has only two tools and techniques that you should be
familiar with: expert judgment and facilitation techniques. The concept behind expert judgment
is to rely on individuals, or groups of individuals, who have training, specialized knowledge, or
skills in the areas you're assessing. These individuals may be stakeholders, consultants, other
experts in the organization, subject matter experts, the project management office (PMO),
                                                     Developing the Project Chartera*...         65




industry experts, or technical or professional organizations. Facilitation techniques refer to the
application of the project management processes through the use of brainstorming, meeting
management, conflict resolution, and other techniques employed by the facilitators.
   In addition, you should be familiar with who is considered to be a key stakeholder. Key
project stakeholders include the following individuals:
Project Managera* a* The project manager is the person who assumes responsibility for the
success of the project. The project manager should be identified as early as possible in the
project and ideally should participate in writing the project charter. The following are
examples of what the role of project manager entails:
aOE   Project planning and managing the overall work of the project
aOE   Setting the standards and policies for the projects on which they work
aOE   Establishing and communicating the project procedures to the project team and stakeholders
aOE   Identifying activities and tasks, resource requirements, project costs, project require-
      ments, performance measures, and more
aOE   Keeping all stakeholders and other interested parties informed
Project Sponsora* a* The project sponsor is usually an executive in the organization who has
the power and authority to make decisions and settle disputes or conflicts regarding the
project. The sponsor takes the project into the limelight, gets to call the shots regarding
project outcomes, and funds the project. The project sponsor should be named in the proj-
ect charter and identified as the final authority and decision maker for project issues.
Project Championa* a* The project champion is usually someone with a great deal of techni-
cal expertise or industry knowledge regarding the project who helps focus attention on the
project from a technical perspective. Unlike the sponsor, the project champion doesn't nec-
essarily have a lot of authority or executive powers.
Functional Managersa* a* Project managers must work with and gain the support of func-
tional managers in order to complete the project. Functional managers fulfill the admin-
istrative duties of the organization, provide and assign staff members to projects, and
conduct performance reviews for their staff.


Outputs of the Develop Project Charter Process
The Develop Project Charter process results in a single, but critical, output: the project charter.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a useful and well-documented project charter should
include at least these elements:
aOE   Purpose or justification for the project
aOE   Project objectives that are measurable
aOE   High-level list of requirements
aOE   High-level description of the project
aOE   High-level list of risks
aOE   Summary milestone schedule
66a*...        Chapter 2a*  a* Initiating the Project



aOE       Summary budget
aOE       List of stakeholders known
aOE       Criteria for project approval
aOE       Name of the project manager and their authority levels
aOE       Name of the sponsor (or authorizer of the project) and their authority levels



Exam Essentials

Be able to list the Develop Project Charter inputs.a* a* The inputs for Develop Project
Charter are project statement of work, business case, agreements, enterprise environ
mental factors, and organizational process assets.

Be able to describe the purpose of the business case.a* a* The purpose of a business case is
to understand the business need for the project and determine whether the investment in
the project is worthwhile.




Obtaining Project Charter Approval
The project charter isn't complete until sign-off has been received from the project sponsor,
senior management, and key stakeholders. Sign-off indicates that the document has been
read by those signing it and that they agree with the contents and are on board with the
project. The signature signifies the formal authorization of the project. Acceptance of the
charter is also important to formalize the assignment of the project manager and their level
of authority.
   The last step in this process is publishing the charter. Publishing, in this case, simply
means distributing a copy of the project charter to the key stakeholders, the customer, the
management team, and others who might be involved with the project. Publication can take
several forms, including printed format or electronic format distributed via the company
email system or the company intranet.



Exam Essentials

Be able to describe the importance of the project charter.a* a* The project charter is the
document that officially recognizes and acknowledges that a project exists. The charter
authorizes the project to begin. It authorizes the project manager to assign resources
to the project and documents the business need and justification. The project charter
describes the customer's requirements and ties the project to the ongoing work of the
organization.
                                                Performing Key Shareholder Analysis                67




Performing Key Shareholder Analysis
Identifying stakeholders and performing analysis on key stakeholders is an important part
of setting the stage for a successful project outcome. Stakeholder analysis is carried out
through the Identify Stakeholders process and involves the use of brainstorming, interview-
ing, and several data-gathering techniques.
   By performing stakeholder identification and analysis, the project manager can better
document stakeholder expectations and ensure that the expectations are aligned with the
project objectives. It also serves as a way of gaining project support.



                     Project stakeholders are those people or organizations who have a vested
                     interest in the outcome of the project. They have something to either gain
                     or lose as a result of the project, and they have the ability to influence
                     project results.


   Identify Stakeholders is the fi rst process of the Project Stakeholder Management
Knowledge Area and part of the Initiating process group. This process involves identifying
and documenting all the stakeholders on the project, including their interests, impact, and
potential negative influences on the project. Stakeholder identification should occur as early
as possible in the project and continue throughout its life cycle.
   Figure 2.14 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Identify
Stakeholders process.

                  Chapter 2 of PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide,
                  Eighth Edition.




Inputs of the Identify Stakeholders Process
There are four inputs in the Identify Stakeholders process:
Project Charter In this process, the project charter provides the list of stakeholders along
with other individuals or organizations affected by the project.
Procurement Documents When the project is procured, the list of key stakeholders and
other relevant individuals or organizations may be obtained through the procurement
documents.
Enterprise Environmental Factors       The following enterprise environmental factors are
used in this process:
     Company culture
     Organizational structure
     Governmental or industry standards
     Local, regional, or global trends and practices
Organizational Process Assets The following organizational process assets pertain to this
process:
     Stakeholder register templates
     Lessons learned
     Stakeholder register from previous projects



                  In several instances, outputs of one process become inputs to another.
                  Notice that the output of the Develop Project Charter process--the project
                  charter--becomes an input to the Identify Stakeholders process. Under
                  standing how processes interact with one another is an important aspect
                  of the exam.




Tools and Techniques of the Identify Stakeholders
Process
The tools and techniques of Identify Stakeholders are stakeholder analysis, expert judg-
ment, and meetings.
                                              Performing Key Shareholder Analysisa*...            69




Stakeholder Analysisa* a* During stakeholder analysis, you'll want to identify the influences stake-
holders have in regard to the project and understand their expectations, needs, and desires. From
there, you'll derive more specifics regarding the project goals and deliverables. Stakeholders are
often concerned with their own interests and what they have to gain or lose from the project.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, three steps are involved in stakeholder analysis:
    1.   Identify all potential stakeholders and capture general information about them,
         such as the department they work in, contact information, knowledge levels, and
         influence levels.
    2.   Identify the potential impact or support each may have to the project, and then
         classify them according to impact so that you can devise a strategy to deal with
         them. The PMBOK(R)Guide lists four classification models for classifying the power
         and influence of each stakeholder on a simple four-square grid:
         aOE  Power/interest grid
         aOE  Power/influence grid
         aOE  Influence/impact grid
         aOE  Salience model (which charts stakeholder power, urgency, and legitimacy)
    3.   Assess the reaction or responses of the stakeholder to various situations. This will
         assist the project manager in managing the stakeholders.
Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment is used in combination with stakeholder analysis to
ensure that stakeholder identification is comprehensive. This may involve interviewing key
stakeholders that are already identified and senior management, subject matter experts, or
other project managers.
Meetingsa* a* Meetings are often used as a mechanism for performing stakeholder analysis.
Project managers often gather and analyze information on roles, positions, and interests of
stakeholders through meetings.

Outputs of the Identify Stakeholders Process
The Identify Stakeholders process has one output: stakeholder register.
Stakeholder Registera* a* A stakeholder register captures all of the information about the
stakeholders in one place. This general information includes things like the department
they work in, contact information, knowledge levels, and influence levels. In addition, the
stakeholder register contains at least the following:
   Identifying Informationa* a* This includes items like contact information, department, role
   in the project, and so on.
   Assessment Informationa* a* This includes elements regarding influence, expectations, key
   requirements, and when the stakeholder involvement is most critical.
   Stakeholder Classificationa* a* Stakeholders can be classified according to their relationship
   to the organization and, more importantly, whether they support the project, are resis-
   tant to the project, or have no opinion.

Exam Essentials

Understand the Identify Stakeholders process.a* a* The purpose of this process is to iden
tify the project stakeholders, assess their influence and level of involvement, devise a
plan to deal with potential negative impacts, and record stakeholder information in the
stakeholder register.




Bringing the Processes Together
As a recap, the Initiating process group kicks off the project and results in the creation of
the project charter and the stakeholder register. This phase acknowledges that a new proj-
ect or phase should begin.
   But before a project formally exists, several scenarios may unfold:
1.        First, needs and demands surface within an organization, demonstrating the need for a
          project to be initiated.
2.        The potential project may then go through a feasibility study to determine whether the
          project and end result of the project are viable and whether there is an opportunity for
          success.
3.        A project may also go through a selection process. We looked at mathematical
          models and benefit measurement methods as two categories of project selection
          methods.
   After a project is selected, a project charter is created (using the Develop Project
Charter process) and signed, formally authorizing the project. By the end of the Develop
Project Charter process, the project charter contains several documented elements,
including the justification for the project, high-level requirements and description, sum-
mary milestone schedule and budget, and the sponsor and project manager (if already
selected).
   Once the project charter is generated, project stakeholders can be identified. This occurs
in the Identify Stakeholders process. You learned that stakeholders, along with their inter-
ests and levels of influence, are important to identify and define early on within the project.
As a result, a stakeholder register, which identifies, assesses, and classifies the individual
stakeholders, is created.
   Figure 2.15 shows the potential path of a new project, from its inception and through
the initiating phase.
   In this chapter, we also covered the 10 project management Knowledge Areas, which are
summarized in Table 2.11.

                              Planning is the second of five project management process
                              groups and includes the largest number of processes.
                              Throughout the planning processes, the objectives are defi ned
and refi ned, and a course of action is mapped out to successfully complete the project
objectives as outlined by the project scope.
   Several key project documents are created within this process group, including the proj-
ect management plan and its collection of subsidiary plans and baselines, which will guide
the project management activities.
   The Planning process group accounts for 24 percent of the questions on the Project
Management Professional (PMP(R)) exam.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and descrip-
                 tions of the project management process groups and related materials
                 and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide to the
                 Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide), Fifth Edition
                 (PMI(R), 2013).




Developing a Scope Management Plan
The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area is kicked off through a process that devel-
ops two key plans that will guide the identification of requirements, as well as the develop-
ment, validation, and management of the project's scope. These plans, referred to as the
scope management plan and requirements management plan, are subsidiary documents of
an overarching plan called the project management plan.


Understand Project Scope Management
The scope management plan is the culmination of the processes needed to guarantee that
the project includes all the work required to complete the project successfully. It also works
to make sure that the project focuses only on the work required to complete the project and
does not include unneeded tasks. As you learned in Chapter 2 , "Initiating the Project," the
Project Scope Management Knowledge Area consists of six processes, but only four of them
are a part of the Planning process group. The four processes used in the Planning process
group are Plan Scope Management, Collect Requirements, Defi ne Scope, and Create WBS.
80a*...        Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



   Plans not created out of a formal process are considered to be generated out of the
Develop Project Management Plan process, which is a high-level planning process that will
be covered later in this chapter.
   Figure 3.1 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Scope
Management process.

      * Meetings




Plan Scope Management
The scope management plan contains the following information or explanations:
aOE       The process used to prepare the project scope statement
aOE       A process for creating the work breakdown structure (WBS)
aOE       A definition of how the deliverables will be validated for accuracy and the process used
          for accepting deliverables
aOE       A description of the process for controlling scope change requests, including the proce-
          dure for requesting changes and how to obtain a change request form
   Keep in mind that throughout the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area, the
scope management plan serves as a guide for documenting and controlling the scope of the
project.

Inputs of Plan Scope Management
Know the following four inputs of the Plan Scope Management process:
Project Management Plana* a* To help inform what the project is intended to accomplish, the
project management plan with all of its approved subsidiary plans are used to help create
the scope management plan.
                                         Developing a Scope Management Plan                81




Project Charter As the project charter helps to communicate the high-level goals, business
needs, assumptions, and constraints, it is used in this process to align the scope manage-
ment plan with stakeholder expectations.
Enterprise Environmental Factors Several enterprise environmental factors can
influence the Plan Scope Management process, including but not limited to the
organization's culture, its infrastructure, marketplace conditions, and personnel
administration.
Organizational Process Assets Policies, procedures, and historical information, including
a lessons learned knowledge base, are a few of the organizational process assets that help
shape the scope management plan.


Tools and Techniques of Plan Scope Management
The two tools and techniques that the Plan Scope Management process uses are expert
judgement and meetings:
Expert Judgment Input that is received from experienced team members and those who
are knowledgeable about the project area provide what is considered to be expert judgment.
Be sure that you look to all corners of your organization for any person or group with spe-
cialized education or training, or who might possess knowledge, skills, and/or experience
in helping to develop the scope management plan.
Meetings In the course of developing the scope management plan, members of proj-
ect teams may attend meetings to help with information exchange and decision making.
Depending on the meeting, the following members might be a part of the discussion to
include: project manager, project sponsor, selected project team members, and anyone
having responsibility in this area.

Outputs of Plan Scope Management
For the exam, know the outputs of the Plan Scope Management process. This includes,
naturally, the scope management plan, as well as the requirements management plan.
   The components of this plan include processes for
    Preparing a detailed project scope statement
    Creating a WBS from the detailed project scope statement
    Establishing how the WBS will be maintained and approved
    Specifying how formal acceptance will be obtained for completed project
    deliverables
    Controlling and handling change requests to the detailed project scope statement


                 Remember that a scope management plan can be tailored to your needs,
                 meaning that it can be formal or informal and may be highly detailed or
                 broadly framed.
82        Chapter 3      Planning the Project




Requirements Management Plan
The requirements management plan defi nes how the requirements will be analyzed, docu-
mented, and managed throughout all phases of the project. The type of phase relationship
used to manage the project will determine how requirements are managed throughout the
project. A requirements management plan includes the following components:
     How planning, tracking, and reporting of requirements activities will occur
     How changes to the requirements will be requested, tracked, and analyzed along with
     other configuration management activities
     How requirements will be prioritized
     Which metrics will be used to trace product requirements
     Which requirements attributes will be documented in the traceability matrix
     The structure that will be used to help create the traceability matrix


Collect Requirements
During the early stages of planning, requirements will need to be collected, documented,
and assessed. This is carried out through the Collect Requirements process (one of the 47
project management processes). This tends to be an iterative process because requirements
often need to be refi ned as the project moves forward.


                  Requirements are typically conditions that must be met or criteria that
                  the product or service of the project must possess to satisfy the objec-
                  tives of the project. Requirements quantify and prioritize the wants, needs,
                  and expectations of the project sponsor and stakeholders. According to
                  the PMBOK(R) Guide, you must be able to measure, trace, and test require-
                  ments. It's important that they be complete and accepted by your project
                  sponsor and key stakeholders.


   As covered in Chapter 2 , high-level requirements are documented within the proj-
ect charter. Based on this document and lessons learned from past projects, detailed
requirements will need to be gathered and assessed with the stakeholders. This is
necessary to establishing the project deliverables. Detailed requirements can be gath-
ered through the use of several requirement-gathering techniques that will produce a
comprehensive list of requirements and that are needed to later establish the project
deliverables. Collect Requirements is the third process within the Planning process
group, following the creation of the scope management plan, and the second process in
the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area. The primary purpose of the Collect
Requirements process is to defi ne and document the project sponsors', customers',
and stakeholders' expectations and needs for meeting the project objectives. This can
                                                       Requirements Management Plan                  83




be done through the use of lessons learned from previous projects, information from
within the project charter and stakeholder register, and several requirement-gathering
techniques. By the end of this process, the project will include a plan that defi nes
how the requirements will be documented and managed throughout all phases of the
project.
   Figure 3.2 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Collect
Requirements process.

Inputs of Collect Requirements
Know the following inputs of the Collect Requirements process:
Scope Management Plan The scope management plan provides direction on how mem-
bers of the project pick the type of requirements needed to be collected for the project.
Requirements Management Plan The requirements management plan helps defi ne and
document the stakeholders' wants and needs.
84a*...        Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Stakeholder Management Plana* a* We will cover the stakeholder management plan in the
"Developing a Stakeholder Management Plan" section later in this chapter. For the collect
requirements process, the stakeholder management plan is used to document the stakeholder
communication requirements and their level of engagement. This will help the project team
adjust the requirements activities to the level of stakeholder participation that is needed.
Project Chartera* a* In this process, the high-level project requirements and product descrip-
tion are used from within the project charter.
Stakeholder Registera* a* In this process, the stakeholder register is used as a way of determin-
ing who can provide the necessary information on the project and product requirements.

Tools and Techniques of Collect Requirements
Know the following tools and techniques that can be used during the Collect Requirements
process:
aOE       Interviews
aOE       Focus groups
aOE       Facilitated workshops
aOE       Group creativity techniques
aOE       Group decision-making techniques
aOE       Questionnaires and surveys
aOE       Observations
aOE       Prototypes
aOE       Benchmarking
aOE       Context diagrams
aOE       Document analysis
Interviewsa* a* Interviews allow subject matter experts and experienced project participants
to impart a lot of information in a short amount of time. The following are characteristics
of interviews:
aOE       Typically structured as a one-on-one conversation with stakeholders
aOE       Can be formal or informal
aOE       Consist of questions prepared ahead of time
Focus Groupsa* a* Focus groups are usually conducted by a trained moderator. The key to
this tool lies in picking the subject matter experts and stakeholders to participate in the
focus group; they then engage in discussion and conversation as a way of imparting their
feedback about the project's end result.
Facilitated Workshopsa* a* Cross-functional stakeholders come together in a facilitated
workshop to discuss and define requirements that affect more than one department. The
following are characteristics of facilitated workshops:
aOE       All the participants of the workshops understand the various project needs.
                                                 Requirements Management Plan                 85



    The workshops provide a facilitated forum to discuss and resolve their participants' issues.
    A consensus is reached more easily than through other methods.



                 The primary difference between focus groups and facilitated workshops is
                 that focus groups are gatherings of prequalified subject matter experts and
                 stakeholders where the intention is to gather feedback from these individu-
                 als, and facilitated workshops consist of cross-functional stakeholders who
                 work together to define cross-functional requirements.


Group Creativity Techniques     Group creativity involves the following techniques:
   Brainstorming Brainstorming involves getting together to generate ideas and gather the
   project requirements.
   Nominal Group Technique Nominal group technique works to engage all partici-
   pants through an idea-gathering or structured brainstorming session and ranking
   process.
   Idea/Mind Mapping In idea/mind mapping, participants use a combination of brain-
   storming and diagramming techniques to record their ideas.
   Affinity Diagrams    Affi nity diagrams sort ideas into related groups for further analysis
   and review.
   Multicriteria Decision Analysis With multicriteria decision analysis, a decision matrix
   is used for establishing criteria for a systematic analytical approach.

Group Decision-Making Techniques According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, several group
decision-making techniques are used. The four methods mentioned are as follows:
    Unanimity, where everyone agrees on the resolution or course of action
    Majority, where more than 50 percent of the members support the resolution
    Plurality, where the largest subgroup within the group makes the decision if a majority
    is not reached
    Dictatorship, where one person makes the decision on behalf of the group
Questionnaires and Surveys Questionnaires and surveys involve querying a large group of
participants via questionnaires or surveys and applying statistical analysis, if needed, to the
results. This is considered to be a quick way of obtaining feedback from a large number of
stakeholders.
Observations Observations consist of a one-on-one experience where an observer sits
side by side with the participant to observe how the participant interacts with the product
or service. This technique is also known as job shadowing; it can also involve participant
observers who perform the job themselves to ascertain requirements, or the observation of a
group of participants performing a job function. Observations are particularly useful when
stakeholders have a difficult time verbalizing requirements.
86a*...        Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Prototypesa* a* Prototyping is a technique involving constructing a working model or mock-up of
the final product for participants to experiment with. The prototype does not usually contain
all the functionality the end product does, but it gives participants enough information that
they can provide feedback regarding the mock-up. This is an iterative process where partici-
pants experiment and provide feedback, the prototype is revised, and the cycle starts again.
Prototypes are a great way of getting feedback during the early stages of a project's life cycle.
Benchmarkinga* a* Ever like to see how you measure up against other organizations or
internal projects? With benchmarking there is a comparison of actual or planned practices
against comparable organizations to measure performance, to glean new ideas to be used to
improve your organization, and to identify best practices.
Context Diagramsa* a* Use of context diagrams helps to visually represent the product scope
by mapping a business system with the people and other systems that interact with that
business system. This is done by displaying the business system inputs and user roles, and
then depicting the inputs, outputs, and user roles for those who receive the output.
Document Analysisa* a* Another technique used in the identification of requirements is docu-
ments analysis, where existing documentation is reviewed to see if there is relevant infor-
mation to complete the requirements. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a great variety of
documents could be scrutinized, including but not limited to the following:
aOE       Business plans
aOE       Marketing materials

Outputs of Collect Requirements
For the exam, know the outputs of the Collect Requirements process, which are as follows:
Requirements Documentationa* a* This output involves recording the requirements in a
requirements document. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this document includes at least
the following elements:
aOE       Business need for the project and why it was undertaken
aOE       Objectives of the project and the business objectives the project hopes to fulfill
aOE       Stakeholder requirements, including impacts to other organizational areas
aOE       Functional requirements
aOE       Nonfunctional requirements
                                                   Requirements Management Plan                87



      Quality requirements
      Acceptance criteria
      Business rules
      Organizational areas and outside entities impacted
      Support and training requirements
      Assumptions and constraints
      Signatures of the key stakeholders
Requirements Traceability Matrix The traceability matrix links requirements to business
needs and project objectives and also documents the following:
      Where the requirement originated
      What the requirement will be traced to
      Status updates all the way through delivery or completion


                   According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the requirements traceability matrix
                   helps assure that business value is realized when the project is complete
                   because each requirement is linked to a business and project objective.

Table 3.1 shows a sample traceability matrix with several attributes that identify the
requirement.

Ta b l e 3 .1     Requirements traceability matrix

                            stakeholder


Here are the characteristics of a traceability matrix:
      Each requirement should have its own unique identifier.
      A brief description includes enough information to easily identify the requirement.
      The source column refers to where the requirement originated.
      Priority refers to the priority of the requirement.
      The test scenario records how the requirement will be tested or during which project
      phase, and test verification indicates if it passes or fails the test.
      Status may capture information about the requirement that refers to whether the
      requirement has been approved to be included in the project. Examples include added,
      deferred, and canceled.

Exam Essentials

Understand the purpose of collecting requirements.a* a* Requirements are collected to
define and document the project sponsors', customers', and stakeholders' expectations
and needs for meeting the project objective.



   After requirements have been gathered, the next step is to begin breaking down and
documenting the project and product's scope. The end result will be a WBS, which is a
deliverable-oriented, high-level decomposition of the project work. But before the WBS can
be generated, a few additional steps must be addressed:
aOE       The creation and sign-off of the project scope statement
aOE       The creation of a scope baseline
   The project scope statement is an output of the Define Scope process and is where the
project deliverables are documented along with the constraints and assumptions of the proj-
ect. Once the project scope statement, WBS, and another output called the WBS dictionary
are created, they become part of a scope baseline.


Define Scope
The result and main objective of the Define Scope process is the creation of the project scope
statement. The project scope statement is used to develop and document a detailed description
of the deliverables of the project and the work needed to produce them. This process addresses
the project objectives, requirements, constraints, assumptions, and other elements of writing the
project scope statement and is progressively elaborated as more detail becomes known.
   Figure 3.3 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Define Scope process.

                   For more detailed information on the Define Scope process, see Chapter 3 of
                   PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.



Inputs of Define Scope
The Defi ne Scope process has four inputs you should know:
Scope Management Plan       The scope management plan outlines how this process is to be
carried out.
Project Charter From within the project charter, this process primarily utilizes the proj-
ect objectives. Objectives are quantifiable criteria used to measure project success. They
describe what the project is trying to do, accomplish, or produce. Quantifiable criteria
should at least include the following items:
    Schedule
    Cost
    Quality measures
    Business measures or quality targets (sometimes)
Requirements Documentation The requirements documentation includes elements such as
functional and nonfunctional characteristics, quality metrics, and acceptance criteria. For a
more detailed description, see "Outputs of Collect Requirements" earlier in this chapter.
Organizational Process Assets This process uses historical information from within the
organizational process assets as well as policies, procedures, and project scope statement
templates.

Tools and Techniques of Define Scope
Know the following tools and techniques that you will use during the Defi ne Scope process:
Expert Judgment According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following items are examples of
expert judgment used in this process:
    Subject matter experts or consultants
    Stakeholders
    Industry groups and associations
    Other departments or units internal to the organization
Product Analysis Product analysis is a method for converting the product description and
project objectives into deliverables and requirements. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
product analysis might include performing the following to further defi ne the product or
service:
    Value analysis
    Functional analysis
90         Chapter 3        Planning the Project



      Requirements analysis
      Systems-engineering techniques
      Systems analysis
      Product breakdown
      Value-engineering techniques
Alternatives Generation Alternatives generation is a technique used for discovering dif-
ferent methods or ways of accomplishing the work of the project. Examples of alternatives
generation are brainstorming and lateral thinking.
Lateral thinking is a process of separating problems, looking at them from angles other
than their obvious presentation, and encouraging team members to come up with ways to
solve problems that are not apparently obvious or look at scope in a different way. This can
also be described as out-of-the-box thinking.
Facilitated Workshops Facilitated workshops involve stakeholders coming together to dis-
cuss and defi ne requirements that affect more than one department.

Outputs of Define Scope
Know the following outputs of the Defi ne Scope process:
Project Scope Statement The purpose of the project scope statement is to document the
project objectives, deliverables, and the work required to produce the deliverables so that
it can be used to direct the project team's work and as a basis for future project decisions.
The project scope statement is an agreement between the project organization and the
customer that states precisely what the work of the project will produce.


                   The project scope statement guides the work of the project team during
                   the Executing process, and all change requests will be evaluated against
                   the scope statement. The criteria outlined will also be used to determine
                   whether the project was completed successfully.

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project scope statement should include all of the
following:
      Product scope description
      Product acceptance criteria
      Project deliverables
      Project exclusions
      Project constraints
      Project assumptions
     Product Scope Description The product scope description describes the characteristics
     of the product, service, or result of the project.
                                                  Requirements Management Plana*...            91




  Product Acceptance Criteriaa* a* Product acceptance criteria include the process and crite-
  ria that will be used to determine whether the deliverables and the final product, service,
  or result of the project is acceptable and satisfactory.
  Project Deliverablesa* a* Deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific
  items that must be produced to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables
  should be specific, unique, and verifiable and may include supplementary outcomes.


Deliverables vs. Requirements

Deliverables describe the components of the goals and objectives in a quantifiable way.
Requirements are the specifications of the deliverables. Select deliverables and require-
ments are sometimes referred to as critical success factors. Critical success factors are
those elements that must be completed for the project to be considered complete.


  Project Exclusionsa* a* Project exclusions are anything that isn't included as a deliverable or
  work of the project. Project exclusions should be noted in the project scope statement for
  stakeholder management purposes.
  Project Constraintsa* a* Anything that either restricts the actions of the project team or
  dictates the actions of the project team or the way the project should be performed is
  considered a constraint. The project manager must balance the project constraints while
  meeting or exceeding the expectations of the stakeholders.
  Examples of project constraints include, but are not limited to, the following items:
   aOE   Scope
   aOE   Quality
   aOE   Schedule
   aOE   Budget
   aOE   Resources
   aOE   Risk
  Project Assumptionsa* a* Assumptions are things considered true, real, or certain, for
  planning purposes. Each project will have its own set of assumptions, and the assump-
  tions should be identified, documented, validated, and updated throughout the project.
  Defining new assumptions and refining old ones are forms of progressive elaboration.
  The following list includes examples of assumptions:
   aOE   Vendor delivery times
   aOE   Product availability
   aOE   Contractor availability
   aOE   Accuracy of the project plan
   aOE   Belief that key project members will perform adequately
92            Chapter 3        Planning the Project



           Contract signing dates
           Project start dates
           Project phase start dates
Project Documents Updates Project documents encompass those documents from within
the project that are not plans or baselines. There may be several common updates and
changes to project documents resulting from this process:
        Original project objectives
        Stakeholder register
        Requirements documentation
        Requirements traceability matrix
        The scope statement as a result of approved changes


                       In practice, the Define Scope process is performed before the Collect
                       Requirements process. Deliverables must be identified before their
                       detailed requirements are documented.



Create WBS
The Create WBS process takes the well-defined deliverables and requirements and begins the pro-
cess of breaking down the work via a WBS. WBS stands for work breakdown structure, which
defines the scope of the project and breaks down the deliverables into smaller, more manageable
components of work that can be scheduled and estimated as well as easily assigned, monitored,
and controlled. The WBS should detail the full scope of work needed to complete the project.
   Figure 3.4 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Create WBS process.

Inputs of Create WBS
For the exam, know the following inputs of the Create WBS process:
Scope Management Plan The scope management plan is a planning tool that documents
how the project team will defi ne project scope, how changes to scope will be maintained
and controlled, and how scope will be verified.
Project Scope Statement The project scope statement contains information valuable to
creating the WBS, most notably the list of project deliverables.
Requirements Documentation The requirements documentation describes how the
requirements meet the business needs of the project.
Enterprise Environmental Factors In addition to enterprise environmental factors that
have already been discussed, there may be industry-specific WBS standards that are rel-
evant to the type of project that you are undertaking. If so, that information may serve as
an additional reference to the creation of the WBS.
Organizational Process Assets This process uses historical information from within the
organizational process assets as well as policies, procedures, and WBS templates.


                  For more detailed information on the Create WBS process, see Chapter 3 of
                  PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.



Tools and Techniques of Create WBS
The Create WBS process has two tools and techniques: decomposition and expert judgment.
Decomposition Decomposition involves breaking down the project deliverables into
smaller, more manageable components of work that can be easily planned, executed, moni-
tored and controlled, and closed out.
The project manager typically decomposes the work with the help of the project team,
whose members have expert knowledge of the work. Benefits of team involvement include a
more realistic decomposition of the work and getting team buy-in.
Decomposition provides a way of managing the scope of the project and also does the
following:
     Improves estimates
     More easily assigns performance measures and controls
     Provides a baseline to compare against throughout the project or phase
     Ensures that assignments go to the proper parties
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, decomposition consists of the following five-step
process:
1.   Identify the deliverables and work.
2.   Organize the WBS.
94a*...        Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



3.        Decompose the WBS components into lower-level components.
4.        Assign identification codes.
5.        Verify the WBS.
Expert Judgmenta* a* For creating the WBS, expert judgment is routinely used to start break-
ing down project deliverables by analyzing the information available. Don't forget that
expert judgment can also come in the form of predefined templates, which provide instruc-
tions on how to effectively break down common deliverables. Templates can come from
the industry you are working in, or created by your organization as a result of experience
gained from performing similar projects.


Outputs of Create WBS
The Create WBS process has two outputs:
aOE       Scope baseline
aOE       Project documents updates
Scope Baselinea* a* The scope baseline for the project is the approved project scope
statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. These documents together describe in
detail all the work of the project. The documents allow managers to carry out the
following activities:
aOE       Document schedules
aOE       Assign resources
aOE       Monitor and control the project work
          Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)a* a* The following are various ways of organizing the
          WBS:
             Major Deliverablesa* a* The major deliverables of the project are used as the first level
             of decomposition in this structure.
             Subprojectsa* a* Another way to organize the work is by subprojects. Each of the
             subproject managers will develop a WBS for their subproject that details the work
             required for that deliverable.
             Project Phasesa* a* Many projects are structured or organized by project phases. Each
             phase listed here would be the first level of decomposition, and its deliverables
             would be the next level.
          The following is a general description of the various levels within the WBS:
             Level 1a* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, Level 1 of the WBS is the project level.
             The first level of decomposition, however, may be the second level of the WBS,
             which could include deliverables, phases, and subprojects--see Figure 3.5 for an
             example.

           Lowest Level The lowest level of any WBS is called the work package level. The
           goal is to construct the WBS to the work package level where cost estimates and
           schedule dates can be estimated reliably and easily.


                        Work packages are the components that can be easily assigned to one
                        person, or a team of people, with clear accountability and responsibility
                        for completing the assignment. The work package level will later be
                        decomposed further into lists of activities.

       Collectively, all the levels of the WBS roll up to the top so that all the work of the project
       is captured. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this is known as the 100 percent rule.


                        For more information on WBS, and for industry-specific examples of WBS
                        templates, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures,
                        Second Edition (PMI(R), 2006).


       Here are the other elements of the WBS that you should know:
           WBS Templates Work breakdown structures can be constructed using WBS tem-
           plates or the WBS from a similar completed project. Although every project is unique,
           many companies and industries perform the same kind of projects repeatedly.
           Rolling Wave Planning Rolling wave planning is a process of elaborating deliver-
           ables, project phases, or subprojects in the WBS to differing levels of decomposition
           depending on the expected date of the work.
           Unique WBS Identifiers Each element at each level of the WBS is generally
           assigned a unique identifier according to the PMBOK(R) Guide. Figure 3.8 shows
           what a WBS with unique identifiers displayed might look like.

         WBS Dictionarya* a* The WBS dictionary is where work component descriptions are
         documented. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the WBS dictionary should include
         the following elements for each component of the WBS:
         aOE   Code of accounts identifier
         aOE   Description of the work of the component
         aOE   Organization responsible for completing the component
         aOE   List of schedule milestones
         aOE   Schedule activities associated with the schedule milestones
         aOE   Required resources
         aOE   Cost estimates
         aOE   Quality requirements
         aOE   Criteria for acceptance
         aOE   Technical references
         aOE   Contract information
Project Documents Updatesa* a* The following documents may need to be updated as a result
of this process:
aOE   Project scope statement
aOE   Requirements documentation
aOE   Any other project documents that should reflect approved changes to the project scope
      statement


Exam Essentials

Understand the purpose of the project scope statement.a* a* The project scope statement
serves as a common understanding of project scope among the stakeholders. The project
objectives and deliverables and their quantifiable criteria are documented in the project
scope statement and are used by the project manager and the stakeholders to determine
whether the project was completed successfully. It also serves as a basis for future proj-
ect decisions.

Be able to define project constraints and assumptions.a* a* Project constraints limit the
options of the project team and restrict their actions. Sometimes, constraints dictate
actions. Common constraints include scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, and
risk. Assumptions are conditions that, for planning purposes, are presumed to be true,
real, or certain.

Be able to describe the purpose of the scope management plan.a* a* The scope management
plan has a direct influence on the project's success and describes the process for deter-
mining project scope, facilitates creating the WBS, describes how the product or service
of the project is verified and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be han-
dled. The scope management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.
98        Chapter 3      Planning the Project




Be able to define a WBS and its components. The WBS is a deliverable-oriented
hierarchy. It uses the deliverables from the project scope statement or similar docu-
ments and decomposes them into logical, manageable units of work. The lowest level
of any WBS is called a work package.




                  Don't forget that the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area has
                  two more processes: Validate Scope and Control Scope. Look for a dis-
                  cussion of these processes in Chapter 5, "Monitoring and Controlling
                  the Project."




Developing a Project Schedule
Like the Project Scope and Project Cost Management Knowledge Areas, the Project
Time Management Knowledge Area also has a plan that guides the processes within it:
the schedule management plan. A good tip to remember is that there is a pattern to the
logic regarding a standard and consistent methodology in each of the Knowledge Areas
described in this chapter, namely that each Knowledge Area leads with a process to
develop the plan for that area of management. In this chapter, that process is called Plan
Schedule Management.
   Developing a schedule consists of six steps, each carried out through a formal planning
process:
     Plan Schedule Management, which is similar to processes in other Knowledge Areas,
     sets the policies, procedures, and documentation used in the planning, creation, man-
     aging, executing, and controlling of the project schedule.
     Define Activities, which breaks down the work packages of the WBS into detailed
     work (activities) to be carried out by project team members.
     Sequence Activities, which places the activities into a logical order based on existing
     dependencies.
     Estimate Activity Resources, which estimates the type and quantity of resources
     needed to carry out each activity.
     Estimate Activity Durations, which estimates how long each activity will take.
     Develop Schedule, which produces an accepted and signed-off project schedule.
   Through the use of the planning processes noted, the project management team builds
a schedule that is based on the project's timeline, scope, and resource plan to arrive at
                                                        Developing a Project Schedulea*...          99




the timely completion of the project. The accepted and signed-off version of the project
schedule becomes the schedule baseline.
   Figure 3.9 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Schedule
Management process.

Understand Plan Schedule Management
The schedule management plan should be created early within the planning stages of a
project. The plan is responsible for guiding the creation, management, and control of the
project schedule.

Inputs of Plan Schedule Management
Similar to the Plan Scope Management process, you will need to know the following four
inputs of the Plan Schedule Management process:
Project Management Plana* a* To help inform what the project is intended to accomplish, the
project management plan with all of its approved subsidiary plans is used to help create the
schedule management plan. Specifically, the scope baseline and other information about
risk, cost, and communication decisions are used to help create the schedule.
Project Chartera* a* In regard to this process, the project charter is used to define the sum-
mary milestone schedule and the requirements to obtain project approval as it relates to
managing the project schedule.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Several enterprise environmental factors can influence the
Plan Schedule Management process, including but not limited to the organization's culture, its
infrastructure, project management software that provides the scheduling tool and schedule
alternative generation, published commercial information, and organizational work systems.
100a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Quite a few process assets influence the Plan Schedule
Management process, including but not limited to these:
aOE    The use of monitoring and reporting tools
aOE    Schedule control tools
aOE    Historical information
aOE    Policies, procedures, and guidelines related to formal and informal schedule control
aOE    Templates
aOE    Project closure guidelines
aOE    Change control procedures
aOE    Risk control procedures

Tools and Techniques of Plan Schedule Management
The three tools and techniques that the Plan Schedule Management process uses are expert
judgment, analytical techniques, and meetings:
Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment brings invaluable perspective about prior similar proj-
ects attempted, as well as the existing environment that will affect the project. This can
also be useful in considering how to combine methods of schedule planning and how to
best resolve differences between those methods.
Analytical Techniquesa* a* Most management involves picking between different options, and
it is no different for this process. Plan schedule management may ask you to pick between
strategic options to estimate and schedule the project like the scheduling methodology,
which scheduling tools and techniques to use, estimating approaches, formats, and project
management software. As the project develops, the schedule management plan may require
analysis to determine options that fast track or crash the project schedule. Remember, that
these options may introduce risk to the project, so don't forget to update the risk register.
Meetingsa* a* In the course of developing the schedule management plan, members of project
teams may attend schedule development meetings. Depending on the meeting, the following
members might include the project manager, project sponsor, selected project team mem-
bers, and anyone having responsibility in this area.

Outputs of Plan Schedule Management
The primary output of the Plan Schedule Management process is the schedule management plan.
  The components of this plan establish the following:
aOE    Project schedule model development, which specifies the methodology and tools to
       be used
aOE    Level of accuracy, which sets the tolerances used to determine realistic activity dura-
       tion estimates and the amount needed for contingencies
aOE    Units of measure, which could be vital depending on the industry the project is in and
       whether the project involves multiple countries
                                                           Developing a Project Schedule               101



    Organizational procedure links, as provided by the framework of the WBS
    Project schedule model maintenance, or a model for updating status and progress of
    the project
    Control thresholds, which establish the variance thresholds for monitoring schedule
    performance and define the amount of variation the project can sustain before some
    action must be performed
    Rules of performance measurement, where physical measurement, rules of performance
    measurement, or earned value measurement rules are set
    Reporting formats and frequency of reports
    Process descriptions for each of the schedule management processes


                     Remember that a schedule management plan can be tailored to your
                     needs, meaning that it can be formal or informal and might be highly
                     detailed or broadly framed.


Define Activities
The purpose of the Define Activities process is to decompose the work packages into schedule
activities where the basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring and controlling
the work of the project is easily supported and accomplished. This process documents the spe-
cific activities needed to fulfill the deliverables detailed in the WBS. By the end of this process,
the project team will have defined a list of activities, their characteristics, and a milestones list.
    Figure 3.10 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Defi ne Activities
process.

                  Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.



Inputs of Define Activities
You should know the following inputs of the Defi ne Activities process:
Schedule Management Plan The critical input from this plan is the defi ned level of detail
needed to manage the work.
Scope Baseline    The scope baseline takes into account the following:
      Work packages, from within the WBS
      Constraints and assumptions, from within the project scope statement
Enterprise Environmental Factors Enterprise environmental factors include the project
management information system; the organizational culture and structure; and published,
commercially available information.
Organizational Process Assets The organizational process assets provide existing guide-
lines and policies, historical project documents (such as partial activity lists from previous
projects), and a lessons-learned knowledge base, all of which are used for defi ning the
project activities.

Tools and Techniques of Define Activities
You can use the following three tools and techniques in the Defi ne Activities process:
Decomposition Decomposition in this process involves breaking the work packages into
smaller, more manageable units of work called activities. Activities are individual units of
work that must be completed to fulfi ll the deliverables listed in the WBS.
Rolling Wave Planning Rolling wave planning is a form of progressive elaboration that
involves planning near-term work in more detail than future-term work. As the work pro-
gresses, the work that was once considered future-term is then broken out into more granu-
lar detail.
Expert Judgment Expert judgment helps defi ne activities and involves project team mem-
bers with prior experience developing project scope statements and WBSs.

Outputs of Define Activities
The following are outputs of the Defi ne Activities process:
Activity List Activity lists contain all the schedule activities that will be performed for
the project, with a scope-of-work description of each activity and an identifier so that team
members understand what the work is and how it is to be completed.
                                                   Developing a Project Schedule              103




                  The schedule activities are individual elements of the project schedule.



Activity Attributes Activity attributes describe the characteristics of the activities and are
an extension of the activity list. Activity attributes will change over the life of the project,
as more information is known.
During the early stages of the project, activity attributes typically consist of the
following:
    Activity ID
    WBS identification code it's associated with
    Activity name
As the project progresses, the following activity attributes may be added:
    Predecessor and successor activities
    Logical relationships
    Leads and lags
    Resource requirements
    Constraints and assumptions associated with the activity
Milestone List Milestones are major accomplishments of the project and mark the
completion of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. The milestone list
documents several things:
    Records the accomplishments
    Documents whether a milestone is mandatory or optional
    Becomes part of the project management plan
    Helps develop the project schedule


                  In practice, the Define Activities process and Sequence Activities process
                  may be combined into one process or step.




Sequence Activities
The Sequence Activities process takes the identified schedule activities from the Defi ne
Activities process, sequences them in logical order, and identifies any dependencies that
exist among the activities. The interactivity of logical relationships must be sequenced cor-
rectly in order to facilitate the development of a realistic, achievable project schedule. The
end of this process results in the creation of project schedule network diagrams, which visu-
ally show the sequence of activities and their dependencies.

Inputs of Sequence Activities
Within the Sequence Activities process, you will use the following inputs:
          Schedule management plan
          Activity list
          Activity attributes
          Milestone list
          Project scope statement
          Enterprise environmental factors
          Organizational process assets
Schedule Management Plan The schedule management plan clarifies the tools and
methods to be used in scheduling, which informs how activities may be sequenced.
Activity List To sequence activities, you would fi rst need to acquire the activity list as an
input. The activity list includes the activities along with their identifiers and a description of
the work's scope.
                                                   Developing a Project Schedulea*...        105




Activity Attributesa* a* Activity attributes may reveal information on the sequencing of activi-
ties, such as through predecessor or successor relationships.
Milestone Lista* a* Milestone lists may contain milestones with scheduled dates. These dates
might impact the sequencing of activities.
Project Scope Statementa* a* The product scope description in the project scope statement
includes product details that may be used for sequencing activities.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Sequence activities may be influenced by enterprise
environmental factors such as government or industry standards, the project management
information system, schedule tool, and any company work authorization systems.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The project files found within the corporate knowledge
base are used from within the organizational process assets for scheduling purposes.


Tools and Techniques of Sequence Activities
You will need to be familiar with the following tools and techniques of the Sequence
Activities process:
aOE   Precedence diagramming method (PDM)
aOE   Dependency determination
aOE   Leads and lags
Precedence Diagramming Methoda* a* The precedence diagramming method (PDM) uses
boxes or rectangles to represent the activities (called nodes). The nodes are connected with
arrows showing the dependencies between the activities. This method is also called activity
on node (AON). PDM uses only one-time estimates to determine duration.
The following information is displayed on a node:
aOE   Activity name (required)
aOE   Activity number (optional)
aOE   Start and stop dates (optional)
aOE   Due dates (optional)
aOE   Slack time (optional)
aOE   Any additional or relevant information (optional)
The following illustration shows a general example of a PDM, or AON.



                   Start           A          B             D          Finish

106a*...    Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



The PDM is further defined by the following four types of dependencies, also known as
logical relationships:
    Finish-to-Starta* a* The finish-to-start (FS) relationship is the most frequently used relation-
    ship. In this relationship, the predecessor activity must finish before the successor activity
    can start.
    Start-to-Finisha* a* In the start-to-finish (SF) relationship, the predecessor activity must
    start before the successor activity can finish. This logical relationship is seldom used.
    Finish-to-Finisha* a* In the finish-to-finish (FF) relationship, the predecessor activity must
    finish before the successor activity finishes.
    Start-to-Starta* a* In the start-to-start (SS) relationship, the predecessor activity must start
    before the successive activity can start.

Memorize a diagram of the precedence diagramming methods like activity-on-node
(AON) to add to your scratch paper at the start of the exam.



Dependency Determinationa* a* Dependencies are relationships between the activities in
which one activity is dependent on another to complete an action, or perhaps an activity is
dependent on another to start an action before it can proceed. Dependency determination is
a matter of determining where those dependencies exist.
The following are four types of dependencies, defined by characteristics:
    Mandatory Dependenciesa* a* Mandatory dependencies, also known as hard logic or hard
    dependencies, are defined by the type of work being performed. The nature of the work
    itself dictates the order in which the activities should be performed.
    Discretionary Dependenciesa* a* Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project
    team. Discretionary dependencies are also known as preferred logic, soft logic, or pref-
    erential logic. These are usually process- or procedure-driven or best-practice techniques
    based on past experience.
    External Dependenciesa* a* External dependencies are external to the project. The
    PMBOK(R) Guide points out that even though the dependency is external to the project
    (and therefore a non-project activity), it impacts project activities.
    Internal Dependenciesa* a* Internal dependencies are internal to the project. These depen-
    dencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities that are within the
    project team's ability to control.
Arrow Diagramming Methoda* a* The arrow diagramming method (ADM) technique isn't
used nearly as often as PDM. ADM is visually the opposite of the PDM. The arrow dia-
gramming method places activities on the arrows, which are connected to dependent
                                                               Developing a Project Schedulea*...   107




activities with nodes. This method is also called activity on arrow (AOA). Characteristics of
the ADM technique are as follows:
aOE    ADM allows for more than one-time estimates to determine duration and uses only the
       finish-to-start dependency.
aOE    Dummy activities may be plugged into the diagram to accurately display the
       dependencies.
      The following illustration shows a general example of the ADM method.

                      Start         A                    B              D       Finish


                                                     C                      E




  The following illustration is meant to help you remember the difference between PDM
and ADM for the exam.


                                        PDM = AON = 1 Time Estimate


                                          Activity            On Node



                                        ADM = AOA => 1 Time Estimate

                                           Activity          On Arrow




Leads and Lagsa* a* Consider applying leads and lags when determining dependencies:
      Leadsa* a* Leads speed up the successor activities and require time to be subtracted from
      the start date or the finish date of the activity you're scheduling.
      Lagsa* a* Lags delay successor activities (those that follow a predecessor activity) and
      require time added either to the start date or to the finish date of the activity being
      scheduled.

Outputs of Sequence Activities
There are two outputs of the Sequence Activities process that you should be familiar with:
Project Schedule Network Diagramsa* a* Like the WBS, the project schedule network
diagrams might contain all the project details or contain only summary-level details,
depending on the complexity of the project. Summary-level activities are a collection of
108          Chapter 3        Planning the Project



related activities also known as hammocks. Hammocks are a group of related activities
rolled up into a summary heading that describes the activities likely to be contained in
that grouping.
Project Documents Updates            The following project documents may require updates as a
result of this process:
      Activity lists
      Activity attributes
      Milestone list
      Risk register (for an introduction to the risk register, see "Outputs of Identify Risks"
      later in this chapter)
   Figure 3.12 shows the position of the Sequence Activities process in relation to the other
time management processes.

Estimate Activity Resources
After the activities are sequenced, the next steps involve estimating the resources and esti-
mating the durations of the activities so that they can be plugged into the project schedule.
The Estimate Activity Resources process is concerned with determining the types and
quantities of resources (both human and materials) needed for each schedule activity within
a work package.


                       The term resource refers to all the physical resources required to complete
                       the project. The PMBOK (R) Guide defines resources as people, equipment,
                       and materials.


  Figure 3.13 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Estimate Activity
Resources process.

Inputs of Estimate Activity Resources
You should know the following inputs for the Estimate Activity Resources process:
    Schedule management plan
    Activity list
    Activity attributes
    Resource calendars
    Risk register
    Activity cost estimates
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
Schedule Management Plan To help assist in determining the resources to be
estimated, the schedule management plan identifi es the level of accuracy and the units
of measure.
110            Chapter 3      Planning the Project



Activity List     The activity list is necessary to know which activities will need resources.
Activity Attributes The activity attributes provide the details necessary to come up with
an estimate of the resources needed per activity.
Resource Calendars Resource calendars describe the time frames in which resources are
available and include the following:
      Skills
      Abilities
      Quantity
      Availability
Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equipment and
material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule.



                     Resource calendars are an output of the Acquire Project Team and Conduct
                     Procurements processes. Both of these processes are performed dur-
                     ing the Executing process group. For additional information on these
                     processes, see Chapter 4.


Risk Register The risk register helps inform how risk events can disrupt resource selection
and availability.
Activity Cost Estimates The activity cost estimates are necessary to know how cost may
impact resource selection.
Enterprise Environmental Factors Information on the resource availability and skills can
be obtained through enterprise environmental factors.
Organizational Process Assets Information from previous similar projects, and poli-
cies and procedures relating to staffi ng and equipment purchase and rental, are used from
within the organizational process assets.


Tools and Techniques of Estimate Activity Resources
The tools and techniques within the Estimate Activity Resources process include the
following:
      Expert judgment
      Alternatives analysis
      Published estimating data
      Bottom-up estimating
      Project management software
                                                  Developing a Project Schedule             111




Expert Judgment Individuals with experience and knowledge of resource planning and
estimating can be tapped for information and guidance used within this process.
Alternatives Analysis Alternatives analysis helps to make decisions about the possible
resource types (such as expert or novice) and methods that are available to accomplish the
activities. Make-or-buy analysis can also be used for decisions regarding resources.
Published Estimating Data Estimating data might include organizational guidelines,
industry rates or estimates, production rates, and so on.
Bottom-Up Estimating Bottom-up estimating is used when an activity cannot be
confidently estimated. With the help of experts, the activity is broken down into smaller
components of work for estimating purposes and then rolled back up to the original
activity level. This is an accurate means of estimating, but it can be time-consuming
and costly.
Project Management Software      Within this process, project management software can
help in the following ways:
    Plan, organize, and estimate resource needs
    Document resource availability
    Create resource breakdown structures
    Create resource rates
    Create resource calendars


Outputs of Estimate Activity Resources
Three outputs result from carrying out the Estimate Activity Resources process:
Activity Resource Requirements Activity resource requirements describe the types of
resources and the quantity needed for each activity associated with a work package. The
description should include the following:
    How estimates were determined
    Information used to form the estimate
    Assumptions made about the resources and their availability



                 Work package estimates are derived by taking a cumulative total of all the
                 schedule activities within that particular work package.


Resource Breakdown Structure The resource breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical
structure that lists resources by category and type. Figure 3.14 illustrates a basic example of
what an RBS may look like.

aOE    Activity attributes
aOE    Resource calendars


Estimate Activity Durations
The Estimate Activity Durations process attempts to estimate the work effort, resources,
and number of work periods needed to complete each activity. These are quantifiable esti-
mates expressed as the number of work periods needed to complete a schedule activity.
Estimates are progressively elaborated, typically starting at a fairly high level, and as more
                                                           Developing a Project Schedule                  113




and more details are known about the deliverables and their associated activities, the esti-
mates become more accurate.

Inputs of Estimate Activity Durations
You should be familiar with several inputs of the Estimate Activity Durations process:
       Schedule management plan
       Activity list
       Activity attributes
       Activity resource requirements
       Resource calendars
       Project scope statement
       Risk register
114a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



aOE    Resource breakdown structure
aOE    Enterprise environmental factors
aOE    Organizational process assets
Schedule Management Plana* a* The schedule management plan sets the approach used and
the level of accuracy required to estimate activity durations including the project update
cycle.
Activity Lista* a* The list of activities is necessary to estimate the activity durations.
Activity Attributesa* a* Information included within the activity attributes will influence the
activity duration estimates.
Activity Resource Requirementsa* a* The availability of the assigned resources will impact the
duration of the activities.
Resource Calendarsa* a* Information from the resource calendars that influences this process
is as follows:
aOE    Type, availability, and capability of human resources
aOE    Type, availability, capability, and quantity of equipment and material resources
Project Scope Statementa* a* Constraints and assumptions are considered when estimating
activity durations.
Risk Registera* a* The list of risks is necessary, along with the results of risk analysis and risk
response planning.
Resource Breakdown Structurea* a* The resource breakdown structure provides a hierarchical
view of the identified resources. This then provides key information that will help estimate
activity durations.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Enterprise environmental factors used include the fol-
lowing items:
aOE    Internal reference data for estimating durations
aOE    External reference data available commercially
aOE    Defined productivity metrics
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The following organizational process assets are used:
aOE    Historical information from previous similar projects, including duration information,
       project calendars, and lessons learned
aOE    Scheduling methodology

Tools and Techniques of Estimate Activity Durations
The six tools and techniques of the Estimate Activity Durations process are as follows:
aOE    Expert judgment
aOE    Analogous estimating
                                                   Developing a Project Schedule            115



    Parametric estimating
    Three-point estimating
    Group decision-making techniques
    Reserve analysis
Expert Judgment Expert judgment used includes staff members who will perform the
activities and is based on their experience with past similar activities. When estimating
durations, experts should consider the following:
    Resource levels
    Resource productivity
    Resource capability
    Risks
    Any other factors that can impact estimates
Analogous Estimating Analogous estimating is commonly used when little detail is avail-
able on the project. For a complete description of analogous estimating, see "Tools and
Techniques of Estimate Costs" later in this chapter.
Parametric Estimating Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method
that multiplies the quantity of work by the rate. It is considered to be a quick and low-cost
estimating technique, with a good level of accuracy when used with actual historical data
and current market conditions that take inflation or other factors into consideration. The
best way to describe it is with an example:
        Activity: install fi fteen 10x10 drapes.
        Average time to install one 10x10 drape, based on previous experience:
        30 minutes.
        Estimate: Therefore, installing 15 drapes at an average 30-minute installation time
        per drape results in an estimated duration of 7.5 hours.



                 The PMBOK(R) Guide states that parametric estimating can also be used
                 to determine time estimates for the entire project or portions of the
                 project.


Three-Point Estimating Three-point estimating uses the average of the following three
estimates to result in a fi nal estimate:
   Most Likely (ML) The estimate assumes there are no disasters and the activity can be
   completed as planned.
116a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



    Optimistic (O)a* a* This represents the fastest time frame in which your resource can com-
    plete the activity.
    Pessimistic (P)a* a* The estimate assumes the worst happens and it takes much longer than
    planned to get the activity completed.
The concept of the three-point estimate comes from the Program Evaluation and Review
Technique (PERT), which uses the following formula to determine the weighted average
using the three duration estimates:

                            (Optimistic + 4 x (Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6

In the following example, the Most Likely (ML) estimate = 15, the Optimistic (O) estimate
= 11, and the Pessimistic (P) estimate = 25.

                                          (11 + 4(15) + 25) / 6

Thus, the activity duration = 16.



Day of the Exam

This is another formula that would be helpful to add to scratch paper before you
begin the exam: (Optimistic + 4 x (Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6. The purpose in
creating a key on your scratch paper is perhaps it frees your mind to focus entirely
on the problem you are attempting to solve, and does not introduce further stress
caused by trying to remember equations.



Group Decision-Making Techniquesa* a* It is helpful to have multiple alternatives for
future actions when estimating activity durations, and the group decision-making
technique is an assessment process that delivers those alternatives. By engaging team
members, it helps to improve estimate accuracy and commitment to the emerging
estimates, which has the byproduct of helping win the hearts and minds of those
contributing to the project.
Reserve Analysisa* a* Reserve time--also called buffer/time reserves or contingency
reserve in the PMBOK(R) Guide--is the portion of time added to the activity to account
for schedule risk or uncertainty. To make sure the project schedule is not impacted, a
reserve time of the original estimate is built in to account for the problems that may be
encountered.
       Original activity duration to install fifteen 10x10 drapes: 7.5 hours.
       10 percent reserve time added: 45 minutes.
                                                    Developing a Project Schedulea*...       117




      Estimate: Therefore, the new activity duration is adjusted to include the reserve, result-
      ing in an estimated duration of 8.25 hours.

Outputs of Estimate Activity Durations
There are two outputs of the Estimate Activity Durations process you should know:
aOE   Activity duration estimates
aOE   Project documents updates
Activity Duration Estimatesa* a* Activity duration estimates are estimates of the required
work periods needed to complete the activity. This is a quantitative measure usually
expressed in hours, weeks, days, or months.
Final estimates should contain a range of possible results, such as X hours  10 hours, or a
percentage may be used to express the range.
      Original activity duration to install fifteen 10x10 drapes: 7.5 hours.
      Final estimate: 7.5 hours  1 hour. Therefore, the activity may take as little as
      6.5 hours or as much as 8.5 hours.
Project Documents Updatesa* a* The following information may need to be revisited and
updated as a result of this process:
aOE   Activity attributes
aOE   Assumptions made regarding resource availability and skill levels


Develop Schedule
The purpose of the Develop Schedule process is to create the project schedule. Here, start
and finish dates are created, activity sequences and durations are finalized, and the critical
path is determined. The Develop Schedule process cannot be completed until the following
processes of project planning have occurred:
aOE   Collect Requirements
aOE   Define Scope
aOE   Create WBS
aOE   Define Activities
aOE   Sequence Activities
aOE   Estimate Activity Resources
aOE   Estimate Activity Durations
aOE   Plan Human Resource Management

Tools and Techniques of Develop Schedule
The Develop Schedule process has several tools and techniques you can use:
       Schedule network analysis
       Critical path method
       Critical chain method
       Resource optimization techniques
       Modeling techniques
       Leads and lags
       Schedule compression
       Scheduling tool
Schedule Network Analysis Schedule network analysis involves calculating early and
late start dates and early and late fi nish dates for project activities to generate the project
schedule. In short, it generates the schedule through the use of the following analytical
techniques and methods:
       Critical path method
       Critical chain method
       Modeling techniques
       Resource optimization techniques



                     Calculations are performed without taking resource limitations into
                     consideration, so the dates are theoretical. Resource limitations and
                     other constraints are taken into consideration during the outputs of this
                     process.


Critical Path Method Critical path method (CPM), a schedule network analysis tech-
nique, determines the amount of float, or schedule flexibility, for each of the network paths
by calculating the earliest start date, earliest fi nish date, latest start date, and latest fi nish
date for each activity. This technique relies on sequential networks and a single duration
estimate for each activity. PDM can be used to perform CPM. Here is some information
related to CPM that you should know:
      Critical Path The critical path (CP) is generally the longest full path on the project.
      Any project activity with a float time that equals zero is considered a critical path task.
      The critical path can change under the following conditions:
            When activities become tasks on the critical path as a result of having used up all
            their float time
            When a milestone on the critical path is not met
                                                             Developing a Project Schedulea*...      121




  Floata* a* There are two types of float time, also called slack time:
   aOE        Total float (TF), or the amount of time you can delay the earliest start of a task
              without delaying the ending of the project
   aOE        Free float (FF), or the amount of time you can delay the start of a task without
              delaying the earliest start of a successor task
  Calculating the Forward and Backward Passa* a* A forward pass is used to calculate the
  early start and early finish date of each activity on a network diagram. To calculate a
  forward pass, follow these steps:
         1.    Begin with the first activity.
         2.    The calculation of the first activity begins with an early start date of zero. Add the
               duration of the activity to determine the early finish.
         3.    The early start date of the next activity is the early finish date of the previ-
               ous activity. Continue calculating the early start and early finish dates forward
               through all the network paths while following the existing dependencies.
         4.    When an activity has two connecting predecessors, the early start date would be
               the early finish of the predecessor that finishes last. (For example, suppose activity A
               has an early finish of 4 and activity B has an early finish of 5. If activities A and B
               both converge at activity C, then activity C would have an early start date of 5.)
  A backward pass is used to calculate the late start and late finish date of each activity on
  a network diagram. To calculate a backward pass, follow these steps:
         1.    Begin with the last activity. The late finish will be the same as the early finish date.
         2.    Subtract the duration of the activity from the end date to calculate late start. This
               becomes the late finish of its predecessors.
         3.    Continue calculating the latest start and latest finish dates moving backward
               through all of the network paths.
         4.    When an activity has two connecting predecessors, the late finish date would be
               the late start of the activity that follows. (For example, if activity C has a late start
               of 7 and both activity A and activity B connect to activity C, the late finish of both
               activity A and B would be 7.)
  Figure 3.17 summarizes a forward and backward pass.

    Calculating the Critical Patha* a* A critical path task is any task that cannot be changed
    without impacting the project end date. By definition, these are all tasks with zero float.
    To determine the CP duration of the project, add the duration of every activity with zero
    float.
    Another way to determine the critical path is by determining the longest path within the
    network diagram. This can be done by adding the duration of all the activities within
    each path of the network.
    Using Table 3.2, set up a network diagram using the activity number, activity descrip-
    tion, dependency, and duration. Next, practice calculating the early start, early finish,
    late start, and late finish dates. Check your answers against the dates shown on the chart
    and by referencing Figure 3.18.

    Calculating Expected Value Using PERT PERT and CPM are similar techniques: CPM
    uses the most likely duration to determine project duration, whereas PERT uses what's
    called expected value (or the weighted average). Expected value is calculated using the
    three-point estimates for activity duration.


                      For an explanation of how to calculate three-point estimates, see the tools
                      and techniques of the Estimate Activity Durations process.


    Calculating Standard Deviation The formula for standard deviation is as follows:

                                         (Pessimistic - Optimistic)/ 6


    For data that fits a bell curve, the following is true:
           Work will finish within  3 standard deviations 99.73 percent of the time.
           Work will finish within  2 standard deviations 95.44 percent of the time.
           Work will finish within  1 standard deviation 68.27 percent of the time.



standard Deviation

The higher the standard deviation is for an activity, the higher the risk. Since standard
deviation measures the difference between the pessimistic and the optimistic times, a
124a*...       Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project




greater spread between the two, which results in a higher number, indicates a greater
risk. Conversely, a low standard deviation means less risk.

One standard deviation gives you a 68 percent (rounded) probability, and two stan-
dard deviations give you a 95 percent (rounded) probability. For an example of calcu-
lating date ranges for project durations, see Chapter 4 of PMPa*a*(R): Project Management
Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.




Critical Chain Methoda* a* The critical chain method is a schedule network analysis
technique that will modify the project schedule by accounting for limited or restricted
resources. The modified schedule is calculated, and it often changes the critical path as a
result of adding duration buffers, which are nonworking activities added to help manage
the planned activity durations. The new critical path showing the resource restrictions is
called the critical chain.
Critical chain uses both deterministic (step-by-step) and probabilistic approaches. The fol-
lowing are steps in the critical chain process:
1.     Construct the schedule network diagram using activity duration estimates (you'll use
       nonconservative estimates in this method).
2.     Define dependencies.
3.     Define constraints.
4.     Calculate the critical path.
5.     Enter resource availability into the schedule.
6.     Recalculate for the critical chain.

A project buffer is placed at the end of the critical chain to help keep the finish date from
slipping. After the buffers are added, the planned activities are then scheduled at their latest
start and finish dates.
Resource Optimization Techniquesa* a* Resource optimization techniques are used when
the supply and demand of resources necessitate an adjustment to the schedule model. They
attempt to smooth out the peaks and valleys of total resource usage through strategic con-
sumption of float while also addressing any overcommitment of individual resources through
rescheduling or reassignment. Examples include but are not limited to the following:
     Resource Levelinga* a* Resource leveling attempts to smooth out the resource assignments
     to get tasks completed without overloading the resources and while trying to keep the
     project on schedule. This typically takes the form of allocating resources to critical path
     tasks first.
     Here are some examples of resource leveling:
       aOE   Delaying the start of a task to match the availability of a key team member
                                                   Developing a Project Schedule              125



         Adjusting the resource assignments so that more tasks are given to team members
         who are underallocated
         Requiring the resources to work mandatory overtime

   Resource Smoothing Resource smoothing is a technique that adjusts the schedule
   model by arranging the activities so that the requirements for resources do exceed the
   constraints of the project. The key difference between resource smoothing and resource
   leveling is that, with resource smoothing, the critical path of the project remains
   unchanged. The ability to delay an activity is limited by the amount of an activity's free
   and total float.


                  Resource leveling can cause the original critical path to change.




Modeling Techniques There are multiple types of modeling techniques that a project
manager can use in developing the schedule. Two examples that you should be familiar
with for the exam include what-if scenario analysis and simulation.
   What-If Scenario Analysis What-if scenario analysis evaluates different scenarios in
   order to predict their positive or negative effect on project objectives. According to the
   PMBOK(R) Guide, this is an analysis of the question "What if the situation represented
   by scenario `X' happens?" To support this effort, a schedule network analysis is per-
   formed using the schedule to calculate different scenarios, like the delay of a deliverable
   or a major weather event for a construction project.
   Simulation Taking different sets of activity assumptions, simulation calculates multiple
   project duration models using probability distributions constructed from three-point
   estimates to account for uncertainty. Simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo analy-
   sis use a range of probable activity durations for each activity, and those ranges are then
   used to calculate a range of probable duration results for the project itself. Monte Carlo
   runs the possible activity durations and schedule projections many, many times to come
   up with the schedule projections and their probability, critical path duration estimates,
   and float time.
Leads and Lags A lead accelerates the start date of an activity by the number of days
specified, whereas a lag delays the start date of an activity. Leads and lags were fi rst used in
the Sequence Activities process, discussed earlier in this chapter.
Schedule Compression Schedule compression is a form of mathematical analysis that's
used to shorten the project schedule without changing the project scope. To be effective,
work compressed must be based on those activities that fall on the critical path. There are
two types of schedule compression techniques:
   Crashing Crashing is a compression technique that looks at cost and schedule trade-
   offs. This involves adding resources to critical path tasks in order to shorten the length
126a*...      Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



      of the tasks and therefore the length of the project. Crashing the schedule can lead to
      increased risk, increased costs, and a change in the critical path.
      Fast Trackinga* a* Fast tracking is performing two tasks in parallel that were previously
      scheduled to start sequentially. Fast tracking can increase project risk and cause the
      project team to have to rework tasks, and it only works for activities that can be
      overlapped.
Scheduling Toola* a* The scheduling tools used are typically in the form of project manage-
ment software programs. They will automate the mathematical calculations and perform
resource-leveling functions.

Outputs of Develop Schedule
Know the following outputs of the Develop Schedule process:
aOE    Schedule baseline
aOE    Project schedule
aOE    Schedule data
aOE    Project calendars
aOE    Project management plan updates
aOE    Project documents updates
Schedule Baselinea* a* The schedule baseline can be described as the final, approved version of
the project schedule with baseline start and baseline finish dates and resource assignments.
The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that the schedule baseline is a designated version of the project
schedule that's derived from the schedule network analysis. The approved project schedule
becomes a part of the project management plan.



Exam Note

For the exam, remember that the project schedule is based on the timeline (derived from
the activity), the scope document (to help keep track of major milestones and deliver-
ables), and resource plans.



Project Schedulea* a* The project schedule details the start and finish dates for each project
activity as well as the resource assignments. In PMBOK(R) Guide terms, the project schedule
is considered preliminary until resources are assigned. The following are additional
elements of the project schedule:
aOE    The project schedule should be approved and signed off by stakeholders and functional
       managers.
aOE    For functional organizations, confirmation that resources will be available as outlined
       in the schedule should be obtained.

aOE    The schedule cannot be finalized until approval and commitment for the resource
       assignments outlined in it are received.
aOE    Once approved, the schedule becomes the schedule baseline for the remainder of the
       project.
The following are various ways of displaying the project schedule:
      Bar Chartsa* a* Also known as Gantt charts, these tools are commonly used to display
      schedule activities. They may show activity sequences, activity start and end dates,
      resource assignments, activity dependencies, and the critical path. Figure 3.19 shows a
      simple example that plots various activities against time.

      Project Schedule Network Diagramsa* a* Project schedule network diagrams usually show
      the activity dependencies and critical path. They will work as schedule diagrams when
      the start and finish dates are added to each activity.
      Milestone Chartsa* a* Milestone charts mark the completion of major deliverables or some
      other key events in the project. They can be displayed in a bar chart form, similar to a
      Gantt chart, or use a simple table format, as shown in Table 3.3. As the milestones are
      met, the Actual Date column within the table is filled in.

Schedule Dataa* a* The schedule data refers to documenting the supporting data for the
schedule. At least the following elements must be included within the schedule data:
aOE    Milestones
aOE    Schedule activities
aOE    Activity attributes
aOE    Assumptions
aOE    Constraints
aOE    Any other information that doesn't fit into the other categories
aOE    Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of resource histograms (sug-
       gested by the PMBOK(R) Guide)
Project Calendarsa* a* A project calendar is a template of sorts that clarifies the working days
and shifts that are available for scheduling activities.
Project Management Plan Updatesa* a* Updates may be made to the schedule baseline and the
schedule management plan.
Project Documents Updatesa* a* Updates may be made to the following project documents:
aOE    Activity resource requirements document
aOE    Activity attributes
aOE    Calendars
aOE    Risk register



Exam Essentials

Know the difference between the precedence diagramming method (PDM) and the
arrow diagramming method (ADM).a* a* PDM uses boxes or rectangles to represent the
activities (called nodes) that are connected with arrows showing the dependencies
between the activities. ADM places activities on the arrows (called activity on arrow),
which are connected to dependent activities with nodes.

Be able to describe the purpose of the Estimate Activity Resources process.a* a* The
purpose of Estimate Activity Resources is to determine the types and quantities of
resources (human, equipment, and materials) needed for each schedule activity within
a work package.

Be able to name the tools and techniques of Estimate Activity Durations.a* a* The tools
and techniques of Estimate Activity Durations are expert judgment, analogous esti-
mating, parametric estimating, three-point estimating, group decision-making tech-
niques, and reserve analysis.

Be able to define the difference between analogous estimating, parametric estimat-
ing, and bottom-up estimating.a* a* Analogous estimating is a top-down technique that
uses expert judgment and historical information. Parametric estimating multiplies the
quantity of work by the rate. Bottom-up estimating performs estimates for each work
item and rolls them up to a total.

Be able to calculate the critical path.a* a* The critical path includes the activities whose
durations add up to the longest path of the project schedule network diagram.
The critical path is calculated using the forward pass, backward pass, and float
calculations.

Be able to define a critical path task.a* a* A critical path task is a project activity with zero
float.

Be able to describe and calculate PERT duration estimates.a* a* This is a weighted aver-
age technique that uses three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. The
formula is as follows:


     (Optimistic + (4 x Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6

Be able to name the schedule compression techniques.a* a* The schedule compression
techniques are crashing and fast tracking.

Be able to describe a critical chain.a* a* The critical chain is the new critical path in a
modified schedule that accounts for limited resources.

Be able to name the outputs of the Develop Schedule process.a* a* The outputs are proj-
ect schedule, schedule baseline, schedule data, project calendars, project manage-
ment plan updates, and project documents updates.




Developing a Cost Management Plan
The purpose of the cost management plan is, naturally, to create, monitor, and control the
project costs. This plan is based on the project scope and documents the estimating tech-
niques that will be used as well as how the cost-related processes will be carried out.
130a*...       Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



      The project budget is created by carrying out three planning processes:
aOE    Plan Cost Management, which is primarily focused on the costs of resources to com-

Understand the Cost Management Plan
The cost management plan plays an important role within all of the Project Cost
Management Knowledge Area processes. The cost management plan is created during the
Plan Cost Management process and is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan (as
all subplans are). Using the preceding components, the cost management plan will guide the
project management team in carrying out the three cost-related processes.


Plan Cost Management
The cost management plan contains the following information:
aOE    Level of accuracy
aOE    Units of measure
                                            Developing a Cost Management Plana*...         131



aOE   Organizational procedures links
aOE   Control thresholds
aOE   Rules of performance measurement
aOE   Reporting formats
aOE   Process descriptions
  Keep in mind that throughout the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area, the cost
management plan serves as a guide for documenting and controlling the budget of the project.

Inputs of Plan Cost Management
Know the following four inputs of the Plan Cost Management process:
Project Management Plana* a* The project management plan contains elements used to create
the cost management plan focusing on, but not limited to, the following:
aOE   Scope baseline; elements like the project scope statement and WBS provide details for
      cost estimation and management
aOE   Schedule baseline, which helps clarify when project costs will be incurred
aOE   Other information, including cost-related scheduling, communication decisions,
      and risk
Project Chartera* a* The project charter has the summary budget, a key input to creating the
detailed project costs.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Several enterprise environmental factors can influence
the Plan Cost Management process, including but not limited to the organization's culture
and structure, marketplace conditions, currency exchange rates (if the project is multina-
tional), published commercial information such as resource cost rate information, and the
project management information system.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Financial controls procedures; historical information,
including a lessons learned knowledge base; financial databases; and existing formal and
informal cost estimating and budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines are a
few of the organizational process assets that help shape the Plan Cost Management process.

Tools and Techniques of Plan Cost Management
The three tools and techniques that the Plan Cost Management process uses are expert
judgement, analytical techniques, and meetings:
Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment brings invaluable perspective about prior similar proj-
ects attempted, as well as the existing environment that will affect the project. This can
also be key in considering whether to combine methods of cost planning and how to best
resolve differences between those methods.
Analytical Techniquesa* a* You may have many strategic options to consider when develop-
ing the cost management plan. Those options include self-funding, funding with equity, or
132         Chapter 3      Planning the Project



funding with debt. Financial options will be influenced by the organization's policies and
procedures, including but limited to payback period, return on investment, internal rate of
return, discounted cash flow, and net present value.
Meetings In the course of developing the cost management plan, members of project
teams may attend meetings to help with information exchange and decision making.
Depending on the meeting, the following members might be a part of the discussion to
include: the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, and any-
one having responsibility in this area.

Outputs of Plan Cost Management
For the exam, know that the output of the Plan Cost Management process is the cost
management plan.
Cost Management Plan        The cost management plan should establish the following:
      Units of measure, such as quantity and time measures, and currency to be used
      Level of precision, which is the degree to which activity cost estimates will be rounded
      up or down
      Level of accuracy, which is the acceptable range used in determining contingencies and
      realistic activity cost estimates
      Organizational procedures links, where the WBS provides the framework for the
      cost management plan to help foster consistency with estimates, budgets, and
      controls
      Control thresholds, which document the identified variation that can occur before
      some action needs to be taken
      Rules of performance measurement, like the rules for earned value management (EVM),
      and which techniques to use


                   For more detailed information on earned value management, see Practice
                   Standard for Earned Value Management, Second Edition (PMI (R), 2011).


      Reporting formats defining the form and frequency of various cost reports
      Process descriptions for the other cost management processes
      Additional details such as explanations of strategic funding choices, how to deal
      with currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the procedure for project cost
      recording


Estimate Costs
The purpose of the Estimate Costs process is to develop cost estimates for resources,
both human and material, required for all schedule activities and the overall project. This
                                                  Developing a Cost Management Plan                  133




includes weighing alternative options and examining risks and trade-offs. The cost-related
processes are governed by the cost management plan, which establishes the format and
conditions used to plan for project costs. It also outlines how you will estimate, budget, and
control project costs.
   Figure 3.21 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Estimate Costs
process.

Inputs of Estimate Costs
You should be familiar with these seven inputs of the Estimate Costs process:
       Cost management plan
       Human resource management plan
       Scope baseline
       Project schedule
134         Chapter 3        Planning the Project



      Risk register
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
Cost Management Plan The cost management plan is a key input that specifies how
project costs will be managed and controlled, including the method to be used and level of
accuracy targets required to estimate cost activity.
Human Resource Management Plan For the purposes of the Estimate Costs process, the
following elements of the human resource management plan should be considered:
      Personnel rates
      Project staffing attributes
      Employee recognition or rewards programs
Scope Baseline The following are included within the scope baseline and are used in
creating cost estimates:
      Project scope statement (key deliverables, constraints, and assumptions)
      WBS, which serves as the basis for estimating costs (project deliverables, control
      accounts)
      WBS dictionary


                      Scope definition is a key component of determining the estimated costs
                      and should be completed early within the project.


Project Schedule Activity resource requirements and activity duration estimates are used
from within the project schedule and serve as key inputs when estimating costs.
Risk Register From within the risk register, the cost of mitigating, avoiding, or trans-
ferring risks will be used for estimating costs, particularly when the risks have negative
impacts to the project.
Enterprise Environmental Factors According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following enter-
prise environmental factors should be considered in this process:
      Market conditions, which help you to understand the materials, goods, and ser-
      vices available in the market and what terms and conditions exist to procure those
      resources.
      Published commercial information, which refers to resource cost rates. These are
      obtained from commercial databases or published seller price lists.
Organizational Process Assets The organizational process assets include historical
information and lessons learned on previous projects of similar scope and complexity.
Also useful are cost-estimating worksheets from past projects as templates for the current
project.

Tools and Techniques of Estimate Costs
The following list includes the tools and techniques of the Estimate Costs process:
    Expert judgment
    Analogous estimating
    Parametric estimating
    Bottom-up estimating
    Three-point estimating
    Reserve analysis
    Cost of quality
    Project management software
    Vendor bid analysis
    Group decision-making techniques
Expert Judgment Cost estimates from individuals who have had previous experience in
the past on similar projects can be used. Information from those who have experience in
performing the activities becomes valuable for calculating accurate estimates.
Analogous Estimating Analogous estimating, also called top-down estimating, is a form
of expert judgment. This technique uses actual costs of a similar activity completed on
a previous project to determine the cost estimate of the current activity. It can be used
when the previous activities being compared are similar to the activities being estimated.
Analogous estimating may also be useful when detailed information about the project is
not yet available. Top-down estimating techniques are also used to estimate total project
cost to look at the estimate as a whole. Although analogous estimating is considered to be a
quick and low-cost estimating technique, it is low in accuracy.



                 The PMBOK (R) Guide states that analogous estimating can also be used to
                 determine overall project duration and cost estimates for the entire project
                 (or phases of the project).


Parametric Estimating Parametric estimating uses historical information and statistical
data to calculate cost estimates. For a complete description of parametric estimating, see
"Tools and Techniques of Estimate Activity Durations" later in this chapter.
Bottom-Up Estimating This technique estimates costs associated with every activity indi-
vidually by decomposing that activity into smaller pieces of work until the cost of the work
can be confidently estimated. The costs of the activity are then rolled up to the original
activity level.
Three-Point Estimating Three-point estimates are used in this process when the project
team is attempting to improve estimates and account for risk by estimating uncertainty.
136a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Reserve Analysisa* a* During this process, cost reserves (or contingencies) and management
reserves are added. Cost contingencies can be aggregated and assigned to a schedule activ-
ity or a WBS work package level. Contingency reserve is added to account for existing
known risk, whereas management reserves are added to account for unknown risk.
Cost of Qualitya* a* The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or ser-
vice of the project according to the quality standards. You can find additional information
on cost of quality in "Tools and Techniques of Plan Quality" later in this chapter.
Project Management Softwarea* a* The project management software tool can help quickly
determine estimates given different variables and alternatives.
Vendor Bid Analysisa* a* Vendor bid analysis involves gathering information from vendors
to help establish cost estimates. This can be accomplished by requesting bids or quotes or
working with some of the trusted vendor sources for estimates.
Group Decision-Making Techniquesa* a* In this assessment process, an evaluation of mul-
tiple alternatives is performed to determine the results future actions might bring. Group
decision-making techniques are valuable in improving estimate accuracy and commitment
to the determined estimates.

Outputs of Estimate Costs
The following are three outputs that result from the Estimate Costs process:
aOE    Activity cost estimates
aOE    Basis of estimates
aOE    Project documents updates
Activity Cost Estimatesa* a* Activity cost estimates are quantitative amounts that reflect the
cost of the resources needed to complete the project activities. The following resources are
commonly needed:
aOE    Human resources
aOE    Material
aOE    Equipment
aOE    Information technology needs
aOE    Any contingency reserve amounts and inflation factors
Basis of Estimatesa* a* Basis of estimates is the supporting detail for the activity cost esti-
mates and includes any information that describes how the estimates were developed, what
assumptions were made during the Estimate Costs process, and any other details needed.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the basis of estimates should include the following as a
minimum:
aOE    Description of how the estimate was developed or the basis for the estimate
aOE    Description of the assumptions made about the estimates or the method used to deter-
       mine them
                                                    Developing a Cost Management Plan                 137



    Description of the constraints
    Range of possible results
    Confidence level regarding the final estimates
Project Documents Updates Updates to project documents, as a result of determining
cost estimates, commonly include the following to account for cost variances and refi ned
estimates:
    Project budget
    Risk register


Determine Budget
The Determine Budget process is primarily concerned with determining the cost baseline,
which represents the project budget. This process aggregates the cost estimates of activities
and establishes a cost baseline for the project that is used to measure performance of the
project throughout the remaining process groups. By the end of this process, the project
schedule and the project budget will both have been created.
   Figure 3.22 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Determine
Budget process.

Inputs of Determine Budget
The Determine Budget process contains nine inputs:
aOE    Cost management plan
aOE    Scope baseline
aOE    Activity cost estimates
aOE    Basis of estimates
aOE    Project schedule
aOE    Resource calendars
aOE    Risk register
aOE    Agreements
aOE    Organizational process assets
Cost Management Plana* a* As we have seen earlier in the chapter, the cost management plan
lays out how project costs will be managed and controlled.
Scope Baselinea* a* When determining the budget, the following is used within the scope baseline:
aOE    Project scope statement (describes the constraints of the project)
aOE    WBS (shows how the project deliverables are related to their components and typically
       provides control account information)
aOE    WBS dictionary
Activity Cost Estimatesa* a* Activity cost estimates are determined for each activity within a
work package and then summed to determine the total estimate for a work package.
Basis of Estimatesa* a* Basis of estimates contains all the supporting detail regarding the esti-
mates. Assumptions regarding indirect costs and whether they will be included in the proj-
ect budget should be considered. Indirect costs cannot be directly linked to any one project
but are allocated among several projects.
Project Schedulea* a* The schedule contains information that is helpful in developing the bud-
get, such as start and end dates for activities, milestones, and so on. Based on the informa-
tion in the schedule, budget expenditures for calendar periods can be determined.
Resource Calendarsa* a* Resource calendars help determine costs in calendar periods and over
the length of the project because they describe what resources are needed and available for
the project.
Risk Registera* a* When determining the budget, a review of the risk register will help to com-
pile the costs for risk response.
Agreementsa* a* Agreements, such as contracts, include cost information that should be
included in the overall project budget.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The organizational process assets used include the follow-
ing items:
aOE    Cost budgeting tools

    Policies and procedures of the organization regarding budgeting exercises
    Reporting methods


                  Outputs from other planning processes, including Create WBS, Develop
                  Schedule, and Estimate Costs, must be completed prior to working on Deter-
                  mine Budget because some of their outputs become the inputs to this process.


Tools and Techniques of Determine Budget
Know the following tools and techniques of the Determine Budget process for the exam:
    Cost aggregation
    Reserve analysis
    Expert judgment
    Historical relationships
    Funding limit reconciliation
Cost Aggregation Cost aggregation is the process of tallying the schedule activity cost
estimates at the work package level and then totaling the work package levels to higher-
level WBS component levels. All costs can then be aggregated to obtain a total project cost.
Reserve Analysis In this process, reserve analysis outlines contingency reserves for unplanned
project scope and unplanned project costs. Contingency reserves are included as part of the
cost baseline, whereas management reserves are not.
Expert Judgment Expert judgment in calculating the project budget will include informa-
tion from those with past experience in conducting similar projects.
Historical Relationships Analogous estimates and parametric estimates can be used
to help determine total project costs. Actual costs from previous projects of similar size,
scope, and complexity are used to estimate the costs for the current project. This is help-
ful when detailed information about the project is not available or it's early in the project
phases and not much information is known.
Funding Limit Reconciliation Funding limit reconciliation involves reconciling the
amount of funds to be spent with the amount of funds budgeted for the project. The
organization or the customer sets these limits. Reconciling the project expenses will
require adjusting the schedule so that the expenses can be smoothed. This can be done
by placing imposed date constraints on work packages or other WBS components in the
project schedule.

Outputs of Determine Budget
There are three outputs of the Determine Budget process:
Cost Baseline The cost baseline provides the basis for measurement, over time, of the
expected cash flows (or funding disbursements) against the requirements. Adding the costs
140       Chapter 3        Planning the Project



of the WBS elements by time periods develops the cost baseline. This is also known as the
project's time-phased budget. Most projects span some length of time, and most organiza-
tions time the funding with the project.

Cost baselines can be displayed graphically, as shown in Figure 3.23.

The cost baseline should contain the costs for all of the expected work on the project, as
well as the contingency reserves set aside to account for known risks. Large projects may
have more than one cost performance baseline.



                 Cost baselines are displayed as an S curve. The reason for this is that
                 project spending starts out slowly, gradually increases over the proj-
                 ect's life until it reaches a peak, and then tapers off again as the project
                 wraps up.

Project Funding Requirements Project funding requirements describe the need for funding
over the course of the project and are derived from the cost performance baseline. Funding
requirements can be expressed in monthly, quarterly, or annual increments or other incre-
ments that are appropriate for your project.
Figure 3.24 shows the cost baseline, the funding requirements, and the expected cash flows
plotted on the S curve. This example shows a negative amount of management reserve.
The difference between the funding requirements and the cost performance baseline at the
end of a project is the management reserve. Management reserves are set aside to deal with
unknown risks.

    Any other project documents that include cost estimates


                       Don't forget that the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area has one
                       more process: Control Costs. Look for a discussion of this process in
                       Chapter 5 when we discuss the Monitoring and Controlling process group.


exam essentials

Be able to identify and describe the primary output of the Estimate Costs process. The
primary output of Estimate Costs is activity cost estimates. These estimates are quanti-
tative amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources
needed to complete the project activities.
Be able to identify the tools and techniques of the Estimate Costs process. The tools
and techniques of Estimate Costs are expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric
estimating, bottom-up estimating, three-point estimating, reserve analysis, cost of quality,
project management software, vendor bid analysis, and group decision-making techniques.
Be able to identify the tools and techniques of the Determine Budget process. The
tools and techniques of Determine Budget are cost aggregation, reserve analysis, expert
judgment, historical relationships, and funding limit reconciliation.
Be able to describe the cost baseline. The cost baseline is the authorized, time-phased
cost of the project when using budget-at-completion calculations. The cost baseline is
displayed as an S curve.
142a*...          Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project




Be able to describe project funding requirements.a*a* Project funding requirements are an
output of the Determine Budget process. They detail the funding requirements needed on
the project by time period (monthly, quarterly, or annually).




Developing a Quality Management Plan
Preventing the occurrence of defects and reducing the cost of quality can be critical to a project's
success. To this end, a quality management plan is created out of the Plan Quality Management
process and is responsible for guiding the project management team in carrying out the three
quality-related processes. This plan should be based on the project scope and requirements.
   In addition to creating the quality management plan, the Plan Quality Management
process is responsible for creating the process improvement plan. This plan measures the
effectiveness of and improves the project management processes. Continuous improve-
ment is a recurring theme throughout the PMBOK(R) Guide and is an important element of
modern quality theories. The ideas, concepts, and theories from key quality theorists (such
as Deming, Juran, and Crosby) played an important role in shaping the Project Quality
Management Knowledge Area processes.
   The Plan Quality Management process is concerned with targeting quality standards
that are relevant to the project at hand and devising a plan to meet and satisfy those stan-
dards. The quality management plan is the result of the Plan Quality Management process,
which describes how the quality policy will be implemented by the project management
team. The result of this process also produces the process improvement plan, which docu-
ments the actions for analyzing processes to ultimately increase customer value.
   Figure 3.25 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Quality
Management process.

Inputs of Plan Quality Management
The Plan Quality Management process contains the following inputs:
    Project management plan
    Stakeholder register
    Risk register
    Requirements documentation
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
Project Management Plan        The following are used from within the project manage-
ment plan:
    Scope baseline, including the project scope statement, which defines the project deliv-
    erables, objectives, and threshold and acceptance criteria, all of which are used within
    the quality processes; the WBS; and the WBS dictionary
    Schedule baseline
    Cost baseline
    Other management plans that might influence the overall project quality
Stakeholder Register A list of stakeholders is used in this process to understand the expec-
tations of all stakeholders. Quality has been achieved when the expectations of all stake-
holders have been met.
Risk Register The risk register outlines the documented information pertaining to risk,
including the list of risks. Dealing with risk is tied into quality and should therefore be con-
sidered in the Plan Quality Management process.
Requirements Documentation To help ensure that stakeholder expectations are met,
requirements documentation becomes a key instrument to help plan how quality control
will function on the project.
Enterprise Environmental Factors The project manager should consider any standards,
regulations, guidelines, quality policies, or rules that exist concerning the work of the proj-
ect when writing the quality plan.
Organizational Process Assets The quality policy is included from within the organiza-
tional process assets and used in this process. The quality policy is a guideline published by
executive management that describes what quality policies should be adopted for projects
the company undertakes.

Standards and Regulations

A standard is something that's approved by a recognized body and that employs rules,
guidelines, or characteristics that should be followed. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area is designed to be in alignment with the
ISO standards.

A regulation is mandatory. Governments or institutions almost always impose regula-
tions, although organizations might also have their own, self-imposed regulations.




Tools and Techniques of Plan Quality Management
Know the following tools and techniques of the Plan Quality Management process:
aOE    Cost-benefit analysis
aOE    Cost of quality
aOE    Seven basic quality tools
aOE    Benchmarking
aOE    Design of experiments
aOE    Statistical sampling
aOE    Additional quality planning tools
aOE    Meetings
Cost-Benefit Analysisa* a* In the case of quality management, cost of quality trade-offs should
be considered from within cost-benefit analysis. The benefits of meeting quality require-
ments are as follows:
aOE    Stakeholder satisfaction is increased.
aOE    Costs are lower.
aOE    Productivity is higher.
aOE    There is less rework.
Cost of Qualitya* a* The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or ser-
vice of the project according to the quality standards. Costs are broken into two categories:
cost of conformance, which is money spent during the project to avoid failures, and cost
of nonconformance, which is money spent during and after the project because of failures.
Four costs are associated with the cost of quality: prevention costs and appraisal costs (con-
formance) and internal and external failure costs (nonconformance).
      Prevention Costsa* a* Prevention costs are the costs associated with satisfying customer
      requirements by producing a product without defects.
                                           Developing a Quality Management Plan                 145




  Appraisal Costs Appraisal costs are the costs expended to examine the product or pro-
  cess and make certain the requirements are being met.
  Failure Costs Failure costs are what it costs when things don't go according to plan.
  Failure costs are also known as cost of poor quality. Two types of failure costs exist:
       Internal failure costs
       External failure costs
  There are two categories of costs within COQ, as listed in Table 3.4.

Ta b l e 3 . 4    Cost of conformance and nonconformance


Conformance costs               Nonconformance costs

Prevention costs                Internal failure costs

Appraisal costs                 External failure costs




                   Quality must be planned into the project, not inspected after the fact, to
                   ensure that the product or service meets stakeholders' expectations.

Quality theorists and quality techniques are responsible for the rise of the quality man-
agement movement and the theories behind the cost of quality. Figure 3.26 highlights
four quality theorists, along with their ideas, with whom you should be very familiar
with for the exam.

                         Shewhart      * Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle



  Philip B. Crosby Philip B. Crosby is known for devising the zero defects practice,
  which means to do it right the fi rst time. If the defect is prevented from occurring in
146           Chapter 3      Planning the Project



      the fi rst place, costs are lower, conformance to requirements is easily met, and the cost
      measurement for quality becomes the cost of nonconformance rather than the cost of
      rework.
      Joseph M. Juran Joseph M. Juran is known for the fitness for use premise, which
      means the stakeholders' and customers' expectations are met or exceeded and reflects
      their views of quality. Juran proposed that there could be grades of quality.



                     Grade is a category for products or services that are of the same type but
                     have differing technical characteristics. Quality describes how well the
                     product or service (or characteristics of the product or service) fulfills the
                     requirements. Low quality is usually not an acceptable condition, whereas
                     low grade might be.


      W. Edwards Deming W. Edwards Deming suggested that as much as 85 percent of
      the cost of quality is management's responsibility, which came to be known as the
      85 percent rule or rule of 85. He believed that workers need to be shown what accept-
      able quality is and that they need to be provided with the right training so that quality
      and continuous improvement become natural elements of the working environment.
      Deming was also a major contributor to the modern quality movement and theories,
      which emphasize a more proactive approach to quality management (prevention over
      inspection). For example, he documented 14 points that summarize how management
      can transform their organization to one that is effective. This and his body of work have
      been credited for launching the Total Quality Management (TQM) movement. He also
      popularized the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, also referred to as the Deming Cycle, which
      focuses on continuous improvement.
      Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and
      variation reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project. There are two
      Six Sigma methodologies:
               DMADV (define, measure, analyze, design, and verify) is used to develop new
               processes or products at the Six Sigma level.
               DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) is used to improve
               existing processes or products.
      Walter Shewhart According to some sources, Walter Shewhart is the grandfather of
      statistical quality control and the Plan-Do-Check-Act model, which was further popu-
      larized by Deming. Shewhart developed statistical tools to examine when a corrective
      action must be applied to a process. He is also known for the control chart techniques.
      Kaizen Approach The Kaizen approach-- kaizen means improvement in Japanese--is
      a technique in which all project team members and managers should be constantly
      watching for quality improvement opportunities. The Kaizen approach states that the

      quality of the people should be improved first and then the quality of the products or
      service.
Seven Basic Quality Toolsa* a* 7QC tools, known in the industry as the seven basic qual-
ity tools, help to solve quality-related problems in the context of the Plan-Do-Check-Act
model. The Seven Basic Quality tools include the following:
aOE    Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams or Ishikawa dia-
       grams. A more complete explanation of this tool occurs in the Identify Risks process
       description later in this chapter. These diagrams help to trace an issue to its root
       cause.
aOE    Flowcharts show the relationships between the process steps. In regard to quality
       planning, flowcharting helps the project team identify quality issues before they
       occur.
aOE    Checksheets help to get facts organized in a manner that will facilitate the effective col-
       lection of useful data about a potential quality problem. Also called tally sheets, they
       are useful as a checklist when gathering data.
aOE    Pareto diagrams can help reveal the key few sources that are responsible for causing
       most of a problem's effects. These diagrams are normally in the special form of a verti-
       cal bar chart.
aOE    Histograms are also a special form of a bar chart that help with pattern recognition
       around the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a statistical distribution. The key
       difference between histograms and other control charts is that a histogram is not influ-
       enced by time on the variations within a distribution.
aOE    Control charts help determine if a process is stable and whether process variances are
       in or out of control.
aOE    Scatter diagrams, also called correlation charts, are plot ordered pairs (X,Y) used to
       study the relationship between two variables.

Benchmarkinga* a* Benchmarking is a process of comparing previous similar activi-
ties to the current project activities to provide a standard against which to measure
performance.
Design of Experimentsa* a* Design of experiments (DOE) is a statistical technique attributed
to Genichi Taguchi that identifies the elements--or variables--that will have the greatest
effect on overall project outcomes. DOE provides a statistical framework that allows the
variables that have the greatest effect on overall project outcomes to be changed at once
instead of one at a time.
Statistical Samplinga* a* Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from
the whole population and inspecting them to determine whether they fall within acceptable
variances.
Additional Quality Planning Toolsa* a* The PMBOK(R) Guide lists additional tools, as
described in Table 3.5.
148a*...       Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Ta b l e 3 . 5 a* a* Quality planning tools


Tool                         Description

Brainstorming                Used to generate ideas within a large group. A brainstorming
                             session can also use and review information obtained using the
                             nominal group technique.

Affinity diagrams            Used to group and organize thoughts and facts; can be used in
                             conjunction with brainstorming.

Force field analysis         A method of examining the drive and resistance of change.

Nominal group                Brainstorming sessions consisting of small groups. The ideas of
techniques                   these sessions are later reviewed by a larger group.

Matrix diagrams              Used as a decision-making tool, particularly when several options
                             or alternatives are available.

Prioritization matrices      Used to prioritize complex issues that have numerous criteria for
                             decision making.



Meetingsa* a* Meetings are used by the project team to assemble the quality management plan
using a mixture of the tools and techniques described earlier in this section.


Outputs of Plan Quality Management
There are five outputs of the Plan Quality Management process:
aOE    Quality management plan
aOE    Process improvement plan
aOE    Quality metrics
aOE    Quality checklists
aOE    Project documents updates
Quality Management Plana* a* The project manager in cooperation with the project staff
writes the quality management plan. The plan should be based on the project scope and
requirements to successfully prevent defects from occurring, therefore reducing the cost of
quality.
The quality management plan includes the following elements:
       aOE   Description of how the project management team will carry out the quality policy
       aOE   Resources needed to carry out the quality plan
       aOE   Responsibilities of the project team in implementing quality
                                        Developing a Quality Management Plan                149



    All the processes and procedures the project team and organization should use to sat-
    isfy quality requirements, including the following items:
             Quality control
             Quality assurance techniques
             Continuous improvement processes
Process Improvement Plan The process improvement plan focuses on fi nding inefficien-
cies in a process or activity and eliminating them. The following elements are among those
included in the process improvement plan:
        Process boundaries, which describe the purpose for the process and its expected
        start and end dates
        Process configuration so that you know what processes are performed and when
        and how they interact
        Process metrics
        Any specific elements that should be targeted for improvement
Quality Metrics A quality metric, also known as operational defi nition, describes what is
being measured and how it will be measured during the Control Quality process.
Quality Checklists Checklists provide a means to determine whether the required steps in
a process have been followed. As each step is completed, it's checked off the list.
Project Documents Updates      The following project documents may need to be updated:
        Stakeholder register
        Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)
        WBS and WBS dictionary


                 Like with previous knowledge areas, the Quality Management Knowledge
                 Area has other processes not included in the Planning process group:
                 Perform Quality Assurance is in the Executing process group, and Control
                 Quality is in the Monitoring and Controlling process group. Look for these
                 processes in Chapters 4 and 5 of this book.




exam essentials

Be able to identify the benefits of meeting quality requirements. The benefits of meet-
ing quality requirements include increased stakeholder satisfaction, lower costs, higher
productivity, and less rework, and they are discovered during the Plan Quality process.

Be able to define the cost of quality (COQ). The COQ is the total cost to produce the
product or service of the project according to the quality standards. These costs include
150        Chapter 3      Planning the Project




all the work necessary to meet the product requirements for quality. The three costs
associated with cost of quality are prevention, appraisal, and failure costs (also known
as cost of poor quality).

Be able to name four people associated with COQ and some of the techniques
they helped establish. They are Crosby, Juran, Deming, and Shewhart. Some of
the techniques they helped to establish are TQM, Six Sigma, cost of quality, and
continuous improvement. The Kaizen approach concerns continuous improvement
and specifies that people should be improved first.

Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Plan Quality Management
process. The Plan Quality Management process consists of cost-benefit analysis,
cost of quality, seven basic quality tools, benchmarking, design of experiments,
statistical sampling, additional quality planning tools, and meetings.




Developing a Human Resource
Management Plan
The project manager creates a human resource management plan by carrying out a process
called Plan Human Resource Management. Through this process, roles and responsibili-
ties of the project team members are defi ned and the strategies for using and managing the
project team are documented. The high-level purpose of the plan itself is to create an effec-
tive project organization structure.
    The Plan Human Resource Management process documents the roles and responsibili-
ties of individuals or groups for various project elements and then documents the report-
ing relationships for each. Reporting relationships can be assigned to groups as well as to
individuals, and the groups or individuals might be internal or external to the organization
or a combination of both. This process will result in the creation of the human resource
management plan, which considers factors such as the availability of resources, skill levels,
training needs, and more.



                 For more detailed information on the Plan Human Resource Management
                 process, see Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources," of PMP (R): Project
                 Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.

  Figure 3.27 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Human
Resource Management process.

Inputs of Plan Human Resource Management
Inputs of the Plan Human Resource Management process you should know are as follows:
Project Management Plana* a* The human resource management plan borrows several ele-
ments from the project management plan, including but not limited to the following:
aOE   The project life cycle and the processes that will be applied to each phase
aOE   Defining how work will be performed to meet project objectives
aOE   A change management plan that documents the monitoring and controlling of changes
aOE   A configuration management plan that documents how configuration management will
      be performed
aOE   The maintenance of project baselines
aOE   Needs and methods of communicating with stakeholders

Activity Resource Requirementsa* a* Human resources are needed to perform and complete
the activities outlined in the activity resource requirements output of the Estimate Activity
Resources process. During the Plan Human Resource Management process, these resources
are defined in further detail.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Enterprise environmental factors play a key role in
determining human resource roles and responsibilities. The following is a list of factors that
are used:
aOE   Organizational factors
aOE   Existing human resources and marketplace conditions
aOE   Personnel policies
152a*...      Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



aOE    Technical factors
aOE    Interpersonal factors
aOE    Location and logistics
aOE    Political factors
aOE    Organizational structures
aOE    Collective bargaining agreements
aOE    Economic conditions
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The following elements of the organizational process assets
are used in this process:
aOE    Organizational processes and standardized role descriptions
aOE    Templates and checklists
aOE    Historical information
aOE    Escalation procedures for handling issues within the team

Tools and Techniques of Plan Human Resource Management
The following are tools and techniques of the Plan Human Resource Management process
that you should be familiar with:
aOE    Organization charts and position descriptions
aOE    Networking
aOE    Organizational theory
aOE    Expert judgment
aOE    Meetings

Organization Charts and Position Descriptions
The following information is presented in organization charts and position descriptions:
Hierarchical Chartsa* a* Hierarchical charts, like a WBS, are designed in a top-down format.
Two types of hierarchical charts that can be used are OBS and RBS:
aOE    Organization breakdown structure (OBS), which displays departments, work units, or
       teams in an organization and their respective work packages
aOE    Resource breakdown structure (RBS), which breaks down the work of the project
       according to the types of resources needed
Matrix-Based Chartsa* a* Matrix-based charts are used to show the type of resource and
the responsibility that resource has in the project. You can use a couple of types of
matrix-based charts:
aOE    Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) is displayed as a chart with resource names
       listed in each column and project phases or WBS elements listed as the rows. Indicators
       in the intersections show where the resources are needed.

aOE    A RACI chart is a type of RAM. Table 3.6 shows a sample portion of an RACI chart
       for a software development team. In this example, the RACI chart shows the roles and
       expectations of each participant.
The letters in the acronym RACI are the designations shown in Table 3.6:
       R = Responsible for performing the work
       A = Accountable, the one who is responsible for producing the deliverable or work
       package and approves or signs off on the work
       C = Consult, someone who has input to the work or decisions
       I = Inform, someone who must be informed of the decisions or results

Text-Oriented Formatsa* a* Text-oriented formats are used when there is a significant amount
of detail to record. These are also called position descriptions or role-responsibility-authority
forms. Text-oriented formats typically provide the following information:
aOE    Role
aOE    Responsibility
aOE    Authority of the resource
Other Sections of the Project Management Plana* a* Other subsidiary plans of the project
management plan might also describe roles and responsibilities.


Networking
Networking in this context means human resource networking. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, several types of networking activities exist:
aOE    Proactive communication
aOE    Lunch meetings
aOE    Informal conversations
154a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



aOE    Trade conferences
aOE    Symposia

Organizational Theory
Organizational theory refers to all the theories that attempt to explain what makes people,
teams, and work units behave.

Expert Judgment
Expert judgment helps inform the human resource management plan by
aOE    Listing the preliminary requirements for the required skills
aOE    Assessing the roles required for the project based on standardized role descriptions
aOE    Determining number of resources and level of effort needed to meet project objectives
aOE    Determining reporting relationships
aOE    Providing guidelines on leading time required for staffing
aOE    Identifying risks associated with staff acquisition, retention, and release plans
aOE    Using programs for complying with contracts, both with government and unions

Meetings
Meetings help in the planning of human resources and allow team members to reach con-
sensus on the human resource management plan.


Outputs of Plan Human Resource Management
There is only one output of the Plan Human Resource Management process: the human
resource management plan.
    The human resource management plan documents how human resources should be
defined, staffed, managed and controlled, and released from the project when their activi-
ties are complete. This plan is meant to clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of the
project team and to create an effective project organization structure. As a result, guidance
is provided on how resources are to be used and managed throughout the project.
    This output has the following three components:
Roles and Responsibilitiesa* a* The roles and responsibilities component includes the list of
roles and responsibilities for the project team. It can take the form of the RAM or RACI,
or the roles and responsibilities can be recorded in text format. The following key elements
should be included in the roles and responsibilities documentation:
aOE    Role describes which part of the project the individuals or teams are accountable for.
       This should also include a description of authority levels, responsibilities, and what
       work is not included as part of the role.
                             Developing a Human Resource Management Plan                    155



    Authority describes the amount of authority the resource has to make decisions, dic-
    tate direction, and approve the work.
    Responsibility describes the work required to complete the project activities.
    Competency describes the skills and ability needed to perform the project activities.
Project Organizational Charts The project organizational charts display project team
members and their reporting relationships in the project.
Staffing Management Plan The staffi ng management plan documents how and when
human resources are introduced to the project and the criteria for releasing them. The staff-
ing management plan should be updated throughout the project. The following elements
should be considered and included in the staffi ng management plan:
    Staff acquisition describes how team members are acquired, where they're located, and
    the costs for specific skills and expertise.
    Resource calendars describe the time frames in which the resources will be needed on
    the project and when the recruitment process should begin.
    Staff release plan describes how project team members will be released at the end of
    their assignment, including reassignment procedures.
    Training needs describe any training plans needed for team members who don't have
    the required skills or abilities to perform project tasks.
    Recognition and rewards describe the systems used to reward and reinforce desired
    behavior.
    Compliance details regulations that must be met and any human resource policies the
    organization has in place that deal with compliance issues.
    Safety includes safety policies and procedures that are applicable to the project or
    industry and should be included in the staffing management plan.



                 Don't forget that the Project Human Resource Management Knowledge
                 Area has three more processes: Acquire Project Team, Develop Project
                 Team, and Manage Project Team. Look for a discussion of these processes
                 in Chapter 4 when we discuss the Executing process group.

Developing a Communications
Management Plan
Communications plays an important role in effectively and efficiently carrying out a project--
with successful results! Like other plans, it should be as detailed as needed for the project at
hand and should be based on the project organization structure and stakeholder requirements.
This plan is responsible for managing the flow of project information and is created out of
the Plan Communications process.
   Keep in mind that, according to PMI(R), a good project manager spends up to 90 percent
of their time communicating. Therefore, the communications management plan should be
well thought out and clearly documented.
   The Plan Communications Management process involves determining the communica-
tion needs of the stakeholders by defi ning the types of information needed, the format for
communicating the information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it. All of
this is documented in the communications management plan, which is an output of this
process. The total number of existing communication channels is also calculated in this
process.
   Figure 3.28 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan
Communications Management process.

Inputs of Plan Communications Management
Know the following inputs of the Plan Communications Management process:
    Project management plan
    Stakeholder register
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
Project Management Plan The project management plan will provide direction on how
information on the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed.
Stakeholder Register The stakeholder register is a list of all the project stakeholders and
contains additional information, including their potential influence on the project and their
classifications.
Enterprise Environmental Factors All enterprise environmental factors can be used
within the Plan Communications Management process. Special attention should
be given to the organizational structure and culture as well as external stakeholder
requirements. This information will be key to managing the flow of the project's
information.
Organizational Process Assets The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that all the elements described
in the enterprise environmental factors can be used in this process. Particular consideration
should be given to lessons learned and historical information.


                 The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that there is a difference between effective
                 and efficient communication. Effective communication refers to provid-
                 ing the information in the right format for the intended audience at the
                 right time. Efficient communication refers to providing the appropriate
                 information at the right time--that is, only the information that's needed
                 at the time.



Tools and Techniques of Plan Communications
Management
The Plan Communications Management process includes the following tools and
techniques:
    Communication requirements analysis
    Communication technology
    Communication models
    Communication methods
    Meetings
158a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Communication Requirements Analysis
Communication requirements analysis involves analyzing and determining the communica-
tion needs of the project stakeholders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are several
sources of information you can examine to help determine these needs:
aOE    Company and departmental organizational charts
aOE    Stakeholder responsibility relationships
aOE    Other departments and business units involved in the project
aOE    The number of resources involved in the project and where they're located in relation
       to project activities
aOE    Internal needs that the organization may need to know about the project
aOE    External needs that organizations such as the media, government, or industry groups
       might have that require communication updates
aOE    Stakeholder information (documented in the stakeholder register and stakeholder man-
       agement strategy outputs of Identify Stakeholders)
   The preceding list goes through analysis to make certain that information that is valu-
able to the stakeholders is being supplied. It is important to know the number of commu-
nication channels, also known as lines of communication, that exist. Figure 3.29 shows an
example of a network model with six stakeholders included.

                                          between participants



   The nodes are the participants, and the lines show the connection between them all. The
formula for calculating the lines of communication is as follows (where n represents total
participants):

                                 lines of communication = n(n - 1) / 2

  Figure 3.29 shows six participants. When you plug the total participants into the for-
mula, the result is a total of 15 communication channels:

                                          6(6 - 1) / 2 = 15


Day of the Exam

This is another formula that would helpful to add to scratch paper before you begin the
exam: lines of communication = n(n - 1) / 2.


Communication Technology
Communication technology examines the methods (or technology) used to communicate
the information to, from, and among the stakeholders. This tool and technique examines
the technology elements that might affect project communications.
   The following are examples of methods used when communicating:
aOE   Written
aOE   Spoken
aOE   Email
aOE   Formal status reports
aOE   Meetings
aOE   Online databases
aOE   Online schedules

Communication Models
Communication models depict how information is transmitted from the sender and how it's
received by the receiver. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the key components of a com-
munication model are as follows:
Encodea* a* Encoding the message means to put information or thoughts into a language that
the receiver will understand.
Message and Feedback Messagea* a* The result or output of the encoding.
Mediuma* a* The method used to communicate, such as written, oral, or email.
Noisea* a* Anything that keeps the message from being either transmitted or understood.
Decodea* a* The receiver translates the information that was sent by the sender.
   The sender is responsible for encoding the message, selecting the medium, and decod-
ing the feedback message. The receiver is responsible for decoding the original message
from the sender and encoding and sending the feedback message. Figure 3.30 shows this
dynamic through the basic communication model.

                            message                    message




Communication Methods
Communication methods refer to how the project information is shared among the stake-
holders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are three classifications of communica-
tion methods:
Interactive Communicationa* a* Interactive communication involves multidirectional commu-
nication where two or more parties must exchange thoughts or ideas. This method includes
videoconferencing, phone or conference calls, and meetings.
Push Communicationsa* a* Push communications refers to sending information to intended
receivers. It includes methods such as letters, memos, reports, emails, voicemails, and
so on. This method assures that the communication was sent but is not concerned with
whether it was actually received or understood by the intended receivers.
Pull Communicationsa* a* The likely recipients of the information access the information
themselves using methods such as websites, e-learning sites, knowledge repositories, shared
network drives, and so on.


Meetings
Meetings are used by the project manager to facilitate conversations with the project team
on how project communications should occur throughout the life of the project. According
to the PMBOK(R) Guide, various types of meeting types can be used, many of which help
resolve issues and facilitate decisions.

Outputs of Plan Communications Management
The following two outputs result from carrying out the Plan Communications Management
process:
Communications Management Plan The communications management plan documents
the following:
    Types of information needs the stakeholders have
    When the information should be distributed
    How the information will be delivered
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the communications management plan typically
describes the following elements:
    The communication requirements of each stakeholder or stakeholder group
    Purpose for communication
    Frequency of communications, including time frames for distribution
    Name of the person responsible for communicating information
    Format of the communication and method of transmission
    Method for updating the communications management plan
    Glossary of common terms
The information that will be shared with stakeholders and the distribution methods are
based on the following items:
    Needs of the stakeholders
    Project complexity
    Organizational policies
Project Documents Updates       The following updates may be required as a result of per-
forming this process:
    Project schedule
    Stakeholder register


                 Don't forget that the Project Communications Management Knowledge Area has
                 two more processes: Manage Communications (a part of the Executing process
                 group) and Control Communications (a part of the Monitoring and Controlling
                 process group). Look for a discussion of these processes in Chapters 4 and 5.


exam essentials

Be able to describe the purpose of the communications management plan. The com-

Developing a Procurement
Management Plan
In many cases, some resources will need to be obtained externally (meaning outside of the
project's organization). When this is the case, a procurement management plan will be
needed. This plan is created out of the Plan Procurement Management process, which is
also responsible for producing other key procurement documents.
   The procurement management plan should be based on the project's scope and sched-
ule and is responsible for guiding the procurement-related processes and ensuring that the
required project resources will be available when and as needed.
   Plan Procurement Management is a process of identifying what goods or services will be
purchased from outside the organization. This process addresses the make-or-buy decision
and when acquired goods or services will be needed. By the end of this process, a procure-
ment management plan will have been created, make-or-buy decisions will have been made,
and a contract statement of work will have been drafted.
   Figure 3.31 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Procurement
Management process.

Inputs of Plan Procurement Management
You should be familiar with these inputs to the Plan Procurement Management process:
aOE   Project management plan
aOE   Requirements documentation
aOE   Risk register
aOE   Activity resource requirements
aOE   Project schedule
aOE   Activity cost estimates
aOE   Stakeholder register
aOE   Enterprise environmental factors
aOE   Organizational process assets
Project Management Plana* a* The Plan Procurement Management process uses the project
scope statement, which is included within the scope baseline. The scope baseline is part of
the project management plan.
Requirements Documentationa* a* The requirements documentation established the details
of the project requirements. For a more detailed description, see "Outputs of Collect
Requirements" earlier in this chapter.
Risk Registera* a* The risk register guides the project team in determining the types of ser-
vices or goods needed for risk management. It also identifies which procurement decisions
are driven as a result of a risk response, such as acquiring insurance or other services to
transfer liability to a third party.
Activity Resource Requirementsa* a* The availability of the assigned resources will impact the
procurement process and will aid in the make-or-buy decision.
Project Schedulea* a* The project schedule is necessary for determining the start and finish
dates of activities that will be completed through a third party.
Activity Cost Estimatesa* a* Activity cost estimates are necessary for determining the budget
allotted for completing project activities, which will influence make-or-buy decisions and
services or goods acquired.
Stakeholder Registera* a* The stakeholder register shows details on the participants in the
project and their interest in the outcomes.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Marketplace conditions are the key element of enter-
prise environmental factors used within this process. Other factors include products,
services, and results available in the marketplace; unique local requirements; and industry-
specific typical terms and conditions.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The organization's guidelines, policies, and procedures
(including any procurement policies and guidelines) are the elements of the organizational
164a*...      Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



process assets used in this process. Legal contractual relationships are another component
to organizational process assets for the Plan Procurement Management process. Contracts
will generally fall into two general categories: fixed-price or cost reimbursable.
A contract is a compulsory agreement between two or more parties and is used to acquire
products or services from outside the organization. Contracts are enforceable by law and
require an offer and an acceptance, with money typically exchanged for goods or services.
As reflected in Figure 3.32, there are different types of contracts for different purposes.

F i g u r e 3 . 3 2 a* a* Contract types


                     Fixed-price or    * Firm-fixed price (FFP)
                       lump-sum        * Fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF)
                        contracts      * Fixed-price with economic price adjustment (FP-EPA)



                   Cost-reimbursable   * Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)
                      or cost plus     * Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)
                       contracts       * Cost plus award fee (CPAF)



                      Time and
                                       * Cross between fixed-price contracts and cost-
                    material (T&M)
                                         reimbursable contracts
                      contracts



The PMBOK(R) Guide divides contracts into three categories:
    Fixed-Price, or Lump-Sum, Contractsa* a* Fixed-price contracts (also referred to as lump-
    sum contracts) can either set a specific, firm price for the goods or services rendered
    (known as a firm fixed-price contract) or can include incentives for meeting or exceeding
    certain contract deliverables. There are three types of fixed-price contracts:
     aOE   In a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract, the buyer and seller agree on a well-defined deliv-
           erable for a set price. In this kind of contract, the biggest risk is borne by the seller.
           The seller assumes the risks of increasing costs, nonperformance, or other problems.
     aOE   Fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF) contracts are another type of fixed-price contract.
           The difference is that the contract includes an incentive--or bonus--for early
           completion or for some other agreed-upon performance criterion that meets or
           exceeds contract specifications. Some of the risk is borne by the buyer as opposed
           to the firm fixed-price contract, where most of the risk is borne by the seller.
     aOE   A fixed-price with economic price adjustment (FP-EPA) contract allows for adjust-
           ments due to changes in economic conditions, like cost increases or decreases,
           inflation, and so on. These contracts are typically used when the project spans
           many years. This type of contract protects both the buyer and the seller from
           economic conditions that are outside of their control.

Cost-Reimbursable, or Cost Plus, Contracts With cost-reimbursable contracts, the
allowable costs associated with producing the goods or services are charged to the
buyer. All the costs the seller takes on during the project are charged back to the
buyer; thus, the seller is reimbursed. Cost-reimbursable contracts carry the highest risk
for the buyer because the total costs are uncertain and are used most often when the
project scope contains a lot of uncertainty or for projects that have large investments
early in the project life. The following list includes three types of cost-reimbursable
contracts:
    Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts charge back all allowable project costs
    to the seller and include a fixed fee upon completion of the contract. The fee
    is always firm in this kind of contract, but the costs are variable. The seller
    doesn't necessarily have a lot of motivation to control costs with this type of
    contract.
    Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) is the type of contract in which the buyer reim-
    burses the seller for the seller's allowable costs and includes an incentive for meet-
    ing or exceeding the performance criteria laid out in the contract. A possibility
    of shared savings between the seller and buyer exists if performance criteria are
    exceeded.
    Cost plus award fee (CPAF) is the riskiest of the cost plus contracts for the
    seller. In a CPAF contract, the seller will recoup all the costs expended dur-
    ing the project, but the award fee portion is subject to the sole discretion of the
    buyer.
Time and Material (T&M) Contracts T&M contracts are a cross between fi xed-
price and cost-reimbursable contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not
known at the time the contract is awarded. T&M contracts are most often used when
human resources with specific skills are needed and when the scope of work needed for
the project can be quickly defi ned. Time and material contracts include the following
characteristics:
    This type of contract resembles a cost-reimbursable contract because the costs will
    continue to grow during the contract's life and are reimbursable to the contractor.
    The buyer bears the biggest risk in this type of contract.
    This type of contract resembles fixed-price contracts when unit rates are used.
    Unit rates might be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the
    project.



              The project manager and the project team will be responsible for coordi-
              nating all the organizational interfaces for the project, including technical,
              human resource, purchasing, and finance.

Tools and Techniques of Plan Procurement Management
Know these four tools and techniques of the Plan Procurement Management process:
      Make-or-buy analysis
      Expert judgment
      Market research
      Meetings
Make-or-Buy Analysis Make-or-buy analysis is concerned with whether it is more cost-
effective to buy or lease the products and services or more cost-effective for the organiza-
tion to produce the goods and services needed for the project. Costs should include both
direct costs and indirect costs.
Other considerations in make-or-buy analysis are as follows:
      Capacity issues
      Skills
      Availability
      Trade secrets


                     Make-or-buy analysis is considered a general management technique and
                     concludes with the decision to do one or the other.


Expert Judgment       Expert judgment can be used within the Plan Procurement Management
process.
Market Research With market research, an examination is conducted of industry- and
vendor-specific capabilities. This effort can be conducted with information obtained at
industry conferences, by evaluating online reviews, and by using a variety of sources to
identify market capabilities.
Meetings As a complement to the effort of market research, meetings with potential bid-
ders may be conducted to help augment the interchange of information. This approach can
be mutually beneficial to both the purchaser and the supplier.


Outputs of Plan Procurement Management

aOE   Make-or-buy decisions
aOE   Change requests
aOE   Project documents update
Procurement Management Plana* a* The procurement management plan details how the
procurement process will be managed. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, it includes the
following information:
      aOE   Types of contracts to use
      aOE   Authority of the project team
      aOE   How the procurement process will be integrated with other project processes
      aOE   Where to find standard procurement documents (provided your organization uses
            standard documents)
      aOE   How many vendors or contractors are involved and how they'll be managed
      aOE   How the procurement process will be coordinated with other project processes,
            such as performance reporting and scheduling
      aOE   How the constraints and assumptions might be impacted by purchasing
      aOE   How multiple vendors or contractors will be managed
      aOE   Coordination of purchasing lead times with the development of the project schedule
      aOE   Schedule dates that are determined in each contract
      aOE   Identification of prequalified sellers (if known)
      aOE   Risk management issues
      aOE   Procurement metrics for managing contracts and for evaluating sellers
      aOE   Directions to sellers regarding the development and maintenance of the WBS
      aOE   Setting of the form and format of statements of work
      aOE   Selection of prequalified sellers to be used, if there are any
      aOE   Identification of procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts and evaluate
            sellers
   As with other plans, the procurement management plan can be highly detailed or
broadly stated, and can be formal or informal based on the needs of the project.
Procurement Statement of Worka* a* A procurement statement of work (SOW) contains
the details of the procurement item in clear, concise terms. It includes the following
elements:
      aOE   Project objectives
      aOE   Description of the work of the project and any post-project operational support
            needed
      aOE   Concise specifications of the product or services required
      aOE   Project schedule, time period of services, and work location
168a*...      Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



The procurement SOW is prepared by the buyer and is developed from the project scope
statement and the WBS and WBS dictionary. The seller uses the SOW to determine whether
they are able to produce the goods or services as specified. It will undergo progressive elab-
oration as the procurement processes occur.
Procurement Documentsa* a* Procurement documents are used to solicit vendors and suppli-
ers to bid on procurement needs. These documents are prepared by the buyer to assure as
accurate and complete a response as possible from all potential bidders. Examples of pro-
curement documents include the following:
aOE    Request for proposal (RFP)
aOE    Request for information (RFI)
aOE    Invitation for bid (IFB)
aOE    Request for quotation (RFQ)
Procurement documents typically include the following information:
aOE    Clear description of the work requested
aOE    Contract SOW
aOE    Explanation of how sellers should format and submit their responses
aOE    Any special provisions or contractual needs
The following words are used during the procurement process:
aOE    When the decision is going to be made primarily on price, the words bid and
       quotation are used, as in IFB or RFQ.
aOE    When considerations other than price (such as technology or specific approaches to the
       project) are the deciding factor, the word proposal is used, as in RFP.
Procurement documents are posted or advertised according to the buyer's organizational
policies. This might include ads in newspapers and magazines or ads/posts on the Internet.
Source Selection Criteriaa* a* The term source selection criteria refers to the method the
buyer's organization will use to choose a vendor from among the proposals received. The
criteria might be subjective or objective.
Here are some examples of criteria used:
aOE    Purchase price
aOE    Scoring models
aOE    Rating models
The following list includes some of the criteria for evaluating proposals and bids:
aOE    Comprehension and understanding of the needs of the project as documented in the
       contract SOW
aOE    Cost
aOE    Technical ability of the vendor and their proposed team
aOE    Technical approach

    Project management approach
    Management approach
    Financial stability and capacity
    Production capacity
    Reputation, references, and past performance
    Intellectual and proprietary rights
Make-or-Buy Decisions The make-or-buy decision is a document that outlines the deci-
sions made during the process regarding which goods and/or services will be produced by
the organization and which will be purchased. This can include any number of items:
    Services
    Products
    Insurance policies
    Performance
    Performance bonds
Change Requests As a result of going through this process, changes to the project man-
agement plan may be required due to vendor capability, availability, cost, quality consid-
erations, and so on. Change requests must be processed through the Perform Integrated
Change Control process.
Project Documents Updates According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the list of project docu-
ments that may be updated include but are not limited to
        Requirements documentation
        Requirements traceability matrix
        Risk register


                  Don't forget that the Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area
                  has three more processes: Conduct Procurements (a part of the Executing
                  process group), Control Procurements (a part of the Monitoring and Control-
                  ling process group), and Close Procurements (a part of the Closing process
                  group). Look for a discussion of these processes in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.



exam essentials

Be able to define the purpose of the Plan Procurement Management process. The pur-
pose of the Plan Procurement Management process is to identify which project needs
should be obtained from outside the organization. Make-or-buy analysis is used as a tool
and technique to help determine this.
170a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project




Be able to identify the contract types and their usage.a* a* Contract types are a tool
and technique of the Plan Procurement Management process and include fixed-price
and cost-reimbursable contracts. Use fixed-price contracts for well-defined projects
with a high value to the company, and use cost-reimbursable contracts for projects
with uncertainty and large investments early in the project life. The three types of
fixed-price contracts are FFP, FPIF, and FP-EPA. The three types of cost-reimbursable
contracts are CPFF, CPIF, and CPAF. Time and material contracts are a cross between
fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.

Be able to name the outputs of the Plan Procurement Management process.a* a* The
outputs of Plan Procurement Management are a procurement management plan,
procurement statement of work, procurement documents, source selection criteria,
make-or-buy decisions, change requests, and project documents updates.




Developing a Change Management Plan
Managing changes is important to successfully managing a project overall. Scope creep
is often the result of a poorly documented scope and poorly documented change control
procedures. To ensure that changes are managed appropriately, a change management plan
should be created. It should be noted that there isn't a formal documented process that cre-
ates this plan.
    The change management plan should document the following:
aOE    How changes will be monitored and controlled
aOE    Detailed processes for managing change to a project
aOE    How change requests are to be documented and managed
aOE    Process for approving changes
aOE    How to document and manage the final recommendation for the change requests



Developing a Risk Management Plan
The first official step in performing risk management is creating a risk management plan.
This is done by carrying out the Plan Risk Management process, which is the first official
process of the Project Risk Management Knowledge Area. Five of the six processes that fall
in this Knowledge Area belong to the Planning process group.
   The risk management plan is created to manage uncertainty throughout the project life
cycle, which allows the project management team to control the outcome of the project to
the extent possible. Like other plans, it plays an important role in guiding the rest of the
                                                 Developing a Risk Management Plan              171




processes that fall within its respective Knowledge Area. Without the risk management
plan, a project management team cannot effectively identify and manage risks because this
plan ensures that everyone is on the same page when it comes to assessing, prioritizing,
responding to, and managing risks.
   Aside from the Plan Risk Management process, the following risk-related processes
fall within the Planning process group: Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses. Remember that there is one
other process, Control Risks, which is a part of the Monitoring and Controlling process
group that we will cover in Chapter 5.


Plan Risk Management
The Plan Risk Management process determines how the project team will conduct risk
management activities. The risk management plan, which will be developed during this
process, guides the project team in carrying out the risk management processes and also
assures that the appropriate amount of resources and time is dedicated to risk management.
By the end of this process, the project team will have developed a common understanding
for evaluating risks throughout the remainder of the project.
   Figure 3.33 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Risk
Management process.

172a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Inputs of Plan Risk Management
You should know the following inputs of the Plan Risk Management process:
aOE    Project management plan
aOE    Project charter
aOE    Stakeholder register
aOE    Enterprise environmental factors
aOE    Organizational process assets
Project Management Plana* a* For the purposes of risk management planning, it is necessary
to consider all other approved subsidiary management plans and baselines. The project man-
agement plan sets the baseline for all risk-affected areas, especially scope, schedule, and cost.
Project Chartera* a* From the project charter, various inputs can be gleaned, including risks,
project descriptions, and requirements, all at a high level.
Stakeholder Registera* a* Using the stakeholder register will provide the details related to the
project stakeholder, including an overview of their roles.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* One of the key elements of the enterprise environmen-
tal factors to consider in this process is the risk tolerance levels of the organization and the
stakeholders. This is important for evaluating and ranking risk.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Organizational process assets include policies and guide-
lines that might already exist in the organization. The following should be considered when
developing the risk management plan:
aOE    Risk categories
aOE    Risk statement formats
aOE    Risk management templates tailored to the needs of the project
aOE    Defined roles and responsibilities
aOE    Authority levels of the stakeholders and project manager

Tools and Techniques of Plan Risk Management
The Plan Risk Management process has three tools and techniques: analytical techniques,
expert judgment, and meetings.
Analytical Techniquesa* a* To create and communicate the overall risk management context
of the project, analytical techniques are used. The risk management context combines the
strategic risk exposure of a given project with the stakeholders' attitude on risk. These
assessments will inform the project team on the appropriate resource allocation and allow
the team to focus on risk management activities.
Expert Judgmenta* a* In the creation of a comprehensive risk management plan, the judgment
and expertise should be considered from those with specialized training or knowledge in
the subject area including but not limited to
aOE    Senior management
aOE    Other project managers who have performed similar work efforts
                                            Developing a Risk Management Plana*...          173



aOE   Subject matter experts in the field
aOE   Project stakeholders
aOE   Industry groups and consultants
aOE   Technical and professional associations
Meetingsa* a* The purpose of the meetings is to contribute to the risk management plan.
During these meetings, the fundamental plans for performing risk management activities
will be discussed and determined and then documented in the risk management plan.

Outputs of Plan Risk Management
The output of the Plan Risk Management process is the risk management plan.
   The risk management plan describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks
throughout the project. It details how risk management processes will be implemented,
managed, monitored, and controlled.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the risk management plan should include the
following elements:
Methodologya* a* Methodology is a description of how you'll perform risk management,
including elements such as methods, tools, and where you might find risk data that you can
use in the later processes.
Roles and Responsibilitiesa* a* The risk management plan should include descriptions of the
people who are responsible for managing the identified risks and their responses and the people
responsible for each type of activity identified in the plan.
Budgetinga* a* The budget for risk management activities is included in the plan as well. In
this section, you'll assign resources and estimate the costs of risk management activities and
its methods. These costs are then included in the cost performance baseline.
Timinga* a* Timing refers to how often and at what point in the project life cycle risk
management processes will occur. You may also include protocols to establish contingency
schedule reserves.
Revised Stakeholder Tolerancesa* a* As the project proceeds through the risk manage-
ment processes, risk tolerances will change. These are documented in the risk man-
agement plan. Risk management should be carried out according to stakeholder risk
tolerances.
Reporting Formatsa* a* In the reporting formats section, you'll describe the content and for-
mat of the risk register. You should also detail how risk management information will be
maintained, updated, analyzed, and reported to project participants.
Trackinga* a* This includes a description of how you'll document the history of the risk
activities for the current project and how the risk processes will be audited.
Risk Categoriesa* a* Risk categories are a way of systematically identifying risks and provid-
ing a foundation for understanding. Risk categories should be identified during this process
and documented in the risk management plan.
174a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



There are multiple ways of displaying risk categories, such as through a simple list or by
constructing a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which lists the categories and subcatego-
ries. Figure 3.34 shows a sample of an RBS.

The following list includes some examples of the categories you might consider during this
process:
aOE    Technical/quality/performance risks
aOE    Project management risks
aOE    Organizational risks
aOE    External risks
Defining Probability and Impacta* a* The definitions for probability and impact are docu-
mented in the risk management plan as they relate to potential positive or negative risk
events and their impacts on project objectives.

aOE   Probability describes the potential for the risk event occurring.
aOE   Impact describes the effects or consequences the project will experience if the risk event
      occurs.
Probability and Impact Matrixa* a* A probability and impact matrix prioritizes the combina-
tion of probability and impact scores and helps determine which risks need detailed risk
response plans.


Identify Risks
The Identify Risks process describes all the risks that might impact the project and docu-
ments their characteristics in the risk register. Identify Risks is an iterative process that
continually builds on itself as additional risks emerge. The risk register is created at the
end of this process. The risk register documents all risk information, proposed responses,
responses implemented, and status.

                   Eighth Edition.


Inputs of Identify Risks
You should be familiar with the following inputs of the Identify Risks process:
      Risk management plan
      Cost management plan
      Schedule management plan
      Quality management plan
      Human resource management plan
      Scope baseline
      Activity cost estimates
      Activity duration estimates
      Stakeholder register
      Project documents
      Procurement documents
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
Risk Management Plan In this process, the roles and responsibilities section of the risk
management plan will be used, as well as the budget and schedule set aside for risk activities.
Cost Management Plan, Schedule Management Plan, Quality Management Plan, Human
Resource Management Plan, Project Documents An understanding of the project man-
agement plans and project documents is necessary for identifying risks. A thorough review
of these documents should be carried out to identify risks associated with them.
Scope Baseline The project scope statement, part of the scope baseline, contains a list of
project assumptions, which are issues believed to be true. The assumptions about delivery
times are reexamined, and it is determined if they are still valid.
Activity Cost Estimates Activity cost estimates may provide insight into the identification
of risks if the estimates are found to be insufficient to complete the activity.
Activity Duration Estimates Activity duration estimates may reveal existing risks in rela-
tion to the time that has been allotted for completing an activity or the project as a whole.
Stakeholder Register Understanding stakeholder influence is essential to risk management.
The stakeholder register provides a list of stakeholders and may list levels of influence.
Procurement Documents When a project requires the use of external procurement of
resources, procurement documents are an influential input to the Identify Risks process.

Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* The enterprise environmental factors include aspects
from outside the project that might help determine or influence project outcomes. Industry
information or academic research that might exist for your application areas regarding
risk information is especially relevant.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Historical information, such as from previous project
experiences and project team knowledge, is used from within the organizational process
assets. Risk register templates can also be used from past similar projects.


Tools and Techniques of Identify Risks
The Identify Risks process includes the following tools and techniques:
aOE   Documentation reviews
aOE   Information-gathering techniques
aOE   Checklist analysis
aOE   Assumptions analysis
aOE   Diagramming techniques
aOE   SWOT analysis
aOE   Expert judgment
Documentation Reviewsa* a* Documentation reviews involve reviewing project plans, assump-
tions, and historical information from previous projects from a total project perspective
as well as from an individual deliverables and activities level. This review helps the project
team identify risks associated with the project objectives.
Information-Gathering Techniquesa* a* The following information-gathering techniques are
used to assist in compiling a comprehensive list of risks:
aOE   Brainstorming
aOE   Delphi technique
aOE   Interviewing
aOE   Root cause analysis
Checklist Analysisa* a* Checklists used during the Identify Risks process are usually devel-
oped based on historical information and previous project team experience. The lowest
level of the RBS or a list of risks from previous similar projects may be used. The WBS can
also be used as a checklist.
Assumptions Analysisa* a* Assumptions analysis is a matter of validating the assump-
tions identified and documented during the course of the project planning processes.
Assumptions should be accurate, complete, and consistent. All assumptions are tested
against two factors:
aOE   Strength of the assumption or the validity of the assumption
aOE   Consequences that might impact the project if the assumption turns out to be false
178a*...      Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Diagramming Techniquesa* a* Three types of diagramming techniques are used in the Identify
Risks process:
    Cause-and-Effecta* a* Cause-and-effect diagrams show the relationship between the effects
    of problems and their causes. This diagram depicts every potential cause and subcause
    of a problem and the effect that each proposed solution will have on the problem. This
    diagram is also called a fishbone diagram or Ishikawa diagram after its developer, Kaoru
    Ishikawa. Figure 3.36 shows a sample cause-and-effect diagram.

    System of Process Flowchartsa* a* The system of process flowcharts shows the logical steps
    needed to accomplish an objective, how the elements of a system relate to each other,
    and which actions cause which responses. Figure 3.37 shows a flowchart to help deter-
    mine whether risk response plans should be developed for the risk.
    Influence Diagramminga* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, influence diagramming
    typically shows the causal influences among project variables, the timing or time order-
    ing of events, and the relationships among other project variables and their outcomes.
    Figure 3.38 shows an influence diagram for a product introduction decision.
SWOT Analysisa* a* Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis is a
technique that examines the project from each of these viewpoints and from the viewpoint
of the project itself. SWOT should also be used to examine project management processes,
resources, the organization, and so on to identify risks to the project, including risks that
are generated internally. SWOT analysis uncovers the following:
     aOE   Negative risks, which are typically associated with the organization's weaknesses
     aOE   Positive risks, which are typically associated with the organization's strengths
SWOT analysis also determines whether any of the organization's strengths can be used to
overcome its weaknesses.

Expert Judgment Experts for risk identification purposes can include individuals with the
following experience:
       Experience with similar projects
       Experience in the business area for which the project was undertaken
       Industry-specific experience
The bias of experts regarding the project or potential risk events should be considered when
using this technique.

Outputs of Identify Risks
There is only one output of the Identify Risks process: the risk register.


                     There will be other risk-related planning processes that will continue to
                     add information to the risk register.


      The risk register contains the following elements:
       List of identified risks
       List of potential responses
List of Identified Risks Risks are all the potential events and their subsequent conse-
quences that could occur as identified during this process. A list provides a means of
tracking risks and their occurrence and responses. The list should contain the following
items:
       All potential risks
       Tracking number
       Potential cause or event
       Potential impact
       Responses implemented
List of Potential Responses While you're identifying risks, you may identify a potential
response at the same time. If this is the case, these potential responses are documented.
      Table 3.7 shows a sample template for a risk register.


Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process involves determining what impact the iden-
tified risks will have on the project objectives and the probability that they will occur. It
also ranks the risks in priority order according to their effect on the project objectives. The
purpose of this process is to determine risk event probability and risk impact. By the end of
this process, updates will have been made to the risk register.

Inputs of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
Know the following inputs of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and how they apply:
     Risk management plan
182a*...      Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



aOE    Scope baseline
aOE    Risk register
aOE    Enterprise environmental factors
aOE    Organizational process assets
Risk Management Plana* a* The risk management plan documents the following, which are
used when prioritizing risks:
aOE    Roles and responsibilities of risk team members
aOE    Budget and schedule factors for risk activities
aOE    Stakeholder risk tolerances
aOE    Definitions for probability and impact
aOE    Probability and impact matrix
Scope Baselinea* a* Projects that have been attempted before will tend to have better
understood risks, whereas projects that are first-of-their-kind or are highly complex will
tend to be more uncertain. Through an examination of the scope baseline, these factors
will become clearer.
Risk Registera* a* The list of risks from within the risk register is used in this process.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* As with other processes that we have examined earlier,
enterprise environmental factors will provide insight and context to the risk assessment,
including studying industry projects of a similar nature and exploring risk databases that
may be available from industry or proprietary sources.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Historical information, lessons learned, and risk databases
from past projects are used from within the organizational process assets as a guide for
prioritizing the risks for this project.

Tools and Techniques of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
The following tools and techniques are used in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process:
aOE    Risk probability and impact assessment
aOE    Probability and impact matrix
aOE    Risk data quality assessment
aOE    Risk categorization
aOE    Risk urgency assessment
aOE    Expert judgment
Risk Probability and Impact Assessmenta* a* This tool and technique assesses the probability
that the risk events identified will occur and determines the effect (or impact) they have on
the project objectives:
      Probabilitya* a* Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur.

      Impacta* a* Impact is the amount of pain or gain that the risk event poses to the project.
      The following are two types of scales used to assign a value to risk:
       aOE   The risk impact scale, also known as an ordinal scale, can be a relative scale that
             assigns values such as high, medium, or low.
       aOE   Cardinal scale values are actual numeric values assigned to the risk impact.
             Cardinal scales are expressed as values from 0.0 to 1.0 and can be stated in equal
             (linear) or unequal (nonlinear) increments.
      Table 3.8 shows a typical risk impact scale for cost, time, and quality objectives based
      on a high-high to low-low scale.

                                                     to proceed




      Assessing Probability and Impacta* a* The idea behind both probability and impact values
      is to develop predefined measurements that describe which value to place on a risk event.
      Assumptions used to arrive at these determinations should also be documented in this
      process.
Probability and Impact Matrixa* a* The outcome of a probability and impact matrix is an
overall risk rating for each of the project's identified risks. The following are characteristics
of the probability and impact matrix:
aOE    The combination of probability and impact results in a classification usually expressed
       as high, medium, or low.
aOE    Values assigned to the risks determine how the Plan Risk Responses process is carried
       out for the risks later during the risk-planning processes.
184         Chapter 3        Planning the Project



      Values for the probability and impact matrix (and the probability and impact scales)
      are determined prior to the start of this process.
      The impact and probability matrix is documented in the risk management plan.


                      In several countries, it is common for high risks to be reflected as a red
                      condition within the probability and impact matrix, medium risks as a yel-
                      low condition, and low risks as a green condition. This type of ranking is
                      known as an ordinal scale because the values are ordered by rank from
                      high to low.


Risk Data Quality Assessment The risk data quality assessment involves determining the
usefulness of the data gathered to evaluate risk. The data must be unbiased and accurate.
Elements such as the following are used when performing this tool and technique:
      Quality of the data used
      Availability of data regarding the risks
      How well the risk is understood
      Reliability and integrity of the data
      Accuracy of the data
Risk Categorization        Risk categorization is used to determine the effects risk has on the
project.
Risk Urgency Assessment Risk urgency assessment determines how soon the potential
risks might occur and quickly determines responses for those risks that could occur in the
near term. The following play a role in determining how quickly a risk response is needed:
      Risk triggers
      Time to develop and implement a response
      Overall risk rating
Expert Judgment Expert judgment is used to determine the probability, impact, and other
information derived to date from this process. Interviews and facilitated workshops are two
techniques used in conjunction with expert judgment to perform this process.

Outputs of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
The output of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process delivers project documents
updates, including updates to the risk register and assumptions log.
  According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the risk register will receive the following updates,
which are added as new entries:
      Risk ranking (or priority) for the identified risks
      Risks grouped by categories
      Causes of risk
                                                       Developing a Risk Management Plana*...           185



aOE       List of risks requiring near-term responses
aOE       List of risks that need additional analysis and response
aOE       Watch list of low-priority risks
aOE       Trends in qualitative risk analysis results
   The assumptions log will receive updates as new information is made available through
the qualitative risk assessment. Assumptions could be incorporated in the project scope
statement or in a separate log.


Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized
during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for the
project by assigning numeric probabilities to each risk and determining their impacts on
project objectives. The purpose of this process is to perform the following:
aOE       Quantify the project's possible outcomes and probabilities.
aOE       Determine the probability of achieving the project objectives.
aOE       Identify risks that need the most attention by quantifying their contribution to overall
          project risk.
aOE       Identify realistic and achievable schedule, cost, or scope targets.
aOE       Determine the best project management decisions possible when outcomes are uncertain.

      Risk management plan
      Cost management plan
      Schedule management plan
      Risk register
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
Risk Management Plan The risk management plan guides the project team in carrying
out the risk processes. The following key elements are used from within the risk manage-
ment plan:
      Roles and responsibilities
      Risk management activities
      Guidelines for setting aside contingency reserves
      RBS
      Stakeholder tolerances
Cost Management Plan The cost management plan provides the necessary information to
address cost-related risks so that the project can be kept within budget.
Schedule Management Plan The schedule management plan provides the necessary infor-
mation to address schedule-related risks so that the project can be kept on schedule.
Risk Register The risk register contains a list of identified risks as well as any other docu-
mented information on risks to date.
Enterprise Environmental Factors Enterprise environmental factors contribute insight and
context to the risk analysis. Two factors to consider are industry studies of similar projects
that are conducted by risk specialists, and a review of risk databases available from the
industry or through proprietary sources.
Organizational Process Assets The organizational process assets include historical infor-
mation from previous projects.

aOE         Expert judgment

Data-Gathering and Representation Techniquesa* a* Data-gathering and representative tech-
niques are as follows:
      Interviewinga* a* Project team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are typi-
      cal interview subjects. Oftentimes, three-point estimates are gathered from the experts
      to quantify the probability and impact of risks on project objectives. The following
      interview topics are common:
      aOE      Experiences on past projects
      aOE      Experiences working with the types of technology or processes used during this
               project

      Probability Distributionsa* a* Continuous probability distributions (particularly beta
      and triangular distributions) are commonly used in Perform Quantitative Risk
      Analysis. According to the PMBOKaoe(R) Guide, the following probability distributions
      are often used:
      aOE      Normal and lognormal
      aOE      Triangular
      aOE      Beta
      aOE      Uniform distributions
      aOE      Discrete distributions
      Distributions are graphically displayed and represent both the probability and time or
      cost elements.
Quantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniquesa* a* One or more of the following quan-
titative risk analysis and modeling techniques are used:
      Sensitivity Analysisa* a* Sensitivity analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing the
      potential impact of risk events on the project and determining which risk event (or
      events) has the greatest potential for impact by examining all the uncertain elements at
      their baseline values. Figure 3.41 shows a sample tornado diagram, which is one of the
      ways that sensitivity analysis data can be displayed.
      Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysisa* a* Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis
      is a statistical technique that calculates the average, anticipated future impact of the
      decision. EMV is calculated by multiplying the probability of the risk by its impact and
      then adding them together:
      aOE      Positive results generally indicate an opportunity within the project.
      aOE      Negative results generally indicate a threat to the project.

    EMV is used in conjunction with the decision tree analysis technique. Decision trees
    are diagrams that show the sequence of interrelated decisions and the expected results
    of choosing one alternative over the other. Typically, more than one choice or option is
    available in response to a decision. The available choices are depicted in tree form, start-
    ing at the left with the risk decision branching out to the right with possible outcomes.
    Decision trees are usually used for risk events associated with time or cost. Figure 3.42
    shows a sample decision tree using EMV as one of its inputs.

    Modeling and Simulationa* a* Modeling and simulation techniques are often used for
    schedule risk analysis and cost analysis. Simulation techniques compute the project
    model using various inputs, such as cost or schedule duration, to determine a probability
    distribution for the variable chosen. Modeling and simulation techniques examine the
    identified risks and their potential impacts to the project objectives from the perspective
    of the whole project.
                                               Developing a Risk Management Plana*...            189




      Monte Carlo analysis is an example of a simulation technique. It is replicated many
      times, typically using cost or schedule variables. Every time the analysis is performed,
      the values for the variable are changed with the output plotted as a probability distribu-
      tion. This type of information helps the risk management team determine the probability
      of completing the project on time and/or within budget.
Expert Judgmenta* a* Experts can come from inside or outside the organization and should
have experience that's applicable to the project. When performing quantitative risk analy-
sis, experts can also assist in validating the data and tools used.

Outputs of Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
Like the process before it, the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process contains one out-
put, project documents updates, including the risk register.
   The following risk register updates occur as a result of this process:
aOE    Probabilistic analysis of the project
aOE    Probability of achieving the cost and time objectives
aOE    Prioritized list of quantified risks
aOE    Trends in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis results
Probabilistic Analysis of the Projecta* a* Probabilistic analysis of the project is the forecasted
results of the project schedule and costs as determined by the outcomes of risk analysis. The
following are characteristics of probabilistic analysis:
aOE    Results include projected completion dates and costs along with a confidence level
       associated with each.
aOE    The output is often expressed as a cumulative distribution.
aOE    Results are used along with stakeholder risk tolerances to quantify the time and cost
       contingency reserves.
Probability of Achieving the Cost and Time Objectivesa* a* The probability of achieving the
cost and time objectives of the project are documented based on the results of performing
the quantitative risk analysis tools and techniques.
Prioritized List of Quantified Risksa* a* The prioritized list of risks includes the following
items:
aOE    Risks with the greatest risk or threat to the project
aOE    Risk impacts
aOE    Risks that present the greatest opportunities to the project
aOE    Risks that are most likely to impact the critical path
aOE    Risks with the largest cost contingency
Trends in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Resultsa* a* Trends in Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis appear as the process is repeated. Trends are documented for further analysis
and for use in developing risk response plans.

Plan Risk Responses
Plan Risk Responses is a process of deciding what actions to take to reduce threats and
take advantage of the opportunities discovered during the risk analysis processes. This
includes assigning resources the responsibility of carrying out risk response plans outlined
in this process. By the end of this process, the risk register will be updated to include a risk
response plan for all risks that require some form of action.
   Figure 3.43 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Risk
Responses process.

Inputs of Plan Risk Responses
The Plan Risk Responses process contains two inputs that you should be familiar with. Be
sure you know how they are used during the process.
Risk Management Plan The following are used from within the risk management plan in
carrying out this process:
      Roles and responsibilities that pertain to risk
      Definitions of risk analysis
      Risk thresholds
      Time and budget requirements allotted for risk activities
Risk Register All of the information included within the risk register to date will be used
in developing risk responses.
                                                          Developing a Risk Management Plana*...   191




Tools and Techniques of Plan Risk Responses
Tools and techniques of the Plan Risk Responses process that you should know are as
follows:
aOE         Strategies for negative risks or threats
aOE         Strategies for positive risks or opportunities
aOE         Contingent response strategies
aOE         Expert judgment
Strategies for Negative Risks or Threatsa* a* As Figure 3.44 shows, strategies for negative
risks or threats include avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept.

F i g u r e 3 . 4 4 a* a* Strategies for negative risks

                                             * Avoid
                            Strategies for   * Transfer
                            negative risks   * Mitigate
                                             * Accept



      Avoida* a* To avoid a risk means to evade it altogether, eliminate the cause of the risk
      event, or change the project plan to protect the project objectives from the risk event.
      Here are some examples of avoiding risk:
      aOE      Improving communications
      aOE      Refining requirements
      aOE      Assigning additional resources to project activities
      aOE      Refining the project scope to avoid risk events
      Transfera* a* The purpose of risk transfer is to transfer a risk and its consequences to a
      third party. This strategy will impact the project budget.
      Here are some examples of transferring risk:
      aOE      Insurance
      aOE      Contracting
      aOE      Warranties
      aOE      Guarantees
      aOE      Performance bonds
      Mitigatea* a* To mitigate a risk means to reduce the probability of a risk event and its
      impacts to an acceptable level. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the purpose of mitiga-
      tion is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and reduce the impact of the risk
      to an acceptable level.
      Accepta* a* The acceptance strategy is used when the project team isn't able to eliminate
      all the threats to the project. Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that can be used
192a*...          Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



      for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project. There are two forms of
      acceptance:
      aOE      Passive acceptance occurs when the project team has assessed the risk as low
               enough in probability and/or impact that they choose to do no additional planning
               for that potential event at this time.
      aOE      Active acceptance includes developing contingency reserves to deal with risks should
               they occur.
Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunitiesa* a* Strategies for positive risks or opportuni-
ties, as shown in Figure 3.45, include exploit, share, enhance, and accept.

F i g u r e 3 . 4 5 a* a* Strategies for positive risks

                                            * Exploit
                           Strategies for   * Share
                           positive risks   * Enhance
                                            * Accept



      Exploita* a* Exploiting a risk event is to look for opportunities for positive impacts. This
      is the strategy of choice when positive risks have been identified and the project team
      wants to make certain the risk will occur within the project. An example of exploiting a
      risk would be reducing the amount of time to complete the project by bringing on more
      qualified resources.
      Sharea* a* The share strategy is similar to transferring because risk is assigned to a third-
      party owner who is best able to bring about the opportunity the risk event presents. An
      example of sharing a risk would be a joint venture.
      Enhancea* a* The enhance strategy involves closely watching the probability or impact of
      the risk event to assure that the organization realizes the benefits. This entails watch-
      ing for and emphasizing risk triggers and identifying the root causes of the risk to help
      enhance impacts or probability.
      Accepta* a* This is similar to the accept strategies used for negative risks or threats.
Contingent Response Strategiesa* a* Contingent response strategies, also known as contin-
gency planning, involves planning alternatives to deal with the risks should they occur.
Contingency planning recognizes that risks may occur and that plans should be in place to
deal with them.
The following contingency responses are common:
aOE         Contingency reserves, which include project funds that are held in reserve to offset any
            unavoidable threats that might occur to project scope, schedule, cost, or quality. Also
            includes reserving time and resources to account for risks.
aOE         Fallback plans, which are developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identi-
            fied strategies that might not be the most effective at dealing with the risk.
                                             Developing a Risk Management Plana*...            193




Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment is used in developing risk responses, including feed-
back and guidance from risk management experts and those internal to the project quali-
fied to provide assistance in this process.


Outputs of Plan Risk Responses
Here are the two outputs of the Plan Risk Responses process:
aOE   Project management plan updates
aOE   Project documents updates
Project Management Plan Updatesa* a* The following documents within the project manage-
ment plan may require updates to reflect the changes in process and practice that are driven
by the risk responses:
aOE   Any and all of the management plans, including the schedule management plan, cost
      management plan, quality management plan, procurement management plan, and
      human resource management plan
aOE   Any and all of the project baselines, including the scope baseline, schedule baseline,
      and cost baseline
Project Documents Updatesa* a* There are several project document updates, with the key update
occurring to the risk register. Elements to the risk register can include but are not limited to
aOE   List of identified risks, including their descriptions, what WBS element they impact (or
      area of the project), categories (RBS), root causes, and how the risks impact the project
      objectives
aOE   Risk owners and their responsibility
aOE   Outputs from the Perform Qualitative Analysis process
aOE   Agreed-upon response strategies
aOE   Actions needed to implement response plans
aOE   Risk triggers
aOE   Cost and schedule activities needed to implement risk responses
aOE   Contingency plans
aOE   Fallback plans, which are risk response plans that are executed when the initial risk
      response plan proves to be ineffective
aOE   Contingency reserves
aOE   Residual risk, which is a leftover risk that remains after the risk response strategy has
      been implemented
aOE   Secondary risks, which are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk
      response
Other project documents, such as technical documentation and the assumptions docu-
mented in the project scope statement, may require an update after performing this process.
194        Chapter 3      Planning the Project




                  Don't forget that the Project Risk Management Knowledge Area has
                  one more process: Control Risks. Look for a discussion of this process
                  in Chapter 5 when we discuss the Monitor and Controlling process
                  group.




exam essentials

Be able to define the purpose of the risk management plan. The risk management
plan describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. It
details how risk management processes (including Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Control
Risks) will be implemented, monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project.
It describes how you will manage risks but does not attempt to define responses to
individual risks.

Be able to define the purpose of the Identify Risks process. The purpose of the Identify
Risks process is to identify all risks that might impact the project, document them, and
identify their characteristics.

Be able to define the risk register and some of its primary elements. The risk register is
an output of the Identify Risks process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output
of every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Plan Risk Responses process,
the risk register contains these primary elements: identified list of risks, risk owners, risk
triggers, risk strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves.

Be able to define the purpose of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Perform
Qualitative Risk Analysis determines the impact the identified risks will have on the proj-
ect and the probability they'll occur, and it puts the risks in priority order according to
their effects on the project objectives.

Be able to define the purpose of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
process. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis evaluates the impacts of risks prioritized
during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for
the project by assigning numeric probabilities to each risk and determining their impact
on project objectives.

Be able to define the purpose of the Plan Risk Responses process. Plan Risk Responses
is the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as avoid,
transfer, mitigate, accept, exploit, share, enhance, develop contingent response strate-
gies, and apply expert judgment. The risk response plan describes the actions to take
should the identified risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of
the risks, how they'll impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage
the risk responses.
                                         Developing a Stakeholder Management Plan          195




Developing a Stakeholder
Management Plan
The primary reason that a project is undertaken is to satisfy the expectations of the project
stakeholders. Clearly, it is important to ensure efforts are made to identify, work with, and
communicate with the appropriate stakeholders. Within the Planning process group, the
Plan Stakeholder Management process is the key work effort for the Project Stakeholder
Management Knowledge Area.
   Figure 3.46 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Plan Stakeholder
Management process.

Inputs of Plan Stakeholder Management
Know the following inputs of the Plan Stakeholder Management process:
    Project management plan
    Stakeholder register
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
196a*...     Chapter 3a*  a* Planning the Project



Project Management Plan a* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, to develop the stakeholder
management plan you can use the following information from the project management plan:
aOE    Life cycle and processes that will be applied to each phase of the project
aOE    Explanation of how the work will be executed to accomplish project objectives
aOE    Description of the human resources needed, addressing roles and responsibilities,
       reporting relationships, and staffing
aOE    Change management plan illustrating how changes will be controlled
aOE    Need and techniques for communication among stakeholders
Stakeholder Register a* a* Information that is needed to plan engagement with project stake-
holders is provided from the stakeholder register.
Enterprise Environmental Factors a* a* All enterprise environmental factors can be used
within the Plan Stakeholder Management process. Special attention should be given to the
organizational structure and culture as well as external stakeholder requirements. It will be
important to adapt the management of stakeholders to the project environment.
Organizational Process Assets a* a* The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that all the elements described
in the enterprise environmental factors can be used in this process. Particular consideration
should be given to lessons learned and historical information.


Tools and Techniques of Plan Stakeholder Management
The Plan Stakeholder Management process includes the following tools and techniques:
aOE    Expert judgment
aOE    Meetings
aOE    Analytical techniques
Expert Judgment a* a* Using the project objectives as a guide, a project manager should apply
expert judgment when considering the level of engagement required for each stakeholder. It
may be necessary to adjust the level of engagement considering the different phases of the
project. In the creation of the stakeholder management plan, a project manager can look
to the following groups depending on specialized training or subject matter expertise these
individuals might possess. They include
aOE    Senior management and other identified key stakeholders
aOE    Project team members
aOE    Other functional units or individuals
aOE    Project managers who have completed similar projects
aOE    Subject matter experts in the business or project areas
aOE    Industry groups and consultants
aOE    Professional and technical associations

Meetings a* a* The stakeholder management strategy defines the level of participation needed
for each stakeholder.
Analytical Techniques a* a* The current engagement level of all stakeholders should be
compared to the planned levels of engagement to ensure project success. This is a critical
process that needs to be performed throughout the life cycle of the project to help ensure
satisfied stakeholders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the level of engagement with
stakeholders can be classified as follows:
aOE   Unaware, where the stakeholder is unaware of the project and potential impacts
aOE   Resistant, where the stakeholder is aware of the project but is resistant to change
aOE   Neutral, where the stakeholder is aware but is neither supportive nor resistant
aOE   Supportive, where the stakeholder is aware of the project and is supportive of
      change
aOE   Leading, where the stakeholder is actively engaged in ensuring the project is a
      success.
   Table 3.9 shows how current engagement can be documented using the Stakeholders
Engagement Assessment Matrix, where C indicates the current level of engagement and D
indicates the desired level of engagement.

                   Remember that the Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area has
                   three additional processes: Identify Stakeholders, a part of the Chapter 2
                   discussion of the Initiating process group; Manage Stakeholder Engage-
                   ment, which will be covered in Chapter 4 as part of the Executing process
                   group; and Control Stakeholder Engagement. Look for a discussion of this
                   last process in Chapter 5 when we discuss the Monitor and Controlling
                   process group.

Obtaining Project Management
Plan Approval
With the subsidiary plans and baselines created, it's time to bring them all together into a
project management plan. The project management plan consists of a compilation of these
plans and baselines and is an output of the Develop Project Management Plan process. This
primary plan is presented to key stakeholders for sign-off (if required). Once it's approved,
the team can move forward to execute the plan.
   Develop Project Management Plan is the fi rst process in the Planning process group,
and it's part of the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area. This process defi nes,

coordinates, and integrates all the various subsidiary project plans and baselines. The result
is a project management plan document that describes how the project outcomes will be
executed, monitored, and controlled as the project progresses and how the project will be
closed out once it concludes.
    Throughout the project, the project management plan will be updated to reflect
approved project changes. It will be used as an input to many of the project management
processes, and as a result of approved changes, it will also become an output of several
processes.
    Figure 3.47 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Develop Project
Management Plan process.

Outputs from Other Processesa* a* Outputs from other project management processes may be
used to develop the project management plan. In particular, the following outputs from the
planning processes may be helpful inputs to develop the project management plan:
aOE   Any processes used that produce a baseline
aOE   Any processes that produce a subsidiary management plan
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* The following key elements of the environmental fac-
tors should be considered when choosing the processes to perform for this project:
aOE   Standards and regulations (both industry and governmental)
aOE   Company culture and organizational structure
aOE   Personnel administration
aOE   Project management information system (PMIS)
The PMIS is an automated or manual system used to document the subsidiary plans
and the project management plan, facilitate the feedback process, and revise the
documents.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The following key elements of the organizational process
assets should be considered within this process:
aOE   Project management plan template
aOE   Change control procedures
aOE   Historical information
aOE   Configuration management knowledge database that contains the official company
      policies, standards, procedures, and other project documents


Tools and Techniques of Develop Project
Management Plan
Expert judgment and facilitation techniques are the only tools and techniques of the
Develop Project Management Plan process.
  The following types of expert judgment are needed to complete this process:
aOE   Tailoring techniques
aOE   Understanding technical and management details that need to be included in the proj-
      ect management plan
aOE   Determining resources and assessing skill levels needed for project work
aOE   Determining and defining the amount of configuration management to apply on the
      project

Output of Develop Project Management Plan
The output of the Develop Project Management Plan process is the project management plan.

                   The purpose of most processes is to produce an output. Outputs are usu-
                   ally a report or document of some type, a deliverable, or an update to a set
                   of documents.

   The project management plan includes the following elements:
    Processes used to perform each phase of the project
    Life cycle used for the project and for each phase of the project when applicable
    Tailoring of results the project team defines
    Methods for executing the work of the project to fulfill the objectives
    Change management plan describing methods for monitoring and controlling change
    Configuration management
    Methods for determining and maintaining the validity of performance baselines
    Communication needs of the stakeholders and techniques to fulfill those needs
    Management reviews of content, issues, and pending decisions
   The project management plan also contains multiple subsidiary plans and baselines, as
described in Table 3.10. Figure 3.48 depicts a high-level view of the contents that make up the plan.

                 Subsidiary and component plans may be detailed or simply a synopsis,
                 depending on the project needs. As the project progresses and more and
                 more processes are performed, the subsidiary plans and the project man-
                 agement plan itself may change.



exam essentials

Be able to state the purpose of the Develop Project Management Plan process. The
project management plan defines how the project is executed, monitored and controlled,
and closed, and it documents the processes used during the project.




Conducting a Kickoff Meeting
A kickoff meeting typically occurs at the end of the planning process, prior to beginning
the project work. The purpose of the kickoff meeting is to ensure that everyone is aware
of the project details and their role within the project and to announce that the project
work is ready to begin. This is a great opportunity to review project milestones and other
important information with key stakeholders.

Meeting Attendees
Those who attend a kickoff meeting include, but are not limited to, the following
individuals:
    Project manager
    Project team members
    Customer
    Project sponsor
    Department managers
    Other key stakeholders


Meeting Topics
The topics discussed within a kickoff meeting include, but are not limited to, the
following:
    Introductions of attendees
    Meeting agenda
    Review of the project management plan

Bringing the Processes Together
This chapter covered a tremendous amount of information; the Planning process group is
the largest project management process group. In addition to understanding each process
individually, you'll need to know how the processes work together. Understanding that big-
ger picture will help you with situational exam questions as well as using the project man-
agement processes in a real-world setting.
    Now that you have a strong grasp of how the outputs from various processes become
the inputs for other processes, you understand why some processes must occur before oth-
ers can move forward. For example, to create the project management plan, the results of
the Initiating process group are required. Figure 3.49 shows this interaction between the
Initiating process group and the Planning process group, the first two stages of the project's
life cycle. The relationship between the project management plan and the rest of the plan-
ning processes is just as interactive, if not more dynamic.

   The project management plan is used in Planning processes across nine of the ten
Knowledge Areas. (The remaining Knowledge Area generates the project management
plan.) The results of these planning processes are fed back into the project management
plan as updates. The updates might, in turn, impact several of the other planning pro-
cesses. For example, the project management plan contains the cost management plan.
Any changes that are approved in the cost management plan become updates to the project
management plan. As a result, these approved and updated changes could impact other
planning processes that might also require that updates and changes be made.
   By now, it should be clear that the project management plan is the heart of the proj-
ect and that much of the project's success can be based on the processes of the Planning
process group. A common motto in the project management industry is, "A well-planned
project makes for a successful project." Figure 3.50 illustrates how the project management
plan remains at the center of the Planning process group.

  In summary, the project management plan is a compilation of several subsidiary plans
and baselines:
aOE   Change management plan
aOE   Communications management plan
aOE   Configuration management plan
aOE   Cost management plan
aOE   Cost baseline
aOE   Human resource management plan
aOE   Process improvement plan

   The change management plan, which was not previously addressed, describes how you
will document and manage change requests, the process for approving changes, and how
to document and manage the final recommendation for the change requests. Configuration
management changes deal with the components of the product of the project, such as func-
tional ability or physical attributes, rather than the project process itself.
   Scope is also a critical element within planning because it defines the boundaries of the
project and what it is that the project has set out to achieve. As shown in Figure 3.47, the project
schedule and the project budget are part of the project's foundation. These project elements play
a big role in measuring and monitoring the progress of the project. The resources and purchased
services and/or products complete the project's foundation. Without the human resources, as
well as the external project teams, the project could not move forward.
   Guiding the project from above are communications management, quality management,
and risk management--all critical elements of the project that influence and guide the proj-
ect toward success. As you can see, all of these project elements are intertwined and build
on one another.
   With this big picture in mind, let's go back and review what you've learned thus far
about each of the project management Knowledge Areas. You'll find that what goes on
within each Knowledge Area is connected on a high level and is structured in a logical
format.


Project Scope Management Knowledge Area Review
You may recall that the project scope defines the work to be completed during the project,
providing the project with boundaries. Figure 3.51 illustrates the process and inputs used to
create the work breakdown structure. (Remember that the WBS is a decomposition of the
project deliverables, down to the work package level.) The WBS becomes part of the scope
baseline, as is the project scope statement and the WBS dictionary. The scope baseline is
necessary input for activities in the next Knowledge Area, Project Time Management.

Project Time Management Knowledge Area Review
Figure 3.52 reflects, step by step, how the project schedule is developed. The planning
process flow within the Project Time Management Knowledge Area is extremely clear. It's
important to understand the following points:
aOE   The scope baseline is central to creating the initial list of project activities; creating the
      list is the first step toward developing the project schedule.
aOE   The project budget can influence the number and type of resources the project can use.
aOE   Clearly defining the resources needed to carry out the project activities is key to plan-

Project Cost Management Knowledge Area Review
Figure 3.53 shows the key process steps for creating the project budget. The scope baseline is nec-
essary for determining estimates for the cost of each activity. The cost management plan comes
into play and governs how the activity costs are estimated and how the project budget is created.

Project Quality Management Knowledge Area Review
The single planning step within the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area results
in several key items in the quality management processes. Figure 3.54 shows how the
information resulting from scope, cost, time, and risk planning processes is necessary for
carefully planning project quality. This first step in defining project quality produces the
following:
aOE   Method for planning, carrying out, and controlling quality activities
aOE   Metrics used to measure project quality
aOE   Method the project management team can use to approach and then carry out a
      process improvement strategy

Project Human Resource Management
Knowledge Area Review
Figure 3.55 depicts the only planning process within the Project Human Resource
Management Knowledge Area. Key to this first process of the Knowledge Area is develop-
ing the human resource management plan, which will guide the rest of the processes relat-
ing to human resources, including hiring, developing, and managing the project team.


Project Communications Management
Knowledge Area Review
As you learned in this chapter, meeting stakeholder needs, requirements, and expecta-
tions is essential to a successful project. Project communications play a big role in meeting

these objectives. Figure 3.56 depicts the only planning-related step within the Project
Communications Management Knowledge Area. This step determines how project com-
munications will be managed and defines stakeholder communication requirements. The
result is the communications management plan. To define the communication needs and
requirements of stakeholders, you need the following result of the Initiating process group:

Project Risk Management Knowledge Area Review
Risk management planning begins as early as the project begins. The first step, which cre-
ates the risk management plan, is carried through early on during the planning phase of the
project. Project plans, such as the cost management plan, the schedule management plan,
and the communications management plan, are used to develop the risk management plan.
The project scope statement is also used.
   As depicted in Figure 3.57, the steps within risk management planning are very intuitive.
First, you plan how to manage, assess, and deal with risks. Then, you identify and priori-
tize the identified risks. Analyzing the risks comes next. As you may recall, this can include
qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk analysis.

   With the existing information at hand, you can now plan how you will respond to
risks that call for action. As you can see in Figure 3.57, the risk register is a living docu-
ment, updated throughout the project as risks are identified. It documents all of the
information about these risks and is therefore continuously updated as the processes are
carried out.


Project Procurement Management
Knowledge Area Review
Figure 3.58 shows the single procurement-planning step. Here you plan how
procurements will be carried out and managed within the project. This activity also
determines which products or services will be procured. A total of nine inputs feed
the process.

Project Stakeholder Management
Knowledge Area Review
The Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area is concerned with identifying all of
the stakeholders associated with the project, both internal and external to the organiza-
tion. These processes also assess stakeholder needs, expectations, and involvement on the
project and seek to keep the lines of communication with stakeholders open and clear. The
definition of a successful project is one where the stakeholders are satisfied. These processes
assure that stakeholder expectations are met and that their satisfaction is a successful deliv-
erable of the project. Figure 3.59 depicts the only planning step in the Project Stakeholder
Management Knowledge Area.
   As you can see, the planning processes within each Knowledge Area are highly inter-
active. The processes interact not just within their own respective Knowledge Areas, but
among the other planning processes.

   Each project carries different needs, and not all of the processes will be necessary for
every project. We previously touched on the fact that some processes can be combined to
tailor management for a particular project to the needs of that individual project. But, as
you've also seen, some process outputs are critical as inputs to other processes. The project
management plan, which lies at the core of the Planning process group, is one of those criti-
cal outputs.

          Executing the Project performance
          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

          aoefi Acquire and manage project resources by following the
                human resource and procurement management plans in
                order to meet project requirements.

          aoefi Manage task execution based on the project management
                plan by leading and developing the project team in order
                to achieve project deliverables.

          aoefi Implement the quality management plan using the appro-
                priate tools and techniques in order to ensure that work
                is being performed in accordance with required quality
                standards.

          aoefi Implement approved changes and corrective actions by
                following the change management plan in order to meet
                project requirements.

          aoefi Implement approved actions by following the risk man-
                agement plan in order to minimize the impact of risks and
                take advantage of opportunities on the project.

          aoefi Manage the flow of information by following the commu-
                nications plan in order to keep stakeholders engaged and
                informed.

          aoefi Maintain stakeholder relationships by following the stake-
                holder management plan in order to receive continued
                support and manage expectations.
                                 Executing is the third process group of the five project
                                 management process groups. The processes in this group are
                                 responsible for executing the work outlined in the project
management plan, managing the project resources, and performing the work of the project.
Within this process group, you will also see approved changes and actions implemented as
well as replanning and rebaselining as a result of implemented changes.
     Executing also involves keeping the project in line with the original plan. The majority
of the project budget and time will be spent in this process group, and the majority of con-
fl icts will relate to the schedule. In addition, the product description will be fi nalized and
contain more detail than it did in the planning processes.
     The Executing process group accounts for 31 percent of the questions on the Project
Management Professional (PMP(R)) exam.


                  The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and descrip-
                  tions of the project management process groups and related materials
                  and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide to the
                  Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide), Fifth Edition
                  (PMI (R), 2013).




Obtaining and Managing Resources
As mentioned previously, the Executing process group involves performing the project
work. Naturally, this cannot be accomplished without fi rst acquiring the resources
needed to perform the project work. Obtaining resources occurs through the Acquire
Project Team process (which is part of the Project Human Resource Management
Knowledge Area) and the Conduct Procurements process (which is a part of the Project
Procurement Management Knowledge Area). The human resource and procurement
management plans play an important role in carrying out these processes because they
outline how resources will be acquired, managed, and released throughout the project
life cycle.


Acquire Project Team
The Acquire Project Team process involves acquiring and assigning human resources, both
internal and external, to the project. It is the project manager's responsibility to ensure that
                                                    Obtaining and Managing Resources                  219




resources are available and skilled in the project activities to which they're assigned. This
process considers the following factors:
    The process of negotiation with individuals who can provide the needed human
    resources
    The consequences of not obtaining the human resources
    Alternative resources should the planned resources not be available as a result of cir-
    cumstances out of the project manager's control

Team process.

The staffing management plan should detail how the team will be acquired.
Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* The enterprise environmental factors used in this pro-
cess involve taking the following information into account before making assignments:
aOE   Personal interests
aOE   Cost rates
aOE   Prior experience
aOE   Availability and information of potential team members
aOE   Personnel administration policies
aOE   Organizational structure
aOE   Locations
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The organizational process assets input refers to the stan-
dard processes, policies, procedures, and guidelines that the organization has in place. This
includes policies related to acquiring external resources. In particular, recruitment practices
should be taken into account.


Tools and Techniques of Acquire Project Team
Be familiar with the following tools and techniques of the Acquire Project Team process:
aOE   Preassignment
aOE   Negotiation
aOE   Acquisition
aOE   Virtual teams
aOE   Multicriteria decision analysis

Preassignmenta* a* Preassignment may take place when the project is put out for bid and
specific team members are promised as part of the proposal or when internal project team
members are promised and assigned as a condition of the project. Preassignments are docu-
mented within the project charter.
Negotiationa* a* Project managers may use negotiation techniques when dealing with func-
tional managers and other organizational department managers--and sometimes with the
vendor to get some of their best people--for project resources and for the timing of those
resources.
The following items are typically negotiated:
aOE   Availability
aOE   Competency level of the staff member assigned
Acquisitiona* a* Acquisition involves hiring individuals or teams of people for certain project
activities, as either employees or contract help during the course of the project or project
phase or for specific project activities.

Virtual Teamsa* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, virtual teams are defined as groups of
people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face
to face. The use of virtual teams makes it possible to draw in resources that wouldn't oth-
erwise be available. It also reduces travel expenses by allowing teams to work from home.
Virtual teams typically connect using technology tools, such as the Internet, email, and
videoconferencing.

Communication becomes essential when functioning in a virtual structure. All team
members should be made aware of the protocols for communicating in a virtual
team environment, understand the expectations, and be clear on the decisionmaking
processes.
Multicriteria Decision Analysisa* a* Multicriteria decision analysis involves the use of selec-
tion criteria to make decisions on whether potential project team members are a fit. Criteria
are typically assigned a weight based on their level of importance, and candidates are then
rated against the criteria. Some examples of criteria used include availability, experience,
ability, and cost.


Outputs of Acquire Project Team
Know the following three outputs of the Acquire Project Team process:
Project Staff Assignmentsa* a* Project staff assignments are based on the results of negotiating
and determining elements such as the roles and responsibilities and reviewing recruitment
practices. This output also results in a published project team directory, which lists the
names of all project team members and stakeholders.
Resource Calendarsa* a* Resource calendars show the team members' availability and
the times they are scheduled to work on the project. A composite resource calendar
includes availability information for potential resources as well as their capabilities and
skills.
Project Management Plan Updatesa* a* As a result of performing the Acquire Project Team
process, updates will be made to the human resource management plan and its correspond-
ing staffing management plan.


Conduct Procurements
In some cases, resources will need to be procured externally. The Conduct Procurements
process is concerned with obtaining responses to bids and proposals from potential ven-
dors, selecting a vendor, and awarding the contract. This process is used only when goods
or services are obtained from outside of the project's organization. After this process is con-
ducted, sellers will have been selected, contracts awarded, and project documents updated
to reflect the selected vendors.
   Figure 4.2 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Conduct
Procurements process.

                      PMP (R): Project Manager Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.




Inputs of Conduct Procurements
You should be familiar with several inputs of the Conduct Procurements process:
      Procurement management plan
      Procurement documents
      Source selection criteria
      Seller proposals
      Project documents
      Makeorbuy decisions
      Procurement statement of work
      Organizational process assets

Procurement Management Plan The procurement management plan is used to guide how
the procurement life cycle, and its corresponding processes, will be managed.
                                               Obtaining and Managing Resourcesa*...             223




Procurement Documentsa* a* The following procurement documents are typically used:
aOE   Requests for proposals (RFPs)
aOE   Requests for information (RFIs)
aOE   Requests for quotations (RFQs)
Source Selection Criteriaa* a* Source selection criteria include information on the vendor require-
ments that the project organization will use to make a decision on which vendor to select.
Seller Proposalsa* a* Seller proposals are the proposals submitted by sellers in response to a
procurement document package.
Project Documentsa* a* Project documents typically used as an input to this process include
the risk register and riskrelated contract decisions.
MakeorBuy Decisionsa* a* Makeorbuy decisions reflect which project deliverables will be
purchased and which will be handled internally within the organization. Buy decisions will
go through this process to select the vendor.
Procurement Statement of Worka* a* The procurement statement of work (SOW) describes
the goals, requirements, and outcomes required by the project team, which in turn allows
prospective sellers to determine whether they are qualified and capable of producing the
product or work.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Organizational process assets may contain information on
sellers used in past projects. This information is used in this process.
Tools and Techniques of Conduct Procurements
Know the following tools and techniques of the Conduct Procurements process:
aOE   Bidder conferences
aOE   Proposal evaluation techniques
aOE   Independent estimates
aOE   Expert judgment
aOE   Advertising
aOE   Analytical techniques
aOE   Procurement negotiations

Bidder Conferencesa* a* Bidder conferences, also known as vendor conferences, prebid con-
ferences, and contractor conferences, are meetings with prospective vendors or sellers that
occur prior to the completion of their response proposal. Bidder conferences have the fol-
lowing characteristics:
aOE   They allow all prospective vendors to meet with the buyers to ask questions and clarify
      issues they have regarding the project and the RFP.
aOE   They are held once.
224a*...       Chapter 4a*  a* Executing the Project



aOE    They are attended by all vendors at the same time.
aOE    They are held before vendors prepare their responses.

Proposal Evaluation Techniquesa* a* Several techniques can be used to evaluate proposals.
The types of goods and services you're trying to procure will dictate how detailed your
evaluation criteria are. Depending on the complexity of the procurements, you may use one
or more of the following techniques to evaluate and rate sellers:
aOE    Use the source selection criteria process to rate and score proposals.
aOE    When purchasing goods, request a sample from each vendor to compare quality (or
       some other criteria) against your need.
aOE    Ask vendors for references and/or financial records.
aOE    Evaluate the response itself to determine whether the vendor has a clear understanding
       of what you're asking them to do or provide.
After using the necessary techniques, compare each proposal against the criteria, and rate
or score each proposal for its ability to meet or fulfill these criteria. This can serve as your
first step in eliminating vendors that don't match your criteria. The next step is to apply the
tools and techniques of this process to further evaluate the remaining potential vendors.
Using a weighting system, you can assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then
multiply them by the weights of each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each
vendor. Screening systems and seller rating systems are also sometimes used.
Independent Estimatesa* a* Independent estimates, also known as cost estimates, may be
compiled by the buyer's organization to compare to the vendor prices and serve as a
Abenchmark. Estimates can also be prepared by an outside professional estimator like
trade associations of similar businesses.
Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment may include experts from all areas of the organization,
including external partners when evaluating proposals and selecting vendors.
Advertisinga* a* Advertising lets potential vendors know that an RFP is available. It can be used
as a way of expanding the pool of potential vendors, or it may be a requirement, such as in
the case of government projects. Here are some examples of where advertising may appear:
aOE    The company's Internet site
aOE    Professional journals
aOE    Newspapers
Analytical Techniquesa* a* Analytical techniques are used to help research potential vendors'
capabilities, get an idea of cost, analyze past performance, forecast future performance,
and learn from others who have undergone similar projects.
Procurement Negotiationsa* a* In procurement negotiations, both parties come to an agreement
regarding the contract terms. At a minimum, a contract should include the following items:
aOE    Price
aOE    Responsibilities
                                              Obtaining and Managing Resourcesa*...            225



aOE   Applicable regulations or laws that apply
aOE   Overall approach to the project
Once agreement is reached and the negotiations are finished, the contract is signed by both
buyer and seller and is executed.

Outputs of Conduct Procurements
The Conduct Procurements process contains the following six outputs:
aOE   Selected sellers
aOE   Agreements
aOE   Resource calendars
aOE   Change requests
aOE   Project management plan updates
aOE   Project documents updates

Selected Sellersa* a* Selected sellers are vendors that have been chosen to provide the goods or
services requested by the buyer.
Agreementsa* a* A procurement agreement is a legally binding agreement between two or
more parties, typically used to acquire goods or services. Agreements have several names:
aOE   Memorandums of understanding (MOUs)
aOE   Contracts
aOE   Purchase orders
The type of contract awarded depends on the product or services being procured and on
the organizational policies.
A contract's life cycle consists of four stages: requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award.
In the requirement stage, the project and contract needs are established and requirements are
defined within the statement of work (SOW). The requisition stage focuses on refining and
confirming the project objectives and generating solicitation materials, such as the request for
proposals (RFP), request for information (RFI), and request for quotations (RFQ). The solici-
tation stage is where vendors are asked to compete and respond to the solicitation materials.
And last, the award stage is where the vendors are chosen and contracts awarded.
The contract should clearly address the following:
aOE   Elements of the SOW
aOE   Time period of performance
aOE   Pricing and payment plan
aOE   Acceptance criteria
aOE   Warranty periods
aOE   Dispute resolution procedures and penalties
aOE   Roles and responsibilities
226         Chapter 4        Executing the Project




                      According to the PMBOK (R) Guide , a negotiated draft contract is one of
                      the requirements of the selected sellers output. Also note that senior
                      management signatures may be required on complex, highrisk, or high
                      dollar contracts. Be certain to check your organization's procurement
                      policies regarding the authority level and amounts you are authorized to
                      sign for.


Resource Calendars        Resource calendars will contain the following information on pro-
curement resources:
      Quantity
      Availability
      Dates resources are active or idle

Change Requests Change requests may include changes to the project management plan
and its subsidiary plans and components. These changes are submitted to the change con-
trol board for review.
Project Management Plan Updates The following elements of the project management
plan may need to be updated as a result of this process:
      Procurement management plan
      Communications management plan
      Cost, scope, and schedule baselines

Project Documents Updates         The following documents may need to be updated as a result
of this process:
      Requirements documentation and requirements traceability matrix
      Risk register
      Stakeholder register

expert judgment, and proposal evaluation techniques.

Be able to name the contracting life cycle stages.a* a* The stages of the contracting life
cycle are requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award.




Maximizing Team Performance
Maximizing team performance involves leading, mentoring, training, and motivating team
members. The project manager leads these efforts with the guidance of the documented
human resource management plan. The processes used to achieve maximum team perfor-
mance include Develop Project Team and Manage Project Team, which are both a part of
the Project Human Resource Management Knowledge Area.
   To be successful, project managers will need to be familiar with several leadership theo-
ries, the stages of team development, motivational theories, and leadership styles. Being
familiar with and understanding conflict resolution techniques and types of power are also
important when managing teams.

Develop Project Team
The Develop Project Team process is concerned with creating a positive environment for
team members; developing the team into an effective, functioning, coordinated group; and
increasing the team's competency levels. The proper development of the team is critical to a
successful project. Since teams are made up of individuals, individual development becomes
a critical factor to project success.

                   Eighth Edition.



Inputs of Develop Project Team
The Develop Project Team process includes the following inputs:
Human Resource Management Plan The human resource management plan, a subsidiary
plan of the project management plan, provides guidance on how the project team is to be
developed.
Project Staff Assignments The list of project team members is obtained through the
project staff assignments created from within the Acquire Project Team process.
Resource Calendars Resource calendars provide details about the availability of team
members. This is important when coordinating team development activities to ensure
participation from all team members.

Tools and Techniques of Develop Project Team
Before we review the tools and techniques of the Develop Project Team process, it is
helpful to understand some key concepts and theories about leadership, management,
and motivation.

Leadership vs. Management
Project managers need to use the traits of both leaders and managers at different times dur-
ing a project. Therefore, it's important to understand the difference between the two.
   Leaders display the following characteristics:
      Impart vision, motivate and inspire, and are concerned with strategic vision
      Have a knack for getting others to do what needs to be done
      Use and understand the following two techniques:
          Power, which is the ability to get people to do what they wouldn't do ordinarily,
          and the ability to influence behavior
          Politics, which imparts pressure to conform regardless of whether people agree
          with the decision
      Have committed team members who believe in their vision
      Set direction and time frames and have the ability to attract good talent to work
      for them
      Are directive in their approach but allow for plenty of feedback and input
      Have strong interpersonal skills and are well respected
                                                   Maximizing Team Performancea*...            229




Managers display the following characteristics:
aOE   Are generally taskoriented and concerned with issues such as plans, controls, budgets,
      policies, and procedures
aOE   Are generalists with a broad base of planning and organizational skills
aOE   Have a primary goal of satisfying stakeholder needs
aOE   Possess motivational skills and the ability to recognize and reward behavior

There are four particularly notable theories regarding leadership and management:
Theory X & Ya* a* Douglas McGregor defined two models of worker behavior, Theory X and
Theory Y, that attempt to explain how different managers deal with their team members.
Theory X managers believe the following statements to be true:
aOE   Most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it.
aOE   People have little to no ambition and need constant supervision.
aOE   People won't actually perform the duties of their job unless threatened.

As a result, Theory X managers are like dictators and impose very rigid controls over their
employees. They believe people are motivated only by punishment, money, or position.
  Theory Y managers have the following characteristics:
aOE   Believe people are interested in performing their best given the right motivation and
      proper expectations
aOE   Provide support to their teams
aOE   Are concerned about their team members
aOE   Are good listeners

Theory Y managers believe people are creative and committed to the project goals, that
they like responsibility and seek it out, and that they are able to perform the functions of
their positions with limited supervision.
Theory Za* a* Theory Z was developed by William Ouchi. This theory is concerned with
increasing employee loyalty to their organization and results in increased productivity.
Theory Z has the following characteristics:
aOE   Puts an emphasis on the wellbeing of the employees both at work and outside of work
aOE   Encourages steady employment
aOE   Leads to high employee satisfaction and morale

Theory Z develops employee loyalty through group decision making, which also results in a
sense of being valued and respected.

Figure 4.4 highlights the differences between a Theory X manager, a Theory Y manager,
and a Theory Z manager.

                                                    respected and participate
                                                    in group discussions



Contingency Theorya* a* The Contingency theory builds on a combination of Theory Y
behaviors and the Hygiene theory. (The Hygiene theory is discussed shortly, in the sec-
tion "Motivational Theories.") The Contingency theory says that people are motivated
to achieve levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by this need even after
Acompetency is reached.
Situational Theorya* a* Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard developed the Situational Leadership
theory during the mid1970s. This theory's main premise is that the leadership style you use
depends on the situation. Both Hersey and Blanchard went on to develop their own situa-
tional leadership models. Blanchard's model, Situational Leadership II, describes four styles
of leadership that depend on the situation: directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating.

Leadership Styles
A project manager can use various leadership styles, and in many cases, the appropriate
leadership style is based on the situation. The following are examples of leadership styles:
Autocratica* a* All decisions are made by the leader.
Laissezfaira* a* The leader uses a handsoff approach and allows the team to drive the
decisions.
Democratica* a* Leaders gather all facts and receive input from the team before reaching a
decision.
Situationala* a* Based on the Blanchard theory of situational leadership that uses four styles:
directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating.
Transactional and Transformationala* a* Developed by Bernard Bass. He described transac-
tional leaders as activityfocused and autonomous; they use contingent reward systems and
                                                 Maximizing Team Performance               231




manage by exception. Transformational leaders are described as focusing on relationships
rather than activities.

The Power of Leaders
Leaders, managers, and project managers use power to convince others to do tasks a spe-
cific way. The kind of power they use to accomplish this depends on their personality, their
personal values, and the company culture. Here are five forms of power leaders may use:
    Punishment power, also known as coercive or penalty power, is exerted when employ-
    ees are threatened with consequences if expectations are not met.


                 Punishment power should be used as a last resort and only after all other
                 forms have been exhausted.


    Expert power is exerted when the person being influenced believes the manager, or the
    person doing the influencing, is knowledgeable about the subject or has special abilities
    that make them an expert.
    Legitimate power, also known as formal power, is exerted when power comes about as
    a result of the influencer's position.
    Referent power is obtained by the influencer through a higher authority.
    Reward power is the ability to grant bonuses and incentives for a job well done.

Motivational Theories
There are many theories on motivation, and as a project manager, you should understand
and tailor the recognition and rewards programs around the project team. The following
are some important motivational theories to note:
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Abraham Maslow theorized that humans have five basic
sets of needs arranged in hierarchical order. The idea is that each set of needs must be met
before a person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy. Once that need is
met, they progress to the next level, and so on. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory sug-
gests that once a lowerlevel need has been met, it no longer serves as a motivator, and the
nexthigher level becomes the driving motivator in a person's life. Maslow theorized that
humans are always in one state of need or another and they can move up and down the
pyramid throughout their lives. The following is a brief review of the needs, as shown in
Figure 4.5, starting with the highest level and ending with the lowest:
    Selfactualization--Highest level; performing at your peak potential
    Selfesteem needs--Accomplishment, respect for self, capability
    Social needs--A sense of belonging, love, acceptance, friendship
    Safety and security needs--Your physical welfare and the security of your belongings
    Basic physical needs--Lowest level; food, clothing, shelter

Hygiene Theorya* a* Frederick Herzberg came up with the Hygiene theory, also known as the
MotivationHygiene theory. He postulated that two factors contribute to motivation:
aOE   Hygiene factors, which prevent dissatisfaction, deal with work environment issues, and
      include factors such as pay, benefits, conditions of the work environment, and relation-
      ships with peers and managers.
aOE   Motivators, which lead to satisfaction, deal with the substance of the work itself and
      the satisfaction one derives from performing the functions of the job. According to
      Herzberg, the ability to advance, the opportunity to learn new skills, and the chal-
      lenges involved in the work are all motivators.
Expectancy Theorya* a* The Expectancy theory, first proposed by Victor Vroom, says that the
expectation of a positive outcome drives motivation. People will behave in certain ways if
they think there will be good rewards for doing so and if they themselves value the reward.
Also note that this theory says the strength of the expectancy drives the behavior. This
means the expectation or likelihood of the reward is linked to the behavior. This theory
also says that people become what you expect of them.
Achievement Theorya* a* The Achievement theory, attributed to David McClelland, says that
people are motivated by the need for three things:
aOE   Achievement, as a result of a need to achieve or succeed
aOE   Power, which involves a desire to influence the behavior of others
aOE   Affiliation, as a result of a need to develop relationships with others

Tools and Techniques
You should know the following tools and techniques of the Develop Project Team process:
aOE    Interpersonal skills
aOE    Training
aOE    Teambuilding activities
aOE    Ground rules
aOE    Colocation
aOE    Recognition and rewards
aOE    Personnel assessment tools

Interpersonal Skillsa* a* Interpersonal skills, often referred to as soft skills, include items such
as these:
aOE    Leadership
aOE    Influence
aOE    Negotiation
aOE    Communications
aOE    Empathy
aOE    Creativity

By possessing these skills, the project management team can reduce issues within the proj-
ect team and better manage the team overall.
Traininga* a* Training is a matter of assessing the team members' skills and abilities,
assessing the project needs, and providing the training necessary for the team mem-
bers to carry out their assigned activities. Training can sometimes be a reward as well.
Training needs may be incorporated into the staffing management plan or scheduled as
training needs should be assessed.
TeamBuilding Activitiesa* a* Part of the project manager's job is to bring the team together;
get its members headed in the right direction; and provide motivation, reward, and recogni-
tion. This is done using a variety of teambuilding techniques and exercises. Team building
involves getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient and effec-
tive manner possible.
Important to teambuilding activities are the theories behind team development. Authors
Bruce Tuckman and Mary Ann Jensen developed a model that describes how teams develop
and mature. According to Tuckman and Jensen, all newly formed teams go through the
Afollowing five stages of development:
      Forminga* a* Forming occurs at the beginning stage of team formation, when team mem-
      bers are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. Team mem-
      bers tend to behave in a formal and reserved manner.
234a*...      Chapter 4a*  a* Executing the Project



      Storminga* a* Storming is the stage when action begins. Team members tend to be confron-
      tational with one another as they're vying for position and control.
      Norminga* a* Norming is the stage when team members are comfortable with one another
      and begin to confront project concerns and issues.
      Performinga* a* Performing is the stage when the team becomes productive and effective. Trust
      among team members is high, and this is considered to be the mature development stage.
      Adjourninga* a* The adjourning stage is when the team is released after the work is completed.
Figure 4.6 shows the stages of a team's development.

F i g u r e 4 . 6 a* a* Stages of team development

                              Storming                Performing



Ground Rulesa* a* Ground rules are expectations set by the project manager and project team
that describe acceptable team behavior. Outlining ground rules helps the team understand
expectations regarding acceptable behavior and increases productivity.
Colocationa* a* Colocation refers to basing team members out of the same physical location.
Colocation enables teams to function more effectively than if they're spread out among
Adifferent localities. One way to achieve colocation might be to set aside a common Ameeting
room, sometimes called a war room, for team members who are located in different
Abuildings or across town to meet and exchange information.
Recognition and Rewardsa* a* Recognition and rewards are an important part of team
Amotivation. They are formal ways of recognizing and promoting desirable behavior and
are most effective when carried out by the management team and the project manager.
Criteria for rewards should be developed and documented, and rewards should be given
to team members who go above and beyond the call of duty.
Motivation can be extrinsic or intrinsic:
aOE    Extrinsic motivators are material rewards and might include bonuses, the use of a com-
       pany car, stock options, gift certificates, training opportunities, extra time off, and so
       on. Any reward should satisfy the need that is valued by an individual, and sometimes
       can be in the form of a handshake or other form of recognition.
aOE    Intrinsic motivators are specific to the individual. Cultural and religious influences are
       forms of intrinsic motivators as well. When a person is driven by their own desire to do
       well, they are intrinsically motivated.

The recognition and rewards tool of this process is an example of an extrinsic motivator.

Personnel Assessment Tools Personnel assessment tools capture feedback obtained
on the project team's level of effectiveness. The intention is to increase the probability
of the team's success in achieving the project objectives through the increase of perfor-
mance. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, team performance is measured against the
following:
    Technical success
    Performance against the schedule
    Performance against the budget


Outputs of Develop Project Team
The following two outputs result from the Develop Project Team process:
Team Performance Assessments Team performance assessments involve determining the
project team's effectiveness. Assessing these characteristics helps to determine where (or
whether) the project team needs improvements. The following indicators are among those
assessed:

    Improvements in the team's skills
    Improvements in the team's competencies
    Lower staff attrition
    Greater level of team cohesiveness

Enterprise Environmental Factors Updates Updates to the enterprise environmental
factors typically include updates to team records regarding training and skill assess-
ment and any personnel administration updates that resulted from carrying out this
process.



Manage Project Team
The Manage Project Team process is concerned with tracking and reporting on the perfor-
mance of individual team members. During this process, performance appraisals are pre-
pared and conducted, issues are identified and resolved, and feedback is given to the team
members. This process involves management skills that promote teamwork and result in
highperformance teams.
   Figure 4.7 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Manage Project
Team process.

           * Interpersonal skills




Inputs of Manage Project Team
There are six inputs of the Manage Project Team process:
aOE   Human resource management plan
aOE   Project staff assignments
aOE   Team performance assessments
aOE   Issue log
aOE   Work performance reports
aOE   Organizational process assets

Human Resource Management Plana* a* The human resource management plan provides the
following information that is used in this process:
aOE   Staffing management plan
aOE   Roles and responsibilities
aOE   The project organization chart
Project Staff Assignmentsa* a* Project staff assignments provide the list of project team mem-
bers and their assignments for use in this process.
Team Performance Assessmentsa* a* Team performance assessments, which are an output of
the Develop Project Team process, provide necessary information and insight into the per-
formance and issues of the project team. This information is necessary for managing the
group and taking action to resolve any issues and to foster improvement.

Issue Loga* a* The issue log is a place to document the issues that prevent the project team
from meeting project goals. In addition to the issue, the following should be noted:
aOE   Who is responsible for resolving the issue
aOE   Date the resolution is needed
In terms of this process, the issue log provides key information on open issues and
who is responsible for their resolution or followup. This information allows the proj-
ect manager to maintain oversight in ensuring that the project team follows up as
necessary.
Work Performance Reportsa* a* Work performance reports document the status of the proj-
ect compared to the forecasts. For additional information on performance reports, see the
outputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process in Chapter 5, "Monitoring and
Controlling the Project," in this book.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* Organizational process assets used in this process include
any existing organizational perks and forms of recognition.


Tools and Techniques of Manage Project Team
Know the following tools and techniques of the Manage Project Team process:
aOE   Observation and conversation
aOE   Project performance appraisals
aOE   Conflict management
aOE   Interpersonal skills

Observation and Conversationa* a* Observing team performance can be used as an assess-
ment tool. Both observation and conversation help the project management team stay tuned
in to the attitudes and feelings of the project team members, making both an important
tool for communication.
Project Performance Appraisalsa* a* Project performance appraisals are typically annual
or semiannual affairs where managers let their employees know what they think of their
Aperformance and rate them accordingly. These are usually managertoemployee exchanges
but can incorporate a 360degree review, which takes in feedback from nearly everyone
the team member interacts with, including key stakeholders, customers, project managers,
peers, subordinates, and the delivery person if they have a significant amount of project
interaction.
Performance appraisal time is also a good time to do the following:
aOE   Assess training needs
aOE   Clarify roles and responsibilities
aOE   Set goals for the future
238a*...      Chapter 4a*  a* Executing the Project



Conflict Managementa* a* Conflict exists when the desires, needs, or goals of one party are
incompatible with the desires, needs, or goals of another party (or parties). Conflict is the
incompatibility of goals, which often leads to one party resisting or blocking the other
party from attaining their goals. Conflict management is how an individual deals with
these types of scenarios or issues.
The following five methods of conflict management are also shown in Figure 4.8:
F i g u r e 4 . 8 a* a* Conflict resolution techniques


                                          Conflict Resolution Techniques


                                                                     Collaborating /   Withdrawing /
                                  Smoothing /    Compromising /
            Forcing/Directing                                       Problem Solving      Avoiding
                                Accommodating      Reconciling
               (win-lose)                                           (win-win, BEST      (lose-lose,
                                   (lose-lose)     (lose-lose)
                                                                         option)       WORST option)




      Forcing/Directinga* a* One person forces a solution on the other parties. This is an exam-
      ple of a winlose conflict resolution technique.
      Smoothing/Accommodatinga* a* Smoothing/accommodating is a temporary way to resolve
      conflict in which the areas of agreement are emphasized over the areas of difference, so
      the real issue stays buried. This is an example of a loselose conflict resolution technique
      because neither side wins.
      Compromising/Reconcilinga* a* Compromise is achieved when each of the parties involved
      in the conflict gives up something to reach a solution. This is an example of a loselose
      conflict resolution technique because neither side gets what they wanted.
      Collaborating/Problem Solvinga* a* Collaboration and problem solving are the best ways
      to resolve conflict. One of the key actions performed with this technique is a factfinding
      mission. This is the conflict resolution approach project managers use most often and is
      an example of a winwin conflict resolution technique.
      Withdrawing/Avoidinga* a* An example of withdrawal/avoidance is when one of the par-
      ties gets up, leaves, and refuses to discuss the conflict. This is an example of a loselose
      conflict resolution technique because no solution is ever reached. This is considered to be
      the worst conflict resolution technique.
The following should also be noted about conflict and conflict resolution:
aOE    In any situation, conflict should be dealt with as soon as it arises.
aOE    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, when you have successfully resolved conflict, it will
       result in increased productivity and better, more positive working relationships.
aOE    Most conflicts are a result of schedule issues, availability of resources (usually the lack
       of availability), or personal work habits.
                                                   Maximizing Team Performancea*...            239



aOE   Team members should be encouraged to resolve their own conflicts.
aOE   Ground rules, established policies, and procedures help mitigate conflict before it
      arises.

Executing the Project Management Plan
Executing the project management plan is carried out through the Direct and Manage
Project Work process, which is a process that belongs to the Project Integration
Management Knowledge Area. This is where the project work is carried out, according
to the plan, as a way of producing the deliverables on time and on budget. The Direct
and Manage Project Work process is also responsible for implementing changes that have
                                          Executing the Project Management Plan                  241




been approved by the change control board. Typically, approved changes are implemented
according to the change management plan as a way of meeting project requirements.
   When implementing the plan, the project manager will need to be proactive in manag-
ing project communications. This includes distributing relevant project information in
an efficient and effective manner. Managing stakeholder expectations is also important
at this stage. Both of these objectives can be accomplished by carrying out the Manage
Communications and Management Stakeholder Engagement processes in accordance with
the communications management plan and stakeholder management plan.


Direct and Manage Project Work
The Direct and Manage Project Work process is responsible for carrying out the proj-
ect management plan. The project manager oversees the actual work, staying on top
of issues and problems and keeping the work lined up with the plan. Coordinating and
integrating all the elements of the project are among the most challenging aspects of
this process.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this process also requires implementing corrective
actions to bring the work of the project back into alignment with the project management
plan, preventive actions to reduce the probability of negative consequences, and repairs to
correct product defects discovered during the quality management processes.
   Figure 4.9 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Direct and Manage
Project Work process.

Execution process, the project management information system (PMIS) provides the ability
to connect to automated tools, such as scheduling software and configuration management
systems, that can be used during project execution.
Meetingsa* a* Meetings are a key tool in managing the work of the project. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, there are three types of meetings: information exchange, working ses-
sions such as brainstorming and design, and decision making.

Outputs of Direct and Manage Project Work
These five outputs result from carrying out the Direct and Manage Project Work process:
aOE   Deliverables
aOE   Work performance data
aOE   Change requests
aOE   Project management plan updates
aOE   Project documents updates

Deliverablesa* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a deliverable (see Figure 4.10) is defined
as any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is
required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.

                                                Deliverable




During the Direct and Manage Project Work process, the following information regarding
the outcomes of the work is gathered and recorded:
aOE   Activity completion dates
aOE   Milestone completions
aOE   Status of the deliverables
244            Chapter 4      Executing the Project



            Quality of the deliverables
            Costs
            Schedule progress and updates


                     Although the PMBOK (R) Guide breaks up these processes for ease of expla-
                     nation, several of the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes
                     are performed together. Remember that the processes are iterative.


Work Performance Data Work performance data involves gathering, documenting, and
recording the status of project work. Here are types of information that may be gathered
during this process:
       Schedule status and progress
       Status of deliverable completion
       Progress and status of schedule activities
       Adherence to quality standards
       Status of costs (those authorized and costs incurred to date)
       Schedule activity completion estimates for those activities started
       Percentage of schedule activities completed
       Lessons learned
       Resource consumption and utilization
Change Requests Changes can come about from several sources, including stakeholder
requests, external sources, and technological advances. An approved change request will sup-
plant the existing document, deliverable, or baseline, and are agreed on through negotiation of
the requestor and the project team. Change requests may encompass changes to the following:
       Schedule
       Scope
       Requirement
       Resource changes
Implementation of change requests may incorporate the following actions:
      Corrective Actions Corrective actions are taken to get the anticipated future project
      outcomes to align with the project plan.
      Preventive Actions Preventive actions involve anything that will reduce the potential
      impacts of negative risk events should they occur. Contingency plans and risk responses
      are examples of preventive action.
      Defect Repairs Defects are project components that do not meet the requirements or spec-
      ifications. Defect repairs are discovered during quality audits or when inspections are per-
      formed. A validated defect repair is the result of a reinspection of the original defect repair.

Manage Communications
The Manage Communications process is responsible for getting information about the proj-
ect to stakeholders in a timely manner. It describes how reports, and other information, are
collected, stored, retrieved, and distributed, and to whom. Executing the communications
management plan also occurs during this process.

Implementing Approved Changes
As described in the previous section, the need for changes will emerge as the project work
is executed. All change requests created to deal with this need must first be approved by the
change control board before they can be implemented. This occurs through the Perform
Integrated Change Control process, which is discussed in Chapter 5 and must be managed
according to the change management plan.
    It's also important to keep in mind that the moment the work enters into the executing
stage of the project, monitoring and controlling activities begin and continue concurrently
as the work is progressing. Monitoring and controlling activities also identify the need
for corrective and preventive actions as well as defect repairs. Once change requests are
approved, they are implemented through the Direct and Manage Project Work process,
discussed previously.



Exam Essentials

Be able to describe the various steps that a change request progresses through. a*...
Change requests are reviewed by the change control board through the Perform Inte-
grated Change Control process. If approved, the changes are then implemented through
the Direct and Manage Project Work process.




Implementing the Quality
Management Plan
Implementing the quality management plan occurs throughout the Executing and
Monitoring and Controlling process groups. During Executing, quality assurance activities
take place. Quality assurance is responsible for auditing quality control activities and the
effectiveness of the project management processes. These activities are carried out through
the Perform Quality Assurance process.
    The Perform Quality Assurance process involves performing systematic quality activities
and uses quality audits to determine which processes should be used to achieve the project
requirements and to assure that they are performed efficiently and effectively. This process
also brings about continuous process improvement through improved process performance
and eliminating unnecessary actions. This is done by assessing whether the processes are
efficient and whether they can be improved.
    Figure 4.13 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Perform Quality
Assurance process.

tools and techniques also used during the Plan Quality Management and Control Quality
processes. The following tools and techniques are included within the quality management
and control tools of this process:
    Affinity diagrams
    Process decision program charts (PDPC)
    Interrelationship diagraphs
    Tree diagrams
    Prioritization matrices
    Activity network diagrams
    Matrix diagrams


                     For a description of the tools and techniques also used in the Plan Quality
                     Management process, see Chapter 3, "Planning the Project," in this book.

Exam Essentials

Be able to describe the purpose of the Perform Quality Assurance process.a* a* The
Perform Quality Assurance process is concerned with making certain the project will
meet and satisfy the quality standards of the project.




Implementing the Risk
Management Plan
As the work of the project is executed, predefined risk triggers may occur and some risks
will be realized, calling for the execution of risk response plans, contingency plans, and
fallback plans. These responses are defined within the risk register and should be managed
according to the risk management plan. The risk management plan is important in reducing
the impact of negative risks on the project.
   Because the PMBOK(R) Guide addresses the executing activities of risk management
within the Monitoring and Controlling process group, this will be further addressed in
Chapter 5.



Exam Essentials

Be able to describe where risk response plans are documented and when they are
executed.a* a* Risk response plans, contingency plans, and fallback plans are documented in
the risk register and are executed when predefined risk triggers occur.

Bringing the Processes Together
Let's briefly review the processes that were covered in this chapter and, more importantly, how
these processes work together. You may recall that the primary objective of the Executing process
group is to complete the work defined in the project management plan. In addition to this, we
coordinate and manage resources, implement approved changes, and manage communications.
   As we went through the processes covered in this chapter, you may have noticed an
ongoing theme: human resources. Whether these resources were internal to the organiza-
tion or external, we covered a lot of information that dealt with the project team, including
obtaining the resources and managing them. We also covered the management of stake-
holder expectations and their engagement.
   Figure 4.15 shows how peoplecentric the Executing process group really is. Within the
realms of this figure, we see the following take place:
aOE   The project information is planned.
aOE   The planned information is handed off to the project team for execution of the project work.
aOE   The project team's execution of the work generates results, which must be monitored
      and controlled.
aOE   The results are fed back into the previous processes as necessary to improve the work
      and make changes and updates as needed.

   Clearly, a lot of behindthescenes effort goes into the executing stage. For example, the
project team must be assembled and managed.
   Altogether, we covered eight processes within this chapter, which make up the Executing
process group. These processes spanned the following Knowledge Areas:
aOE   Project Integration Management
aOE   Project Quality Management
                                                     Bringing the Processes Togethera*...   257



aOE   Project Human Resource Management
aOE   Project Communications Management
aOE   Project Procurement Management
aOE   Project Stakeholder Management
  Next, we will review the process interactions that occur within each Knowledge Area
during the Executing process group.


Project Integration Management Knowledge
Area Review
During the Executing process group, the Project Integration Management Knowledge
Area covers the implementation of the project management plan through a single process
known as the Direct and Manage Project Work process. As Figure 4.16 shows, the project
management plan and the approved changes (which occur after the work has already been
executed) are carried out through this process. As a result, deliverables and information on
the work performance during the project are generated.

Project Quality Management Knowledge Area Review
The Perform Quality Assurance process is the only qualityrelated process that falls within
the Executing process group. As you may recall, this is where auditing takes place, which
ultimately leads to implemented changes and continuous process improvement. The follow-
ing items are among those that are audited:
aOE   Quality requirements
aOE   Results from quality control measurements
258a*...   Chapter 4a*  a* Executing the Project



   Figure 4.17 provides a glimpse into the information needed to perform the quality audits.
Quality metrics, which were defined in the Planning process group, provide work performance
data and quality measurements. These quality measurements are gathered while the project's
quality is being monitored and controlled. You can see the level of interaction between the
three quality processes throughout the life cycle of the project. The processes are iterative.

Project Human Resource Management
Knowledge Area Review
Three of the four processes related to human resources occur within the Executing process
group. Remember that this process group involves coordinating and managing people, and
you cannot implement the project work without a project team. Figure 4.18 shows, step by
step, how the project team comes together so that the project work can be rolled out.

     Here is an overview of these steps:
1.    Using the project management plan as an information resource, bring the project team
      on board and issue staff assignments.
2.    Throughout project execution, assess the performance of the project team for devel-
      opmental purposes. This includes enhancing the team's skills, monitoring the level of
      interaction among the group members, and improving the team's overall performance.
3.    Use the performance assessment that was generated in the second step to manage the
      team. Here, issues are resolved and changes are managed. The result? Changes are rec-
      ommended to resolve any staffing issues that may have emerged.


Project Communications Management
Knowledge Area Review
As the project work is executed, communication becomes more important than ever. All of
the planning behind how communication will take place within the project goes into effect.
This is where knowing the communication needs and requirements of your stakeholders
becomes particularly important. Be sure you place a great level of importance on knowing
your stakeholders.
   There is one communicationsrelated process within the Executing process group that
makes project information available to stakeholders. As you can see in Figure 4.19, the
stakeholder communication requirements must be developed before you can manage com-
munications. After all, you cannot meet your team's communication needs if you do not
know what they are. These communication needs and requirements are determined in the
Initiating and Planning process groups.

    Figure 4.19 also shows how the management of the project stakeholder communications
fits in with the communication processes. This step involves addressing any existing issues
260a*...    Chapter 4a*  a* Executing the Project



and recommending changes to resolve conflicts. It also involves the management of stake-
holder engagement with the idea of unifying the project goals.


Project Procurement Management
Knowledge Area Review
During the Executing process group, vendors are selected for work that will be handled
externally. Conducting procurements is part of obtaining and hiring the resources needed
to complete the project work. As you can see, much of project execution involves hiring and
managing people resources--internal and external to the organization.
   Figure 4.20 shows how the single procurement process that takes place during project
execution results in the selection of the project's sellers and the issuance of procurement
contracts. To arrive at this outcome, you will use several planned procurement items:
aOE   Results of the makeorbuy decisions made during the planning phase
aOE   List of qualified vendors (sellers) and their proposals
aOE   Criteria that will be used to select the vendors
aOE   Any agreements or documents impacting vendor selection
aOE   Procurement management plan

                                          contracts.




Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge
Area Review
Stakeholder management is critical to the success of the project, particularly when the
Aproject team is actively executing the project work. During the Executing process group,
the project manager actively engages with stakeholders to ensure that their needs and
expectations are met.
                                                  Bringing the Processes Togethera*...     261

   As you reflect on the Executing process group, always remember that the key purpose is
to complete the project work.

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Monitoring and Controlling
          performance domain covered
          in this chapter includes the
          following:

          aoefi Measure project performance using appropriate tools and
                techniques in order to identify and quantify any variances
                and corrective actions.

          aoefi Manage changes to the project by following the change
                management plan in order to ensure that project goals
                remain aligned with business needs.

          aoefi Verify that project deliverables conform to the quality
                standards established in the quality management plan by
                using appropriate tools and techniques to meet project
                requirements and business needs.

          aoefi Monitor and assess risk by determining whether exposure
                has changed and evaluating the effectiveness of response
                strategies in order to manage the impact of risks and
                opportunities on the project.

          aoefi Review the issue log, update if necessary, and determine
                corrective actions by using appropriate tools and tech-
                niques in order to minimize the impact on the project.

          aoefi Capture, analyze, and manage lessons-learned, using les-
                sons learned management techniques in order to enable
                continuous improvement.

          aoefi Monitor procurement activities according to the pro-
                curement plan in order to verify compliance with project
                objectives.
                                Monitoring and Controlling is the fourth of the five project
                                management process groups and accounts for 25 percent
                                of the questions on the PMP(R) exam. The processes in the
Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrate on monitoring and measuring proj-
ect performance to identify variances from the project management plan and get them back
on track. Regularly monitoring project performance provides insight into the current state
of the project and allows you to correct areas that are falling off track before they impact
your project significantly. The Monitoring and Controlling process group is concerned not
only with monitoring the project work but also with the project as a whole. In multiphase
projects, this process group coordinates the project phases.

As the project work is carried out, it is important to monitor the project performance
closely. This can be done by using various tools and techniques that assist in identifying
and quantifying variances as well as determining the necessary corrective action needed.
Monitoring project performance occurs through the Monitor and Control Project Work
process, part of the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area.
   Work performed by sellers (resources external to the organization) are monitored and
controlled through the Control Procurements process. Control Procurements is a process
that belongs to the Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area.


Monitor and Control Project Work
The Monitor and Control Project Work process involves monitoring all the processes in
the Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing process groups to meet the performance
objectives outlined in the project management plan. Collecting data, measuring results,
and reporting on performance information are some of the activities performed during this
process.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Monitor and Control Project Work process
encompasses the following:
aOE   Reporting and comparing actual project results against the project management plan
aOE   Analyzing performance data and determining whether corrective or preventive action
      is needed
                                                           Measuring Project Performance                269

Inputs of Monitor and Control Project Work
Know the following inputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process:
    Project management plan
    Schedule forecasts
    Cost forecasts
    Validated changes
270         Chapter 5      Monitoring and Controlling the Project



      Work performance information
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
Project Management Plan The project management plan provides the information necessary
to monitor the project work and determine whether the project is progressing as planned.
Schedule Forecasts Schedule forecasts reflect whether the project is on track, ahead, or behind
schedule, typically expressed in the form of schedule variance (SV) or schedule performance
index (SPI). SV and SPI are calculated using earned value management (EVM) techniques.
Cost Forecasts Cost forecasts reflect whether the project is on, over, or under budget. Like
schedule forecasts, cost forecasts may be calculated using EVM, and expressed in the form
of cost variance (CV) or cost performance index (CPI). In addition to CV and CPI, the esti-
mate at completion (EAC) may be calculated to determine whether forecasts are within a
tolerable range from the planned budget.


                   Earned value management (EVM) is reviewed later within this chapter. EVM
                   includes the calculation and explanation of schedule and cost forecasts.


Validated Changes Validated changes are those changes that have been reviewed and
approved by a change control board and have also been validated from a quality perspec-
tive. Through this process, changes are reviewed to ensure that they have been imple-
mented correctly and the desired result has been achieved.
Work Performance Information Work performance information provides informa-
tion produced as a result of carrying out various processes within the Monitoring and
Controlling process group. It reflects performance data that has been analyzed and can
therefore be used to make project decisions.
Enterprise Environmental Factors The enterprise environmental factors provide the
following information used by this process:
      Government or industry standards
      Work authorization systems
      Stakeholder risk tolerances
Organizational Process Assets The following organizational process assets are used as inputs:
      Communication requirements
      Procedures for financial controls, risk control, and problem solving
      Lessons learned database

Tools and Techniques of Monitor and Control Project Work
The Monitor and Control Project Work process has four tools and techniques: expert
judgment, analytical techniques, project management information system, and meetings.
                                                  Measuring Project Performancea*...        271




Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment involves interpreting the information that results from
this process and making key project decisions as a result of the information.
Analytical Techniquesa* a* In the scope of this process, analytical techniques involve using
various techniques to forecast possible scenarios based on existing variables. The PMBOK(R)
Guide provides the following examples:
aOE   Regression analysis
aOE   Grouping methods
aOE   Causal analysis
aOE   Root cause analysis
aOE   Forecasting methods
aOE   Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)
aOE   Fault tree analysis (FTA)
aOE   Reserve analysis
aOE   Trend analysis
aOE   Earned value management
aOE   Variance analysis
Project Management Information Systema* a* There are various project management informa-
tion systems (PMISs) that may be used through this process. Typically, these tools are used
to help in forecasting calculations.
Meetingsa* a* This process involves a high degree of interaction and analysis by project
experts. When used appropriately, meetings can be a powerful mechanism for project team
members and other subject matter experts to discuss project performance and to make
decisions.


Outputs of Monitor and Control Project Work
The Monitor and Control Project Work process has four outputs:
Change Requestsa* a* As a result of assessing project performance and making decisions on
how to proceed based on this information, changes may be required. Change requests typi-
cally include the following items:
aOE   Corrective actions, intended to bring the project back on track with the plan
aOE   Preventive actions, intended to prevent the project from getting off track with the plan
aOE   Defect repairs, intended to address product or product components that do not con-
      form to requirements
Work Performance Reportsa* a* As a result of assessing work performance information,
work performance reports are compiled through this process; according to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, work performance reports are physical or electronic representations of performance
data. By documenting this information, it can be distributed to stakeholders and archived
272a*...        Chapter 5a*  a* Monitoring and Controlling the Project



for future reference. Work performance reports can also be used as a means of increasing
awareness and making decisions in relation to the project.
Project Management Plan Updatesa* a* Project management plan updates may include updates
to one or more of the following:
aOE    Schedule management plan
aOE    Cost management plan
aOE    Quality management plan
aOE    Scope baseline
aOE    Schedule baseline
aOE    Cost baseline
Project Documents Updatesa* a* Project documents updates may include updates to the following:
aOE    Forecasts
aOE    Performance reports
aOE    Issue log


Control Procurements
The Control Procurements process is concerned with monitoring the vendor's performance
and ensuring that all requirements of the contract are met. This process also manages the
procurement relationships overall and makes changes and corrections as needed.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you must integrate and coordinate the Direct and
Manage Project Work, Control Quality, Perform Integrated Change Control, and Control
Risks processes during the Control Procurements process.
   Figure 5.2 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Control
Procurements process.

                  For more detailed information on the Control Procurements process, see
                  Chapter 10 in PMP(R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide,
                  Eighth Edition.

Inputs of Control Procurements
Know the following inputs of the Control Procurements process:
    Project management plan
    Procurement documents
    Agreements
    Approved change requests
    Work performance reports
    Work performance data

Project Management Plan The project management plan includes the procurement man-
agement plan, which guides the project management team in properly carrying out the
process. It also documents how the contracts will be managed through to closure.
Procurement Documents        Procurement documents may include the following supporting
documents:
    Procurement contract awards
    Procurement statement of work
Agreements To administer the relevant contracts, you must fi rst include each contract as
an input to this process.
Approved Change Requests Approved change requests include changes that have been
approved to the contract, such as these:
    Modifications to deliverables
    Changes to the product or service of the project
    Changes in contract terms
    Termination for poor performance
Work Performance Reports Work performance reports refer to seller-related documents,
such as seller performance reports and technical documentation.
Work Performance Data Work performance data involves monitoring work results and examin-
ing the vendor's deliverables. This includes monitoring their work results against the project man-
agement plan and making sure that certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence.

Tools and Techniques of Control Procurements
Be familiar with the following tools and techniques of the Control Procurements process:
    Contract change control system
    Procurement performance reviews
274         Chapter 5      Monitoring and Controlling the Project



      Inspections and audits
      Performance reporting
      Payment systems
      Claims administration
      Records management system
Contract Change Control System The contract change control system describes the pro-
cesses needed to make contract changes. Since the contract is a legal document, it cannot be
changed without the agreement of all parties. It documents and includes the following items:
      Instructions for submitting changes
      Instructions for establishing the approval process
      Instructions outlining authority levels
      A tracking system for numbering the change requests and recording their status
      Procedures for dispute resolution
Figure 5.3 demonstrates where the contract change control system fits into the contract
change process.

                                          changes)



A formal process must be established to process and authorize (or deny) changes.


                   Authorization levels of the contract change control system are defined in
                   the organizational policies.



Procurement Performance Reviews Procurement reviews examine the contract terms and
seller performance. If the seller is not in compliance, action must be taken to either get
them back into compliance or terminate the contract. These reviews can be conducted at
the end of the contract's life cycle or at intervals during the contract period.
Inspections and Audits The purpose of inspections and audits is to determine whether
there are any deficiencies in the seller's product or service. These are conducted by the
buyer or a designated third party.
Performance Reporting Performance reporting involves providing managers and stake-
holders with information about the vendor's progress in meeting the contract objectives.
                                               Measuring Project Performance            275




Payment Systems Vendors submit seller invoices as an input to this process, and the pay-
ment system is the tool and technique used to issue payments.
Claims Administration Claims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and
managing contested changes to the contract. Contested changes usually involve a disagree-
ment about the compensation to the vendor for implementing the change. Here are some
things to know about claims administration:
    Contested changes are also known as disputes, claims, or appeals.
    Claims can be settled directly between the parties themselves, through the court sys-
    tem, or by a process called arbitration.



                 According to the PMBOK(R) Guide , when the parties cannot reach an
                 agreement themselves, they should use an alternative dispute-resolution
                 process (ADR), like arbitration. Also note that the preferred method of
                 settling disputes is negotiation.


Records Management System A records management system can be part of the project
management information system (PMIS) and involves the following:
    Documentation
    Policies
    Control functions
    Automated tools
Records management systems typically index documents for easy fi ling and retrieval.

Outputs of Control Procurements
Know the following five outputs of the Control Procurements process:
    Work performance information
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates
    Project documents updates
    Organizational process assets updates
Work Performance Information Work performance information reflects performance
data of the vendor that has been analyzed; this information will be used to make decisions
in regard to any corrective action or changes needed regarding the vendor's performance.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, work performance information may also include con-
tract compliance reports.
Change Requests Change requests may result from performing the Control Procurements
process and may include changes to plans and baselines. Changes may involve addressing
any vendor-related performance issues or may even include requests for contract changes.

aOE    Financial information
aOE    Inspection and audit results
aOE    Supporting schedules
aOE    Technical documentation
aOE    Approved and unapproved contract changes
Organizational Process Assets Updatesa* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, organizational
process assets updates typically include the following items:
      Correspondencea* a* Correspondence is information that needs to be communicated in
      writing to either the seller or the buyer, such as contract changes, audit results, notice of
      unsatisfactory performance, and notification of contract termination.
      Payment Schedules and Requestsa* a* Payment schedules and requests include information
      about paying the vendor on time and verifying that payment terms are met to warrant
      payment.
      Seller Performance Evaluation Documentationa* a* Seller performance evaluation is a
      written record of the seller's performance on the contract and is prepared by the buyer.
      It should include information about whether the seller successfully met contract dates
      and fulfilled the requirements of the contract and/or contract statement of work and
      whether the work was satisfactory.

                   Managing Changes to the Project Scope, Schedule, and Costs                      277




Managing Changes to the Project
Scope, Schedule, and Costs
Managing the triple constraints is an important part of monitoring and controlling a
project. This includes managing changes to the project scope, schedule, and costs, which
requires that the project management plan be updated as needed. The Validate Scope,
Control Scope, Control Schedule, and Control Costs processes focus on managing these
changes and uncovering existing variance to the plan. As the plan is updated with approved
changes, these changes should be communicated to the team to ensure that revised project
goals are met.


Validate Scope
Managing and reporting on project progress is the primary focus of the Monitoring and
Controlling processes. One of the Monitoring and Controlling processes is Validate Scope.
The primary purpose of the Validate Scope process is to formally accept completed deliv-
erables and obtain sign-off that the deliverables are satisfactory and meet stakeholders'
expectations. Validate Scope formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is primarily
concerned with the acceptance of work results.
   Figure 5.4 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Validate Scope process.



                    For more detailed information on the Validate Scope process, see Chapter
                    11, "Controlling Work Results," in PMP(R): Project Management Professional

Inputs of Validate Scope
Know the following inputs of the Validate Scope process:
      Project management plan
      Requirements documentation
      Requirements traceability matrix
      Verified deliverables
      Work performance data

Project Management Plan The scope management plan and scope baseline are used from
the project management plan. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement,
work breakdown structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary, all of which will be used by this
process.

Requirements Documentation To validate the scope of the project work, the project,
product, and technical requirements (and any others) must be included as an input to this
process.
Requirements Traceability Matrix The requirements traceability matrix tracks the
requirements throughout the project life cycle.
Verified Deliverables Verified Deliverables include deliverables that have been verified
through the Control Quality process. The quality team verifies that deliverables have been
completed correctly.
Work Performance Data Work performance data reflects raw data relating to the
deliverables, which is used to determine the degree of compliance against the requirements.
This can include the number and severity of nonconformities and/or total validation cycles
performed.


                   You should perform Validate Scope even if the project is canceled, to docu-
                   ment the degree to which the project was completed.



Tools and Techniques of Validate Scope
The Validate Scope process has two tools and techniques: inspection and group decision-
making techniques.

Inspection According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, inspection is concerned with making sure
the project work and deliverables meet the requirements and product acceptance criteria.
This may include ensuring, examining, and validation activities.
Group Decision-Making Techniques Group decision-making techniques, such as una-
nimity, majority, plurality, and dictatorship, are used in this process by the project team to
make a decision after performing validation activities.

Outputs of Validate Scope
The Validate Scope process results in four outputs:
Accepted Deliverablesa* a* The accepted deliverables output signifies that the deliverables
have been formally accepted and signed off by the customer or sponsor. This output, along
with related documentation, is then fed into the Close Project or Phase process at the
appropriate time.
Change Requestsa* a* Change requests address deliverables that were rejected by the customer
or sponsor and that therefore require defect repair.
Work Performance Informationa* a* Work performance information includes performance-
related information relating to deliverables, such as which deliverables have been completed
or accepted.
Project Documents Updatesa* a* Project documents updates typically include updates to the
following items:
aOE   Documents that define the product
aOE   Documents that report completion status


Control Scope
The Control Scope process involves monitoring the status of both the project and the
product scope, monitoring changes to the project and product scope, and monitoring
work results to ensure that they match expected outcomes. Any modification to the
agreed-upon WBS is considered a scope change. This means the addition or deletion
of activities or modifications to the existing activities on the WBS constitutes a project
scope change.
   Figure 5.5 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Control Scope
process.

      Project management plan
      Requirements documentation
      Requirements traceability matrix
      Work performance data
      Organizational process assets

Project Management Plan        The following components of the project management plan are
used in controlling scope:
      Scope management plan
      Scope baseline
      Change management plan
      Configuration management plan
      Requirements management plan
Requirements Documentation Information from the requirements documenta-
tion input used in this process includes the project, product, technical, and any other
requirements.

includes reviewing project performance measurements to determine whether there are vari-
ances in project scope and whether any corrective action is needed as a result of existing
variances.
                Managing Changes to the Project Scope, Schedule, and Costs                281




                 Unapproved or undocumented changes that sometimes make their way
                 into the project are referred to as scope creep.



Outputs of Control Scope
The Control Scope process results in the following outputs:
    Work performance information
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates
    Project documents updates
    Organizational process assets updates

Work Performance Information Work performance information documents the results
of comparing planned and actual scope performance. This information will be used when
making scope-related decisions.
Change Requests When scope changes are requested, all areas of the project should
be investigated to determine what the changes would impact. Change requests typically
involve the scope baseline or other components of the project management plan. Refer to
the Integrated Change Control Process to make sure change requests are processed for
review accordingly.
Project Management Plan Updates Depending on the approved changes, updates to the
project management plan may result in changes to the scope baseline or other project
baselines.
Project Documents Updates Updates to project documents that occur as a result of this
process typically include the requirements documentation and requirements traceability
matrix.
Organizational Process Assets Updates    The following updates are typically made to the
organizational process assets:
    Causes of variances
    Corrective actions taken
    Lessons learned


Control Schedule
The Control Schedule process involves determining the status of the project schedule, deter-
mining whether changes have occurred or should occur, and influencing and managing
schedule changes.

pleted activities. Schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) can be
used to determine the impact of the schedule variations and whether corrective action is
necessary.
In addition to EVM, performance reviews may also evaluate any trends identified, as well
as use the critical path method and/or critical chain method to determine schedule adjust-
ments needed.
Project Management Softwarea* a* Project management scheduling software can be used to
track actual versus planned activity dates and the impact of any existing changes.
Resource Optimization Techniquesa* a* Resource optimization techniques can leverage tech-
niques such as resource leveling to better distribute the work among resources. It considers
both resource availability and project time.
284a*...    Chapter 5a*  a* Monitoring and Controlling the Project



Modeling Techniquesa* a* Modeling techniques use what-if scenarios to bring the actual
schedule back in line with the planned schedule. To do this, scenarios are determined in
concert with risk analysis.
Leads and Lagsa* a* Leads and lags are adjusted during this process as a means of bringing the
actual schedule back in line with the schedule baseline.
Schedule Compressiona* a* Schedule compression techniques, such as fast-tracking and crashing,
are used to bring the actual schedule back in line with the planned schedule.
Scheduling Toola* a* Scheduling tools are used to perform schedule network analysis, which
results in an updated project schedule.

Control Costs
The Control Costs process monitors the project budget, manages changes to the cost
baseline, and records actual costs. It's concerned with monitoring project costs to prevent
unauthorized or incorrect costs from being included in the cost baseline. The activities are
among those included in this process:
    Monitoring changes to costs or the cost baseline and understanding variances from the
    baseline
    Monitoring change requests that affect cost and resolving them in a timely manner
    Informing stakeholders of approved changes and their costs

aOE   Work performance data
aOE   Organizational process assets
Project Management Plana* a* The project management plan includes the cost baseline
and the cost management plan that will be used by this process. The cost baseline com-
pares actual expenditures to date on the project to the baseline. The cost management
plan details how costs should be monitored and controlled throughout the life of the
project.
Project Funding Requirementsa* a* Project funding requirements include the periodic and
total project funding provided.
Work Performance Dataa* a* The work performance data input provides information
about the project's progress, including authorized and incurred costs and project
estimates.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The following organizational process assets are used by
this process:
aOE   Policies, procedures, guidelines, and reporting methods relating to cost

Tools and Techniques of Control Costs
You should be familiar with the following tools and techniques of the Control Costs
process:
aOE   Earned value management (EVM)
aOE   Forecasting
aOE   To-complete performance index (TCPI)
aOE   Performance reviews
aOE   Project management software
aOE   Reserve analysis
Earned Value Managementa* a* Performance measurement analysis can be accomplished by
using a technique called earned value management (EVM). EVM compares what you've
received or produced to what you've spent and establishes the cause and impact of vari-
ances to determine necessary corrective action. It is the most often used performance
measurement method.
EVM is performed on the work packages and the control accounts of the WBS. To perform
the EVM calculations, the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual cost (AC) are
collected. They are defined in Table 5.1 along with other terms associated with the EVM
technique.

Ta b l e 5 .1 a* a* Earned value management definitions


Term                      Definition

Planned value (PV)        The PV is the budgeted cost of work that has been authorized for
                          a schedule activity or WBS component during a given time period
                          or phase. These budgets are established during the Planning
                          processes. All PVs add up to the budget at completion (BAC).
                          PV is also known as budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS).

Earned value (EV)         EV is measured as budgeted dollars for the work performed. EV is
                          typically expressed as a percentage of the work completed com-
                          pared to the budget. It is also known as budgeted cost of work
                          performed (BCWP).

Actual cost (AC)          AC is the cost of completing the work component in a given time
                          period. AC measures the costs (direct, indirect, or other) that were
                          used to calculate the planned value. It is also known as actual cost
                          of work performed (ACWP).

Cost variance (CV)        CV determines whether costs are higher or lower than budgeted. A
                          negative CV means the project is over budget; a positive CV means
                          the project is under budget.

Cost performance          CPI measures the value of the work completed against actual cost.
index (CPI)               A CPI of 1 means the project is on budget; a CPI of >1 means the
                          project is under budget; a CPI of <1 means the project is over budget.

Schedule                  SV determines whether the work is ahead of or behind the planned
variance (SV)             schedule. A positive SV means the project is ahead of schedule; a
                          negative SV means the project is behind schedule.

Schedule                  SPI measures the schedule progress to date against the planned
performance index         progress. An SPI of 1 means the project is on schedule, an SPI of
(SPI)                     >1 means the project is ahead of schedule, and an SPI of <1 means
                          the project is behind schedule.

Estimate at               EAC is the expected total cost of a work component, a schedule
completion (EAC)          activity, or the project at its completion.

Estimate to               ETC is the amount of effort remaining based on completed and
complete (ETC)            expected activities.

Budget at                 BAC is the sum of all the budgets (or PVs) established.
completion (BAC)

Variance at               VAC is the difference between the budget at completion and the
completion (VAC)          estimate at completion.
288           Chapter 5        Monitoring and Controlling the Project



PV, AC, and EV measurements can be plotted graphically to show the variances between
them. If there are no variances in the measurements, all lines on the graph remain the same,
meaning that the project is progressing as planned. All of these measurements include
a cost component. Costs are displayed in an S curve because spending is minimal in the
beginning of the project, picks up steam toward the middle, and then tapers off at the end.
This means your earned value measurements will also take on the S curve shape. Figure 5.8
shows an example that plots these three measurements.


                     It is important to understand the definition of the earned value manage-
                     ment terms, and how to interpret the results. As part of the exam, you may
                     be asked to perform EVM calculations and answer questions based on the
                     results.

      Cost Variance Cost variance is one of the most popular variances that project manag-
      ers use, and it tells you whether your costs are higher than budgeted (with a resulting
      negative number) or lower than budgeted (with a resulting positive number). It measures
      the actual performance to date or during the period against what's been spent.
      Use this formula:
          CV = EV - AC
      Schedule Variance Schedule variance, another popular variance, tells you whether the
      schedule is ahead or behind what was planned for this period. This formula is most help-
      ful when you've used the critical path methodology to build the project schedule.
      Use this formula:

          SV = EV - PV
                Managing Changes to the Project Scope, Schedule, and Costsa*...             289




  Together, the CV and SV are known as efficiency indicators for the project and can be
  used to compare performance of all the projects in a portfolio.
  Cost and schedule performance indexes are primarily used to calculate performance
  efficiencies, and they're often used to help predict future project performance.
  Cost Performance Indexa* a* The cost performance index (CPI) measures the value of the
  work completed against actual cost. It is the most critical of all the EVM measurements
  according to the PMBOK(R) Guide because it tells you the cost efficiency for the work
  completed to date or at the completion of the project. As mentioned previously, if CPI
  is greater than 1, your spending is less than anticipated. If CPI is less than 1, you are
  spending more than anticipated for the work completed.
  Use this formula:
       CPI = EV / AC
  Schedule Performance Indexa* a* The schedule performance index (SPI) measures the
  progress to date against the progress that was planned. This formula should be used in
  conjunction with an analysis of the critical path activities to determine if the project will
  finish ahead of or behind schedule. As mentioned previously, if SPI is greater than 1, you
  are ahead of schedule. If SPI is less than 1, you are behind schedule.
  Use this formula:
       SPI = EV / PV



Day of the Exam

Interpreting the results of EVM formulas is important. When interpreting CV and SV,
remember that a positive number is good and a negative number is bad; when interpreting
CPI and SPI, remember that >1 is good and <1 is bad.

What is bad when it comes to costs and schedule? Being over budget and behind
schedule!



Forecastinga* a* Forecasting uses the information gathered to date and estimates the future
conditions or performance of the project based on what is known when the calculation is
performed.

One of the forecasting formulas used is called estimate at completion (EAC). EAC estimates
the expected total cost of a work component, a schedule activity, or the project at its com-
pletion. This is the probable final value for the work component (or project).
Use this formula:
    EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC
290a*...   Chapter 5a*  a* Monitoring and Controlling the Project



The bottom-up estimate to complete (ETC) is the amount of effort remaining based on the
activities completed to date and what is thought to occur in the future. Each estimate is
summed to come up with a total ETC.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are four EAC forecasting formulas (see Table 5.2),
which use budget at completion (BAC). BAC is the sum of all the budgets established for all
the work in the work package, control account, schedule activity, or project. It's the total
planned value for the work component or project. In addition to the bottom-up ETC, there
is one other formula for calculating ETC that you should be aware of for the exam. This is
also listed in Table 5.2.


Ta b l e 5 . 2 a* a* EAC and ETC forecasting


Forecast       Formula                         Description

EAC            EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC        This is used if the initial plan is no longer
                                               valid.

EAC            EAC = AC + BAC - EV             This formula calculates EAC based on the
                                               actual costs to date and the assumption that
                                               ETC work will be completed at the budgeted
                                               rate, thereby accepting previous performance
                                               (whether good or bad).

EAC            EAC = BAC / CPI                 This forecast assumes that future perfor-
                                               mance will be just like the past performance
                                               for the project.

EAC            EAC = AC + ((BAC - EV)          This formula assumes there is a negative cost
               / (CPI x SPI))                  performance to date and the project schedule
                                               dates must be met.

ETC            ETC = EAC - AC                  Use this formula when the work is expected
                                               to continue according to the plan.

ETC            ETC = Reestimate                Use this formula for predicting future cost
                                               variances that will not be similar to the types
                                               of variances you've seen to date. It reesti-
                                               mates from the bottom up.



To-Complete Performance Indexa* a* To-complete performance index (TCPI) is the pro-
jected performance level the remaining work of the project must achieve to meet the
BAC or EAC. It's calculated by dividing the work that's remaining by the funds that are
remaining.
                Managing Changes to the Project Scope, Schedule, and Costs                   291




The formula for TCPI when using the BAC is as follows:

    TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)


                 If the result of calculating the TCPI is less than 1, future work does not have
                 to be performed as efficiently as past performance.



When the BAC is no longer attainable, the project manager should calculate a new EAC,
and this new estimate becomes the goal you'll work toward once it's approved by manage-
ment. The formula for TCPI when EAC is your goal is as follows:

    TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)


                 If cumulative CPI falls below 1, all future project work must be performed
                 at the TCPI.



Performance Reviews Performance reviews compare cost performance over time and the
estimates of funds needed to complete the remaining work. The following three analysis
types are associated with performance reviews:
    Variance analysis calculates the difference between the budget at completion and the
    estimate at completion. To calculate this, use the variance at completion (VAC) formula:

        VAC = BAC - EAC
    Variance analysis works closely with the performance reviews technique. Aside from
    calculating VAC, variance analysis also focuses on the cause that led to a deviation
    from the baselines. By determining the cause of existing or potential variance, the
    project management team can then formulate an effective response through a change
    request.
    Trend analysis analyzes existing trends of project performance over time and whether
    performance is improving or declining.
    Earned value performance includes a comparison of the baseline plans to actual
    performance.
Project Management Software Project management software is used to monitor PV, EV,
and AC. Table 5.3 shows the formulas used to calculate values.
Reserve Analysis Reserve analysis is used to monitor and manage the amount of funds
within the contingency and management reserves. Reserve analysis is covered further later
in this chapter as part of controlling risks.

Exam Essentials

Name the purpose of the Validate Scope process.a* a* The purpose of Validate Scope is to
determine whether the work is complete and whether it satisfies the project objectives.

Describe the purpose of the Control Costs process.a* a* The Control Costs process is
concerned with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from
being included in the cost baseline.

Be able to describe earned value management techniques.a* a* Earned value management
(EVM) monitors the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual cost (AC) expended
to produce the work of the project. Cost variance (CV), schedule variance (SV), cost per-
formance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI) are the formulas used with
the EVM technique.

Know the purpose of the Control Scope and Control Schedule processes.a* a* The purpose of
the Control Scope process is to monitor project and product scope and manage changes
to the scope baseline. The purpose of the Control Schedule process is to monitor the sta-
tus of the project's progress and to manage changes to the schedule baseline.

Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Control Costs process.a* a* The tools and
techniques of Control Costs are earned value management, forecasting, to-complete
performance index, performance reviews, project management software, and reserve
analysis.




Ensuring Adherence to Quality
Standards
The Control Quality process is responsible for ensuring that project deliverables conform
to the quality standards as laid out in the quality management plan. This inspection can
be carried out by using several tools and techniques, such as control charts and testing,
in order to satisfy customer requirements.



Control Quality
The Control Quality process identifies the causes of poor product quality or processes
and makes recommendations to bring them up to the required levels. Quality control
is practiced throughout the project to identify and remove the causes of unacceptable
results.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project management teams should have a working
knowledge of statistical control processes in order to effectively analyze information as part
                                               Ensuring Adherence to Quality Standards                295




of quality control activities. In particular, project management teams should understand
the following:
    Prevention versus inspection. Prevention entails preventing errors from occurring,
    whereas inspection refers to catching and resolving defects before the product is
    released to the customer.
    Attribute sampling versus variable sampling. Attribute sampling refers to the measure-
    ments taken to determine whether they meet one of two options: conforming or non-
    conforming, or variable sampling rates measurements on a continuous scale to measure
    the degree of conformance.
    Tolerances versus control limits. Tolerances refer to a range of acceptable results,
    whereas control limits identify boundaries of what is considered to be statistically
    stable within a process.


                      As noted within Chapter 3, "Planning the Project," of this book, quality
                      management should be planned into the project, meaning that it is a pro-
                      active versus reactive activity. This helps to prevent errors from occurring
                      in the first place, rather than just resolving them by inspecting the product.

process.

Seven Basic Quality Tools Seven Basic Quality Tools used to control quality are similar
to those described in Chapter 3 as part of the Plan Quality Management process, meaning
that they have been incorporated into the quality management plan.
As a refresher, here is a brief explanation for each of the seven tools:
   Cause-and-Effect Diagrams Cause-and-effect diagrams, also known as Ishikawa or
   fi shbone diagrams, help identify root causes of issues. The idea is to determine the pos-
   sible issues or effects of various factors. A cause and its potential sub-causes are plot-
   ted on the diagram, which resembles the skeleton of a fish. Figure 5.10 shows what the
   cause-and-effect diagram may look like.

   Flowcharts Flowcharts are diagrams that show the logical steps that must be performed
   to accomplish an objective; they can also show how the individual elements of a system
   interrelate. Flowcharting helps identify where quality problems might occur on the project
   and how problems occur.
   Checksheets Checksheets, also known as tally sheets, are used as data-gathering
   checklists, such as gathering data during inspections.
   Pareto Diagrams Pareto diagrams are named after Vilfredo Pareto, who is credited for
   discovering the theory behind them, which is based on the 80/20 rule. The 80/20 rule as
298a*...       Chapter 5a*  a* Monitoring and Controlling the Project



    it applies to quality states that a small number of causes (20 percent) create the majority
    of the problems (80 percent). Pareto theorized that you get the most benefit by spending
    the majority of time fixing the most important problems.
    The information shown in Table 5.4 is plotted on an example Pareto diagram shown in
    Figure 5.11.

   Histogramsa* a* Histograms are bar charts that depict the distribution of variables over
   time. In the Control Quality process, the histogram usually depicts the attributes of the
   problem or situation.
   Control Chartsa* a* Control charts measure the results of processes over time and display
   the results in graph form. They provide a way of measuring variances to determine
   whether process variances are in or out of control.
   A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen
   and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Quality is usually
   maintained--or said to be in control--in plus or minus three standard deviations, also
   referred to as the upper and lower control limits.
   Figure 5.12 illustrates a sample control chart.

   Out-of-control variances should be investigated to determine whether corrective action
   is needed.
   For reference, know that standard deviation, or sigma, is equal to the following levels of quality:
     1 sigma is equal to 68.27 percent
     2 sigma is equal to 95.46 percent
     3 sigma is equal to 99.73 percent
     6 sigma is equal to 99.99 percent
   If the process measurements fall in the control limits, then 99.73 percent (3 sigma) of the
   parts going through the process will fall in an acceptable range of the mean.

      Scatter Diagramsa* a* Scatter diagrams use two variables, one called an independent
      variable, which is an input, and one called a dependent variable, which is an output.
      Scatter diagrams display the relationship between these two elements as points on a
      graph. This relationship is typically analyzed to prove or disprove cause-and-effect
      relationships.

Statistical Samplinga* a* Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from
the whole population and examining them to determine whether they fall in acceptable
variances. The quality management plan defines how to measure the results.
Inspectiona* a* Inspection involves physically looking at, measuring, or testing results to
determine whether they conform to the requirements or quality standards. Inspection
will tell you where problems exist and gives you the opportunity to correct them, thus
leading to quality improvements. Here's some additional information to know about
inspections:
aOE    Inspections might occur after the final product is produced or at intervals during the
       development of the product to examine individual components.
aOE    Inspections are also known as reviews and peer reviews.
aOE    Measurements that fall in a specified range are called tolerable results.
aOE    One inspection technique uses measurements called attributes. Attribute sampling is
       used to verify conformance and nonconformance to predefined specifications.
Approved Change Requests Reviewa* a* Change requests that have been approved and imple-
mented are reviewed to ensure that they were implemented correctly.

Updating the Risk Register
Identifying new risk, assessing old risks, and implementing the appropriate response strate-
gies should occur as an integral part of monitoring and controlling activities. This is impor-
tant to managing the impact of risks on the project and is carried out through the Control
Risks process.


Control Risks
The Control Risks process should be carried out throughout the project life cycle. In addition
to the activities just mentioned, this process is responsible for improving the risk management
processes in a number of ways:
aOE   Evaluating risk response plans that are put into action as a result of risk events
aOE   Monitoring the project for risk triggers
aOE   Reexamining existing risks to determine if they have changed or should be closed out
aOE   Monitoring residual risks
aOE   Reassessing project assumptions and determining validity
aOE   Ensuring that policies and procedures are followed
aOE   Ensuring that risk response plans and contingency plans are put into action appropri-
      ately and are effective
aOE   Ensuring that contingency reserves (for schedule and cost) are updated according to the
      updated risk assessment
aOE   Evaluating the overall effectiveness of the risk processes

                    PMP(R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth Edition.



Inputs of Control Risks
There are four inputs of the Control Risks process that you should know:
    Project management plan
    Risk register
    Work performance data
    Work performance reports

Project Management Plan The project management plan includes the risk management
plan, which provides the necessary information for carrying out this process.
Risk Register The risk register contains all the documented information of the identified
risks. It tracks and ranks individual risks, identifies the risk owner, describes risk triggers
and residual risks, and lists the response plans and strategies you should implement in the
event of an actual risk event. The risk register is fluid, meaning that additions, subtractions,
and updates will be made throughout the project.
Work Performance Data Work performance data is used in monitoring previously identi-
fied risks. It also includes information that may assist in the identification of risk triggers,
indicating that a risk event is about to occur.
Work Performance Reports Work performance reports are examined from the perspec-
tive of risk and include information such as status reports, performance measurements, and
forecasts.


Tools and Techniques of Control Risks
Know the following tools and techniques of the Control Risks process:
    Risk reassessment
    Risk audits
    Variance and trend analysis
    Technical performance measurement
    Reserve analysis
    Meetings

Risk Reassessment Periodic, scheduled reviews of identified risks, risk responses, and risk
priorities should occur during the project. The idea is to monitor risks and their status and
determine whether their consequences still have the same impact on the project objectives
as when they were originally planned.
304a*...    Chapter 5a*  a* Monitoring and Controlling the Project



Risk Auditsa* a* Risk audits are specifically used to examine the implementation of response
plans and their effectiveness at dealing with risks and their root causes. They are also used
to determine the effectiveness of the risk management processes.
Variance and Trend Analysisa* a* Variance and trend analysis looks at the planned results in
comparison with the actual results. Deviations found may indicate risk.
Technical Performance Measurementa* a* This tool and technique compares the technical
accomplishments of project milestones completed during the Executing processes to the
technical milestones defined in the Planning processes. Existing variations may indicate risk.
Reserve Analysisa* a* Reserve analysis compares the amount of contingency reserve remaining
to the amount of risk remaining in the project. The idea is to determine whether the contin-
gency reserve is sufficient.
Meetingsa* a* Meetings, typically held in the form of status meetings, are used as a means of
discussing risks with the project team.

Outputs of Control Risks
The Control Risks process produces the following five outputs:
aOE   Work performance information
aOE   Change requests
aOE   Project management plan updates
aOE   Project documents updates
aOE   Organizational process assets updates
Work Performance Informationa* a* Work performance information reflects the risk-related
information that has been gathered and analyzed as part of this process.
Change Requestsa* a* Recommended corrective actions or preventive actions may result
from contingency plans or workarounds that were implemented as part of the Control
Risks process. Change requests are submitted to the Perform Integrated Change Control
process.
Project Management Plan Updatesa* a* The project management plan may include updates to
the following documents, among others:
aOE   Schedule management plan
aOE   Cost management plan
aOE   Quality management plan
aOE   Procurement management plan
aOE   Human resource management plan
aOE   WBS within the scope baseline
aOE   Schedule baseline
aOE   Cost baseline
                                                     Assessing Corrective Actionsa*...         305




Project Documents Updatesa* a* The result of carrying out this process typically includes
updates to the risk register, assumptions log, and technical documentation.
As noted earlier, the risk register is typically updated as a result of carrying out this process,
and typically results in the following:
aOE   Addition of newly identified risks
aOE   Updates to the probability and impact, priority, response plans, and ownership of pre-
      viously identified risks
aOE   Outcome of the project's risks and their risk responses
Organizational Process Assets Updatesa* a* The following updates are typically made to the
organizational process assets:
aOE   Risk management templates
aOE   Risk breakdown structure (RBS)
aOE   Lessons learned



Exam Essentials

Describe the purpose of the Control Risks process.a* a* Control Risks involves identifying
and responding to new risks as they occur. Risk monitoring and reassessment should
occur throughout the life of the project.




Assessing Corrective Actions
As the need for corrective actions arise, the team may respond by submitting changes
requests. All change requests are reviewed by the change control board through the
Perform Integrated Change Control process. The issue log should be assessed regularly
for needed corrective action so that unresolved issues receive the appropriate follow-up.
Responses to open issues should be made by using the necessary tools and techniques so
that impact on the schedule, cost, and resources is minimized.


Perform Integrated Change Control
The Perform Integrated Change Control process, part of the Project Integration Management
Knowledge Area, manages the project's change requests. This process approves or rejects
changes and also manages changes to the deliverables. All change requests generated by other
processes are submitted to the Perform Integrated Change Control process for review before
implementation. Changes may involve corrective actions, preventive actions, and defect
repair.
306            Chapter 5           Monitoring and Controlling the Project



  According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the responsibilities of the Perform Integrated Change
Control process are primarily as follows:
      Influencing the factors that cause change control processes to be circumvented
      Promptly reviewing and analyzing change requests as well as reviewing and analyzing
      corrective and preventive actions
      Coordinating and managing changes across the project
      Maintaining the integrity of the project baselines and incorporating approved changes
      into the project management plan and other project documents
      Documenting requested changes and their impacts

Inputs of Perform Integrated Change Control
There are five inputs of the Perform Integrated Change Control process:
      Project management plan
      Work performance reports
      Change requests
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
                                                           Assessing Corrective Actionsa*...   307




Project Management Plana* a* The project management plan includes several documents that
will be used in this process, such as the approved schedule, budget, and scope. These docu-
ments will be used when reviewing submitted changes.
Work Performance Reportsa* a* Work performance reports include performance results,
such as status of deliverables, schedule progress, and reports containing earned value
management.
Change Requestsa* a* Change requests include requests that have been submitted for review
and approval, such as corrective action, preventive action, and defect repairs. All change
requests must be submitted in writing. Figure 5.16 reiterates that all change requests are
submitted as inputs into the Perform Integrated Change Control process.

Managing Changes

Modifications to the project are submitted in the form of change requests and managed
through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Here are some examples of fac-
tors that might cause change:

aOE   Project constraints
aOE   Stakeholder requests
aOE   Team member recommendations
aOE   Vendor issues



Enterprise Environmental Factorsa* a* Enterprise environmental factors used to carry out this
process include the PMIS, which includes the configuration management system and sched-
uling software.
308          Chapter 5       Monitoring and Controlling the Project



Organizational Process Assets The following organizational process assets are used by
this process:
      Change control and authorization procedures
      Process measurement database
      Configuration management knowledge base
      Project files


Tools and Techniques of Perform Integrated Change Control
The Perform Integrated Change Control process has three tools and techniques that you
will need to be familiar with:
Expert Judgment         The following sources of expert judgment may be used in this project:
      The project management team
      Key stakeholders
      Subject matter experts
      Consultants
      Industry or professional groups
      The project management office, if applicable
Meetings Change control meetings are meetings in which the change control board
reviews and makes decisions on submitted change requests. Roles and responsibilities
for a change control board, when they are needed on the project, are clearly defi ned and
agreed upon by appropriate stakeholders. The change control board is established to
review all change requests and is given the authority to approve or deny them. This author-
ity is defi ned by the organization. The decisions should be documented and reviewed by
stakeholders.
Change Control Tools Change control tools come in the form of manual or automated
systems that are used to help facilitate the change management process.


                      The PMBOK(R) Guide states that the change control board is made up of
                      a group of stakeholders who review and then approve, delay, or reject
                      change requests.


   You will also need to know about configuration management systems and change con-
trol systems, which are not listed as tools and techniques of the process but directly influ-
ence how the process is carried out.
Configuration Management System Configuration management is generally a subsystem
of the PMIS. It involves managing approved changes and project baselines. According to
                                                     Assessing Corrective Actions              309




the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following activities are associated with configuration change
management in this process:
   Configuration Identification Configuration identification describes the characteris-
   tics of the product, service, or result of the project. This description is the basis used to
   verify when changes are made and how they're managed.
   Configuration Status Accounting This includes the approved configuration iden-
   tification, the status of proposed changes, and the status of changes currently being
   implemented.
   Configuration Verification and Auditing Verification and audits are performed to
   determine whether the configuration item is accurate and correct and to make certain
   the performance requirements have been met.



                  It is the project manager's responsibility to manage changes and see that
                  organizational policies regarding changes are implemented.



Change Control System Change control systems are documented procedures that
describe how the deliverables of the project and associated project documentation are
controlled, changed, and approved. Here are some things to note about change control
systems:
    Often describe how to submit change requests and how to manage change requests
    Are usually subsystems of the configuration management system
    Track the status of change requests
    Ensure that changes that are not approved are tracked and filed in the change control
    log for future reference
    Define procedures that detail how emergency changes are approved
  In addition, you should know about implementing these two types of systems. The
PMBOK(R) Guide gives these three objectives for implementing and using configuration
management systems and change control processes:
    Establish a method to consistently identify changes, request changes to project baselines,
    and analyze and determine the value and effectiveness of the changes.
    Continuously authenticate and improve project performance by evaluating the impact
    of each change.
    Communicate all change requests, whether approved, rejected, or delayed, to all the
    stakeholders.
  Figure 5.17 provides a brief overview of the configuration management and change
control systems.

                    together identify, document, and control the changes to the performance
                    baseline.



Outputs of Perform Integrated Change Control
Know the four outputs of the Perform Integrated Change Control process:
Approved Change Requests This output reflects the list of submitted changes that have
been approved by the change control board.
Change Log A change log is fi rst created out of this process and then updated regu-
larly throughout the project's life cycle. Change logs typically include a log of all changes
requested, along with updates and decisions made on those changes.
Project Management Plan Updates Project management plan updates are made to reflect
changes that have been approved or rejected after going through the Perform Integrated
Change Control process. This may include changes to the following documents:
      Baselines
      Subsidiary management plans
Project Documents Updates Project documents updated may include updates to any docu-
ments impacted by approved or rejected changes as well as the change request log, which
will reflect the status update of the change requests.

Exam Essentials

Describe the purpose of the Perform Integrated Change Control process.a* a* Perform
Integrated Change Control is performed throughout the life of the project and involves
reviewing all the project change requests, establishing a configuration management and
change control process, and approving or denying changes.

Be able to define the purpose of a configuration management system.a* a* Configuration
management systems are documented procedures that describe the process for sub-
mitting change requests, the processes for tracking changes and their disposition, the
processes for defining the approval levels for approving and denying changes, and the
process for authorizing the changes. Change control systems are generally a subset of
the configuration management system. Configuration management also describes the
characteristics of the product of the project and ensures accuracy and completeness of
the description.

Be able to describe the purpose of a change control board.a* a* The change con-
trol board has the authority to approve or deny change requests. Its authority is
defined and outlined by the organization. A change control board is made up of
stakeholders.




Communicating Project Status
Communicating project status occurs throughout activities related to the Executing
and Monitoring and Controlling processes, as seen throughout this chapter, as well as
in Chapter 4, "Executing the Project," of this book. While project reports help to align
the project with the business needs, it is through the Control Communications process
that the project manager ensures that communication requirements of stakeholders
are met.



Control Communications
The Control Communications process is responsible for monitoring and controlling com-
munications throughout the duration of the project. It is through this process that the proj-
ect manager ensures that the communication requirements of stakeholders are met, along
with their needs and expectations.
   Figure 5.18 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Control
Communications process.

Inputs of Control Communications
The Control Communications process includes the following inputs:
      Project management plan
      Project communications
      Issue log
      Work performance data
      Organizational process assets
Project Management Plan The project management plan contains the project management
baseline data used to monitor and compare results. Deviations from this data are reported
to management.
Project Communications Project communications are produced as the project work is
executed. Through this process, communications are monitored; the project manager may
take action as needed based on this communication including releasing information to
stakeholders.
Issue Log As the work proceeds forward, the project manager monitors issues docu-
mented within the issue log, to ensure that resolution is reached.
Work Performance Data Work performance data is collected throughout the Monitoring
and Controlling processes. Information such as status of deliverables, schedule, and costs is
used in the Control Communications process.

aOE   Requirements relating to communication and/or security

Tools and Techniques of Control Communications
You should know the following three tools and techniques of the Control Communications
process:
aOE   Information management systems
aOE   Expert judgment
aOE   Meetings
Information Management Systemsa* a* The information management system can be used by
the project manager to capture, store, and disseminate information to project stakeholders.
These systems may be complex or could be as simple as a spreadhsheet.
Expert Judgmenta* a* Expert judgment is key to assessing project communication and infor-
mation to understand its impact and then make decisions accordingly.
Meetingsa* a* Meetings are typically used in the Control Communications process to facili-
tate discussion among project team members and other relevant subject matter experts.
Examples of discussions that occur as part of this process include the analysis and decision
making of issue resolution and dissemination of information.

Outputs of Control Communications
The Control Communications process results in five outputs:
aOE   Work performance information
aOE   Change requests
aOE   Project management plan updates
aOE   Project documents updates
aOE   Organizational process assets updates
Work Performance Informationa* a* Work performance information consists of informa-
tion that has been analyzed or summarized as a result of carrying out this process. As this
information is captured and documented, it can then be distributed to the appropriate
stakeholders.
Change Requestsa* a* The following changes may be requested as a result of carrying out this
process:
aOE   Recommended corrective actions to bring performance in alignment with the project
      management plan

Exam Essentials

Describe the purpose of the Control Communications process.a* a* Control Communications
is responsible for monitoring and controlling communications throughout the duration of
the project, and ensuring that the communication requirements, needs, and expectations
of stakeholders are met.




Controlling Stakeholder Engagement
As the project moves forward, the project manager will need to continuously and care-
fully monitor the level of stakeholder engagement to ensure that expectations are well
gauged and met. Stakeholders who are passive and not actively engaged may negative
impact the project at a later point, such as introducing new requirements that could have
been addressed earlier in the project life cycle. The project manager may need to adjust
the strategy for managing stakeholder expectations and engagement levels as the project
progresses.


Control Stakeholder Engagement
The Control Stakeholder Engagement process belongs to the Project Stakeholder
Management Knowledge Area, and is responsible for monitoring stakeholder relationships
and adjusting the stakeholder management plan as a result of their engagement. As a result
of this process, stakeholder engagement becomes more efficient and effective.

Inputs of Control Stakeholder Engagement
There are four inputs of the Control Stakeholder Engagement process:
    Project management plan
    Issue log
    Work performance data
    Project documents
Project Management Plan The project management plan contains the stakeholder man-
agement plan, which guides the project manager in carrying out the process.
Issue Log The issue log documents all issues identified, as well as updates and progress on
their resolution. Issues may need to be updated as this process is performed.
Work Performance Data Work performance data includes measurements captured
throughout the Monitoring and Controlling processes. Examples of data that may be used
as part of this process include what work has been completed, change requests submitted,
and technical performance measurements.
Project Documents Documents typically referred to as part of the Control Stakeholder
Engagement process include the schedule, stakeholder register, issue and change logs, and
project communications.

Tools and Techniques of Control Stakeholder Engagement
The Control Stakeholder Engagement process has three tools and techniques that you will
need to be familiar with:
Information Management Systemsa* a* Information management systems can be used to
capture, store, and disseminate information to stakeholders as needed. Using these systems,
the project manager can actively monitor the level of stakeholder engagement as part of this
process.
Expert Judgmenta* a* As the project progresses forward, changes to the list of stakeholders
may occur. Expert judgment may be needed to reassess stakeholders. Expertise sought
may include individuals such as senior management, other project managers, or those with
specialized knowledge in specific areas.
Meetingsa* a* Meetings are often used to bring experts together to analyze information
obtained when carrying out a process and making decisions based on this information.



Day of the Exam

Notice that nearly all processes that fall within the Monitoring and Controlling pro-
cess group have work performance data as an input and work performance infor-
mation as an output. The only exception to this rule are the two Monitoring and
Controlling processes that fall within the Project Integration Management Knowl-
edge Area.

Identifying trends across the project management processes, such as this one, will help
you better understand and break down questions on the day of the exam.



Outputs of Control Stakeholder Engagement
Know the five outputs of the Control Stakeholder Engagement process:
Work Performance Informationa* a* As with other processes that fall in the Monitoring
and Controlling process group, performance data that has been captured and analyzed is
documented as an output. This information is critical in making decisions at the project
level.
Change Requestsa* a* As the process is carried out, corrective actions or preventive actions
may be needed. These are submitted in the form of change requests, which are then fun-
neled into the change control process.
Project Management Plan Updatesa* a* Various subsidiary plans, such as the stakeholder
management plan and change management plan, may need to be updated as a result of
carrying out this process.

Project Documents Updatesa* a* Project documents typically updated as a result of controlling
stakeholder engagement include the stakeholder register and the issue log.
Organizational Process Assets Updatesa* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following
updates are typically made to the organizational process assets:
aOE   Stakeholder notifications and feedback
aOE   Project reports and presentations
aOE   Project records
aOE   Lessons learned documentation



Exam Essentials

Describe the purpose of the Control Stakeholder Engagement process.a* a* The Control
Stakeholder Engagement process is responsible for monitoring stakeholder relationships
and adjusting the stakeholder management plan as a result of their engagement.




Bringing the Processes Together
In this chapter, you learned all about the processes that fall in the Monitoring and
Controlling process group. If anything is amiss, the processes in this group work together
to bring the project back in line with the project management plan.
    In addition to correcting any differences between the actual work and the project man-
agement plan, the Monitoring and Controlling process group is responsible for preventive
actions. During these processes, changes are verified and managed, and the status of identi-
fied risks is monitored in order to manage hurdles as soon as they arise. This process group
is the project's gatekeeper.
    Figure 5.20 summarizes the objectives in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.

  In total, the Monitoring and Controlling process group contains 11 processes, covering
nearly all of the Knowledge Areas:
aOE    Project Integration Management
aOE    Project Scope Management
aOE    Project Time Management
aOE    Project Cost Management
aOE    Project Quality Management
aOE    Project Communications Management
aOE    Project Risk Management
aOE    Project Procurement Management
aOE    Project Stakeholder Management
   We will review the process interactions that occur in each Knowledge Area during the
Monitoring and Controlling process group. This will help you understand how the pro-
cesses work together.


Project Integration Management Knowledge
Area Review
Two key processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group belong to the
Project Integration Management Knowledge Area. Figure 5.21 shows how the proj-
ect work is tracked and regulated as part of this Knowledge Area and how all project
changes are approved or rejected. Changes are reviewed by the integrated change control
system, which determines whether the changes are necessary and in the best interest of
the project.

Project Scope Management Knowledge
Area Review
As you may recall, scope documents are necessary to keep the project focused by provid-
ing it with boundaries and defining exactly what it set out to accomplish (no more, no
less). The two processes in the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area fall in the
Monitoring and Controlling process group and ensure that the project is in line with the
defined requirements.
   Figure 5.22 shows how verified deliverables are formally accepted during this
phase and how the project and product scope are monitored and managed. Changes
made to the project scope are carefully watched. If something does not align with the
project's defined requirements, then recommended changes are made. Performance
measurements are also recorded and are used in project quality processes and project
communications.

Project Time Management Knowledge
Area Review
Only one process from the Project Time Management Knowledge Area occurs in the
Monitoring and Controlling process group. This process is responsible for monitoring and
controlling changes to the project schedule. Here, we are also concerned with monitoring
the status of the project so that progress updates can be made. Performance measurements
emerge from this step. The performance measurements will be important to monitoring and
controlling quality and communications.
   As Figure 5.23 shows, changes are recommended based on the progress and status of the
project schedule.

Project Cost Management Knowledge Area Review
During the monitoring and controlling of project costs, we use the budget developed during
the execution of the project work. Figure 5.24 shows the single cost-related process in the
Monitoring and Controlling process group.

                           information            forecasts             changes


   As you may recall during our review of this process earlier in this chapter, the following
items are generated out of this process:
aOE   Budget forecasts
aOE   Performance measurements, which will be used for monitoring and controlling quality
      and communications (similar to the performance data of the project schedule)
aOE   Recommended changes to bring the budget back in line with the project management
      plan as needed
                                                   Bringing the Processes Together        321




   Generating the budget forecasts and performance measurements involves the use of
earned value management (EVM), which itself includes several formulas. Although we
won't go through the formulas and calculations here, you'll need to remember the calcula-
tions and various performance measurements in EVM:
    Planned value (PV)
    Earned value (EV)
    Actual cost (AC)
    Schedule variance (SV)
    Cost variance (CV)
    Schedule performance index (SPI)
    Cost performance index (CPI)
    Estimate at completion (EAC)
    Estimate to complete (ETC)
    To-complete performance index (TCPI)



                 For a review of the cost formulas, see "Control Costs" earlier in this
                 chapter.




Project Quality Management Knowledge Area Review
Monitoring and controlling quality involves monitoring and recording the results of quality
activities that have been executed in addition to assessing performance. Figure 5.25 shows
how several items carry out this purpose.

                                            and assess
                                           performance

322a*...    Chapter 5a*  a* Monitoring and Controlling the Project



   The results of the single quality-related process in the Monitoring and Controlling
process group include the following items:
aOE   Quality measurements, which are submitted back into the Perform Quality Assurance
      process (which is part of the Executing process group)
aOE   Verified deliverables and changes, to make sure the results of the project work are
      correct
aOE   Recommended changes, which are made for changes or deliverables that have been
      rejected from a quality standpoint
   To generate these results, you may recall that several tools and techniques were
used. You should be familiar with the Seven Basic Quality Tools for the exam. Also
note that those conducting quality control activities should have a working knowledge
of sampling and probability. At the least, project teams should be familiar with the
following:
aOE   Prevention
aOE   Attribute sampling
aOE   Tolerances and control limits


Project Communications Management Knowledge
Area Review
Monitoring and controlling project communications relies on performance informa-
tion and budget forecasts; these are collected and distributed as performance reports.
The recipients of these reports are outlined in the communications management plan.
Figure 5.26 displays the results of the communications process in the Monitoring and
Controlling process group.

      This process generates the following items:
aOE    Measurements of the project's progress and forecasts
aOE    Any recommended changes made to bring the project back in line with the project
       management plan, implement preventive actions, or accommodate changes that were
       made to the product or project as a result of managing stakeholder expectations

Project Risk Management Knowledge Area Review
The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area has only one process that falls in the
Monitoring and Controlling process group. As you may recall, this single process accomplishes
a lot of things. Within this risk-related process, we will carry out the following actions:
aOE    Implement the risk response plans, which were developed in the Planning process group
aOE    Evaluate the effectiveness of the plans
aOE    Monitor the identified risks
aOE    Identify new risks
aOE    Evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management processes
      As shown in Figure 5.27, carrying through these actions results in the following:
aOE    Actual outcomes of the identified risks
aOE    Newly identified risks
aOE    The documenting and recording of the risk outcomes for use by future projects
aOE    The documenting and recording of the risk audits that were conducted to evaluate the
       effectiveness of the risk response plans and the risk management processes
aOE    Any recommended changes to bring the project back in line with the project manage-
       ment plan as well as corrective actions and preventive actions (typically includes the
       implementation of contingency plans and workaround plans)

Project Procurement Management Knowledge
Area Review
During monitoring and controlling of the project, vendor relationships and performance
are managed and monitored. Figure 5.28 shows what occurs in the single procurement-
related process that falls in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.

                                           Manage and monitor
                                           vendor relationships
                                           and performance

                                               changes


      The following information is used throughout this process:
aOE    Procurement information, such as the procurement contracts and any documents relat-
       ing to the procurements being administered
aOE    Vendor performance information, including internal performance reports and reports
       generated by the vendors
aOE    Approved changes, which typically involve changes to the contract terms and
       conditions
aOE    The project management plan, which contains the procurement management plan
   As a result of the Control Procurements process, recommended changes are made to
bring vendor performance and progress back in line with the project management plan.


Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge
Area Review
As part of managing stakeholder expectations, the project manager must actively monitor
the engagement of stakeholders throughout the project's life cycle. This occurs through
the single Monitoring and Controlling process that falls within the Project Stakeholder
                                                  Bringing the Processes Togethera*...   325

                                              changes

   Keep in mind that the Monitoring and Controlling process group's purpose is given
away by its title. The processes in this process group are concerned with making sure the
project (performance and status) is moving along as planned. In the event that this is not
the case, corrective actions are issued and proactive measures are taken through preventive
actions.

Chapter   Closing the Project

 6        The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Closing the Project performance
          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

          aoefi Obtain final acceptance of the project deliverables from
                relevant stakeholders in order to confirm that project
                scope and deliverables were achieved.

          aoefi Transfer the ownership of deliverables to the assigned
                stakeholders in accordance with the project plan in order
                to facilitate project closure.

          aoefi Obtain financial, legal, and administrative closure using
                generally accepted practices and policies in order to
                Acommunicate formal project closure and ensure transfer
                of liability.

          aoefi Prepare and share the final project report according to the
                communications management plan in order to document
                and convey project performance and assist in project
                evaluation.

          aoefi Collate lessons learned that were documented
                throughout the project and conduct a comprehensive
                project review in order to update the organization's
                knowledge base.

          aoefi Archive project documents and materials using gener-
                ally accepted practices in order to comply with statutory
                requirements and for potential use in future projects and
                internal/external audits.

          aoefi Obtain feedback from relevant stakeholders using appro-
                priate tools and techniques and based on the stakeholder
                management plan in order to evaluate their satisfaction.
                               Closing is the fi nal process group of the five project manage-
                               ment process groups and accounts for 7 percent of the ques-
                               tions on the PMP(R) exam. The primary purpose of Closing
is to formally complete the project, phase, or contractual obligations. Finalizing all of the
activities across the project management process groups accomplishes this.
    By the end of the processes that make up the Closing process group, the completion of
the defi ned processes across all of the process groups will have been verified. Don't forget
that the closeout preparations begin early in the project with the clear and welldefi ned
success criteria of the project.


                  The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and descrip-
                  tions of the project management process groups and related materials
                  and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide to the
                  Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide), Fifth Edition
                  (PMI(R), 2013).




Obtaining Final Acceptance
All projects must be formally closed out regardless of the reasons for closure (such as suc-
cessful completion or early termination). According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following
typically occurs during formal closing of the project or project phase:
    Obtaining formal acceptance by the customer or sponsor
    Closing out procurement contracts
    Conducting phaseend or postproject reviews
    Updating the organizational process assets, which includes documenting lessons
    learned and archiving project documents in the project management information
    system (PMIS)
    Recording the impacts of tailoring to any process
    Performing assessments of the project team members
   These activities are carried out through the Close Project or Phase process and the Close
Procurements process.
                                                          Obtaining Final Acceptance                333




Close Project or Phase
The Close Project or Phase process is concerned with gathering project records and dissemi-
nating information to formalize the acceptance of the product, service, or result. The pro-
cess belongs to the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area. Here are additional
notes about the process you should know:
    It involves analyzing the project management processes to determine their effectiveness.
    It documents lessons learned concerning the project processes.
    It archives all project documents for historical reference. You can probably guess that
    Close Project or Phase belongs to the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area
    since this process touches so many areas of the project.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, every project requires closure, and the completion
of each project phase requires project closure as well. The Close Project or Phase process is
performed at the close of each project phase and at the close of the project.
   Figure 6.1 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Close Project or
Phase process.

                    in PMP (R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Eighth
                    Edition (Sybex, 2016).


Inputs of Close Project or Phase
For the exam, know the three inputs of the Close Project or Phase process:
Project Management Plan To consider the project closed, the project management plan
will be reviewed by the project manager to ensure completion of the deliverables.
334a*...    Chapter 6a*  a* Closing the Project



Accepted Deliverablesa* a* Accepted deliverables are an output of the Validate Scope pro-
cess. This input is necessary to determine whether all deliverables have been successfully
completed.
Organizational Process Assetsa* a* The following organizational process assets are typically
used in this process:
aOE   Guidelines for closing out the project or project phase
aOE   Historical information and lessons learned
aOE   Project closure reports


Tools and Techniques of Close Project or Phase
The Close Project or Phase process has three tools and techniques: expert judgment, ana-
lytical techniques, and meetings.
Expert Judgmenta* a* Subject matter experts can help assure that the process is performed
according to the organization's standard and to project management standards. Experts
typically include other project managers, the project management office, and organizations
such as PMI(R) or other technical organizations that publish standards and resources.
Analytical Techniquesa* a* Analytical techniques may be used to ensure that closure activi-
ties are ready to be performed and are performed correctly. Regression analysis and trend
analysis are two examples of techniques provided by the PMBOK(R) Guide.
Meetingsa* a* Meetings are often used as a means of bringing experts together. Meetings may
occur in a variety of formats, such as inperson or virtual.

Outputs of Close Project or Phase
The two outputs that result from carrying out the Close Project or Phase process are as
follows:
Final Product, Service, or Result Transitiona* a* Final product, service, or result transition
refers to the acceptance of the product and the turnover to the customer or into operations.
This is where information is distributed that formalizes project completion.
Organizational Process Assets Updatesa* a* The following organizational process assets are
typically updated as a result of the Close Project or Phase process:
aOE   Project files, such as the project planning documents, change records and logs, and
      issue logs
aOE   Project or phase closure documents, which include documentation showing that the
      project or phase is completed and that the transfer of the product of the project to the
      organization has occurred
aOE   Project closure reports
aOE   Historical information, which is used to document the successes and failures of the
      project
                                                       Obtaining Final Acceptance               335




Close Procurements
The Close Procurements process is primarily concerned with completing and settling the
terms of the procurement. It supports the Close Project or Phase process by determining
whether the work described in the procurement documentation or contract was completed
accurately and satisfactorily, which is referred to as product verification.
   The Close Procurements process also accomplishes the following:
    Updating and archiving records for future reference
    Completing all terms or conditions for completion and closeout specified within the
    procurement contracts including settlement of all financial obligations
    Documenting and verifying project outcomes
   Figure 6.2 shows the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Close Procurements
process.

                   Chapter 12 of the PMP(R): Project Management Professional Exam Study
                   Guide, Eighth Edition.



Inputs of Close Procurements
The Close Procurements process has a total of two inputs that you should be familiar with:
project management plan and procurement documents.
Project Management Plan The project management plan contains the procurement
management plan, which will be used to guide and carry out this process.
336a*...      Chapter 6a*  a* Closing the Project



Procurement Documentsa* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following documents
from within the procurement documentation input are collected, indexed, and filed:
aOE   Contract schedule
aOE   Scope
aOE   Quality
aOE   Cost performance
aOE   Contract change documentation
aOE   Payment records
aOE   Inspection results

Tools and Techniques of Close Procurements
For the exam, be familiar with the three tools and techniques of the Close Procurements
process:
Procurement Auditsa* a* Procurement audits are structured reviews that span all of the pro-
curement processes. The primary purpose of these audits is to identify lessons learned by
examining the procurement processes to determine areas of improvement and to identify
flawed processes or procedures.
Procurement Negotiationsa* a* According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the final equitable settle-
ment of all outstanding issues, claims, and disputes by negotiation is the primary goal in
all procurement relationships. Sometimes when settlement cannot be achieved through
direct negotiation, some form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), including mediation
or arbitration, may be explored. Reaching a negotiated settlement through the aid of ADR
techniques is the most favorable way to resolve a dispute.
Records Management Systema* a* The records management system contains processes, control
functions, and automation tools to help manage contract and procurement documentation
and records.

Outputs of Close Procurements
You should know the two outputs of the Close Procurements process, which are closed pro-
curements and organizational process assets updates.
Closed Procurementsa* a* Closed procurements are the formal acceptance and closure of the
procurements. As Figure 6.3 illustrates, this output satisfies the terms and conditions speci-
fied within the contract; it is also included within the procurement management plan.

Organizational Process Assets Updatesa* a* Updates to the organizational process assets, as a
result of carrying out this process, are typically made to the following items:
aOE   Procurement file, which includes all of the procurement records and supporting
      Adocuments
aOE   Deliverable acceptance, which is a formal written notice from the buyer that the
      Adeliverables are acceptable and satisfactory or have been rejected
aOE   Lessons learned documentation


Exam Essentials

Be able to name the primary activity of the Closing processes.a* a* The primary activity of
the Closing processes is to distribute information that formalizes project completion.

Be able to describe when the Close Project or Phase process is performed.a* a* Close Project
or Phase is performed at the close of each project phase and at the close of the project.

Name the primary purpose of the Close Procurements process.a* a* The Close Procurements
process is primarily concerned with completing and settling the terms of the procurements.




Transferring Ownership
The acceptance and turnover of the product to the customer or into operations typically
involves a formal signoff indicating that those signing accept the product of the project.
This occurs as a result of carrying out the Close Project or Phase process, which was dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter.


Exam Essentials

Be able to name the process responsible for transferring ownership of the project's final
product, service, or result.a* a* The Close Project or Phase process is responsible for trans-
ferring the final product, service, or result of the project to the customer or transitioning it
into operation.




Obtaining Financial, Legal, and
Administrative Closure
Aside from the two closing processes, there are a few additional items to note about the
Closing process group and finalizing the project's closure. To start, project or phase closure
is carried out in a formal manner and requires that financial, legal, and administrative
338a*...    Chapter 6a*  a* Closing the Project



closure be obtained. This is important to communicating formal closure and to ensuring
that no further liability exists after the project has been completed.
   It's important to note that a project can move into the Closing process group for several
reasons:
aOE   It's completed successfully.
aOE   It's canceled or killed prior to completion.
aOE   It evolves into ongoing operations and no longer exists as a project.


Formal Project Endings
Aside from these common reasons that result in a project moving into the Closing pro-
cesses, there are four formal types of project endings that you should be familiar with:
addition, starvation, integration, and extinction.
Additiona* a* A project that evolves into ongoing operations is considered a project that ends
because of addition, moving into its own ongoing business unit. Once it experiences this
transition, it no longer meets the definition of a project.
Starvationa* a* Starvation occurs when resources are cut off from a project prior to the
completion of all the requirements. This results in an unfinished project. Starvation often
occurs as a result of shifting priorities, a customer's cancellation of an order or request, the
project budget being reduced, or key resources quitting.
Integrationa* a* Integration occurs when the resources of a project (such as people, equipment,
property, and supplies) are distributed to other areas in the organization or are assigned to
other projects. In other words, resources have been reassigned or redeployed, causing an
end to the project.
Extinctiona* a* Extinction occurs when a project has completed and stakeholders have
accepted the end result. This is the best type of ending because the project team has com-
pleted what they set out to achieve.
   In all cases, it's important to retain good documentation that describes why a proj-
ect ended early. Performing a project review in these cases is important to retaining
key details and specifics regarding why a project ended before all requirements were
completed.


Trends
Another notable piece of information involves stakeholder influence and cost trends that
occur during project closure. Stakeholders tend to have the least amount of influence during
the Closing processes, while project managers have the greatest amount of influence. Costs
are significantly lower during the Closing processes because the majority of the project
work and spending has already occurred.
                            Obtaining Financial, Legal, and Administrative Closurea*...      339




Administrative Closure
As part of administrative closure, resources will need to be released and the administrative
closure procedures carried out.


Release Resources
Although releasing project team members is not an official process, you will release
your project team members at the conclusion of the project, and they will go back to
their functional managers or be assigned to a new project if you're working in a A
matrixtype organization. The release of project resources is addressed within the
staff release plan.
   The staff release plan is one of the items within the staffing management plan, which in
turn is included within the human resource management plan, a subsidiary project man-
agement plan. The following are the primary items covered in the staff release plan, which
includes the release of resources not just at the end of the project, but in general at any
point within the project:
aOE    Outlines the method for resource release
aOE    Defines when resources are to be released
   Once resources are released, the costs of the resources are no longer charged to the proj-
ect. The staff release plan helps mitigate human resource risks that may occur during or at
the conclusion of the project.



Perform Administrative Closure
Administrative closure procedures involve the following:
aOE    Collecting all the records associated with the project
aOE    Analyzing the project success (or failure)
aOE    Documenting and gathering lessons learned
aOE    Properly archiving project records
aOE    Documenting the project team members' and stakeholders' roles and responsibilities:
       aOE   Approval requirements of the stakeholders for project deliverables and changes to
             deliverables
       aOE   Confirmation that the project meets the requirements of the stakeholders, custom-
             ers, and sponsor
       aOE   Documented actions to verify that the deliverables have been accepted and exit cri-
             teria have been met
      Figure 6.4 shows the elements of the administrative closure procedures.

Exam Essentials

Be familiar with key trends projects experience during project closure.a* a* Notable trends dur-
ing project closure are that stakeholders have the least amount of influence whereas project
managers have the greatest amount of influence and that costs are significantly lower.

Be able to name the four formal types of project closure.a* a* The four formal types of proj-
ect closure are addition, starvation, integration, and extinction.

Know when and how resources are released from the project.a* a* Project resources are
primarily released as part of finalizing project closure. The release of project resources is
addressed in the staff release plan.

Be familiar with the purpose of the administrative closure procedures.a* a* Administrative
closure involves collecting all the records associated with the project, analyzing the proj-
ect success or failure, documenting and gathering lessons learned, properly archiving
project records, and documenting roles and responsibilities.




Distributing the Final Project Report
As part of formally closing out a project, the project manager will need to create and dis-
tribute the final project report. This generally occurs as part of the Close Project or Phase
process, where administrative details are addressed. The final project report should include
                                                    Archiving Project Documentsa*...         341




all project closure-related details, project variances, and any issues. The project manager
should ensure that final project status is distributed to the stakeholders.


Exam Essentials

Be familiar with the information distributed as part of the final project report.a* a* The
final project report distributed by the project manager to stakeholders includes project
Aclosure-related information, project variances, and issues.




Collating Lessons Learned
One of the recurring themes communicated across the PMBOK(R) Guide is the proactive
nature of the project manager, expressed by their actions. An example of being proactive is
documenting lessons learned as part of the organizational process assets.
   Documenting lessons learned, as mentioned previously, focuses on capturing what went
well within the project, what didn't go well, and what can be improved. Although lessons
learned are recorded throughout the life of the project, holding a final review with the proj-
ect team before the team is released at the end of the project is essential. This information
can be captured through a comprehensive project review with stakeholders and then can be
added to the organization's knowledge base.
   Documenting lessons learned occurs as part of the Close Project or Phase process,
through the organizational process assets updates output.


Exam Essentials

Be familiar with how lessons learned are captured at the end of the project and what
information is recorded.a* a* At the end of the project, lessons learned can be documented
by holding a comprehensive project review with stakeholders. The focus of lessons
learned includes documenting what went well within the project, what didn't go well, and
what can be improved.




Archiving Project Documents
As part of the Close Project or Phase process, project documents are archived. This occurs
through the organizational process assets updates output, which makes the historical docu-
ments available for future reference and use. Archiving project documents provides the fol-
lowing benefits:
aOE   Retaining organizational knowledge
aOE   Ensuring that statutory requirements, if applicable, are adhered to

Measuring Customer Satisfaction
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project success is measured by the following criteria:
aOE   Product and project quality
aOE   Timeliness
aOE   Budget compliance
aOE   Degree of customer satisfaction
   Customer satisfaction is an important goal you're striving for in any project. If your
customer is satisfied, it means you've met their expectations and delivered the product or
service as defined within the planning processes. Customer satisfaction can be measured
through quality management, which in part is concerned with making sure that customer
requirements are met. This is done through understanding, evaluating, defining, and man-
aging customer and stakeholder expectations.
   As Figure 6.5 illustrates, modern quality management achieves customer satisfaction
in part by ensuring that the project accomplishes what it set out to do (conformance to
requirements) and that it satisfies real needs (fitness for use).

Bringing the Processes Together
The Closing process group consists of only two processes that work toward closing out the
project or project phase. Before closing out the project, the project manager must first make
sure that the project has met its objectives and accomplished what it set out to achieve. The
Closing process group is also concerned with the following objectives:
aOE   Obtaining formal acceptance of the project's completion
aOE   Closing out procurement contracts
aOE   Releasing the project resources
aOE   Measuring customer satisfaction
aOE   Archiving the project information for later use
   Figure 6.6 reflects the objectives of the Closing process group through several key ques-
tions that the project manager should ask before considering the project fully closed.

   Next, we'll go through the two closing processes and review the interactions that occur
within them.


Project Integration Management Knowledge
Area Review
A project closeout cannot occur without first finalizing all project or phase activities. The
Close Project or Phase process from within the Project Integration Management Knowledge
Area is responsible for making this happen. Figure 6.7 shows what occurs within this pro-
cess. The accepted deliverables are used to verify that the project or the project phase has
accomplished what it needed to.

                                             service, or result


    The Close Project or Phase process is also responsible for administrative closure of the
project or project phase. The result is the transition to the customer of the final product,
service, or result that the project created.
    Before a project can be fully closed, all of the project documents must be archived
within the organizational process assets. As you may recall, this includes all of the proj-
ect files, any closing documents, and historical information. The historical information
is archived within the lessons learned knowledge base, which will be a valuable asset to
future projects.


Project Procurement Management Knowledge
Area Review
All procurement contracts must be completed and closed out before the project itself can
close. This means that any loose ends or work on the vendor's end must be finalized as part
of closing activities. This occurs through the Close Procurements process, which is the only
                                                   Bringing the Processes Togethera*...     345




closingrelated process within the Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area. As
Figure 6.8 illustrates, information from the project management plan and the procurement
documents are used in closing out the procurement contracts.

                                             contracts.



   Keep in mind that procurement contracts may terminate without completion of the
work. Remember that this is a special circumstance and all parties must mutually agree
upon early termination.
   You may have already noticed that the Close Project or Phase and the Close
Procurements processes work together. Both processes confirm that the work has been
completed and verified. You'll also notice that the Close Project or Phase process cannot
end until the Close Procurements process has been completed.

Chapter 1: Project Foundation
1.    B. Ongoing operations are continuous without a specific end date, whereas projects have
      definite start and end dates.

2.    C. Although all the options appear attractive, a project is not considered successful until it
      has met the expectations of the project stakeholders.

3.    C. Programs include groups of related projects managed in a coordinated fashion. Each
      project under a program is managed by its own project manager, who reports to a project
      manager responsible either for that area of the program or for the entire program.

4.    A. The functional organization type is considered to be the traditional approach to organiz-
      ing businesses. Functional organizations are centered on specialties, grouped by function,
      and displayed as a hierarchy.

5.    B. Assuring efficient use of resources toward a specific business goal is the role of a portfo-
      lio manager. Although a PMO may help manage resources across projects, it doesn't man-
      age resources toward a specific goal, but rather manages the objectives of a collective set of
      projects.

6.    B. Within a projectized organization, project managers have high to ultimate authority, giv-
      ing them the capability of assigning resources.

7.    A. Integration refers to a Knowledge Area within the PMBOK(R) Guide, which will be
      addressed in a future chapter. Because the word closely resembles Initiating, the first pro-
      cess group within the project life cycle, they can easily be confused.

8.    B. Costs are highest during the Executing process group, since this is where the most time
      and resources are used within a project.

9.    D. This describes the PlanDoCheckAct cycle, which was originally defined by Walter
      Shewhart and later modified by Edward Deming.

10. B. While having a strong knowledge of finance and accounting principles would be benefi-
    cial to a project manager, only a basic level of knowledge is required.

11. C. Within a functional organization, the functional manager has a higher level of authority
    over the project manager, who has minimal to none.

12. D. Do not confuse the project life cycle that all projects go through with the process groups
    that are identified in the PMBOK(R) Guide. The project life cycle consists of (1) starting the
    project, or initiating, (2) planning the work, (3) performing the project work, and (4) clos-
    ing out the project.

13. A. Business skills listed in this chapter include communication, budgeting, organization,
    problem solving, negotiation and influencing, leading, and team building skills. Data man-
    agement skills are a more technical skill set with more of a functional implication than a
    project management focus.

14. D. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Initiating process group contains the following
    actions:
     (1) Developing the project charter, which formally authorizes the project, and (2) identifying
     the project stakeholders.

15. C. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the closing process group contains the following
    actions: (1) Finalizing the project work to formally complete the project or project phase,
    and (2) completing and then closing out all vendor contracts.



Chapter 2: Initiating the Project
1.   B. Identify Stakeholders, Plan Stakeholder Management, and Control Stakeholder Engage-
     ment are all processes of the Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area. The other
     process of this Knowledge Area includes Manage Stakeholder Engagement. Remember that
     in several instances, the name of a process can provide key clues in regard to the process
     group and Knowledge Area it belongs to.

2.   D. A feasibility study takes place prior to making a final decision about starting a project
     and determines the viability of the project or product, the probability of it succeeding, and
     whether the technology proposed is feasible.

3.   C. When projects are evaluated using the scoring model, the project with the highest overall
     weighted score is the best choice. Therefore, Project C, which has the highest score at 17, is
     the correct answer.

4.   B. Multiobjective programming is a mathematical model technique. Mathematical models
     are also known as constrained optimization methods, making B the correct choice. As a side
     note, A and C refer to the same method, and D is a type of benefit measurement method.

5.   A. To calculate the present value you would use the following formula:
                                         PV = FV / (1 + i)n
                                         PV = $5,525 / (1 + 0.10)4
     After working out the problem, the result is a planned value of $3,773.65.

6.   B. Notice that the question asks for the best choice. Both the product scope description and
     project charter provide information about the characteristics of the product, service, or
     result of the project, but the product scope description directly defines these characteristics,
     making B the best choice.

7.   D. The Develop Project Charter process contains five inputs: the project statement of work,
     business case, agreements, organizational process assets, and enterprise environmental fac-
     tors. D is an output of this process.

8.   D. The project charter isn't complete until signoff has been received from the project sponsor,
     senior management, and key stakeholders. The signatures signify the formal authorization of
     the project. A project charter cannot be published until after signoff has been obtained.
352a*...     Appendixa*  a* Answers to Review Questions



9.    C. There are four inputs to the Identify Stakeholders process: procurement documents,
      project charter, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets. C is an
      input to the Develop Project Charter process, and this information is reflected within the
      project charter input (B).

10. A. The stakeholder register is a document that captures all of the details about the identified
    stakeholders. It typically includes identification information, assessment information, and
    stakeholder classification. A provides the best description from the list of options provided.

11. A. Polly has just performed the Develop Project Charter process. After the creation of the
    charter, the project manager is likely to begin the process of identifying stakeholders by
    performing the Identify Stakeholders process. These two processes both belong to the Initi-
    ating process group.

12. B. Stakeholder analysis is a technique used within the Identify Stakeholders process. Stake-
    holder analysis is typically used to identify the influences stakeholders have in regard to the
    project and understand their expectations, needs, and desires.

13. D. The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area includes six processes: Plan Scope
    Management, Collect Requirements, Define Scope, Create WBS, Validate Scope, and Con-
    trol Scope.

14. C. While a project manager was assigned, the project has not been formally approved. In
    order to formalize the project and obtain authorization to utilize resources of the organiza-
    tion, a project charter must first be developed and approved.

15. D. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project scope identifies the work that needs to be
    accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and
    functionality.

16. A. Project scope is measured against the project management plan, which encompasses the
    various plans and baselines of the project, including the scope baseline.

17. B. Stakeholder analysis, a tool and technique of the Identify Stakeholders process, consists
    of three general steps: (1) identify stakeholders and capture general information about
    them, (2) identify the potential impact or support each may have on the project and classify
    them, and (3) assess the reaction or responses of the stakeholder to various situations.

18. D. Lifecycle costing is an economic evaluation technique that determines the total cost of
    not only the project (temporary costs) but also owning, maintaining, and operating some-
    thing from an operational standpoint after the project is completed and turned over.

19. A. The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area is responsible for identifying,
    defining, combining, unifying, and coordinating the various processes and project manage-
    ment activities across the project management process groups.

20. C. Develop Project Charter is the first process of the Project Integration Management
    Knowledge Area and is responsible for the creation of the project charter. The project char-
    ter formally initiates the project in the organization and gives authorization for resources to
    be committed to a project.

Chapter 3: Planning the Project
1.   C. The project scope statement is an output of the Define Scope process and is not included
     as part of the project management plan. The following plans and components are included:
     scope management plan, requirements management plan, schedule management plan, cost
     management plan, quality management plan, communications management plan, risk man-
     agement plan, procurement management plan, human resource management plan, schedule
     baseline, cost baseline, and the scope baseline.

2.   A. Option A refers to those participating in a focus group, whereas B refers to interviews, C
     refers to the Delphi technique, and D refers to facilitated workshops.

3.   B. Sam is currently using product analysis, which is a method for converting the product
     description and project objectives into deliverables and requirements. To do this, Sam
     may have used any of the following: value analysis, functional analysis, requirements
     analysis, systemsengineering techniques, systems analysis, product breakdown, and value
     engineering techniques.

4.   D. The WBS contains deliverables that are broken down to the work package level. The
     work packages are not broken down into the activity level until the Define Activities pro-
     cess, which cannot occur until after the WBS has been created.

5.   A. Finishtostart is the type of logical relationship most frequently used within precedence
     diagramming methods and therefore the most likely choice. Option B, starttofinish, is
     used the least.

6.   A. The formula for calculating communications channels is n multiplied by n - 1, all
     divided by 2, where n represents the total number of stakeholders within the project. When
     you plug in the number of stakeholders in Rodrigo's project, the following formula results:

                                             32(32 - 1) / 2

7.   C. Option A refers to Plan Risk Management, B refers to Identify Risks, and D refers to
     Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis.

8.   C. Costreimbursable contracts carry the highest risk for the buyer because the total cost
     of the goods or services purchased is uncertain and the seller charges all costs to the buyer
     with no preset cap. As a side note, options A and B refer to the same type of contract.

9.   B. Philip B. Crosby believed that preventing defects from occurring resulted in lower costs
     and conformance to requirements and that cost of quality transformed to cost of confor-
     mance as opposed to the cost of reworking.

10. D. Option D is another name for quality metrics, which is an output of the Plan Quality
    Management process. Although C is not directly listed as a tool and technique of this pro-
    cess, it is listed by the PMBOK(R) Guide as an additional quality planning tool.

11. C. Option C is another name for the requirements documentation, which is an output of
    the Collect Requirements process.
354a*...    Appendixa*  a* Answers to Review Questions



12. B. Option B is the correct answer for the purpose of collecting requirements. The output of
    the Collect Requirements process is used as an input for the other options, but the overall
    goal is to ensure that stakeholder expectations have been met.

13. A. Option A is the best definition of a project constraint. Option B is the definition of a
    project assumption. Although there may be situations where Option C is true, constraining
    the ability of the project team in terms of time, money, and scope will almost always impact
    the project outcomes. Option D is not a good answer because constraints can constantly
    change over the course of a project and need to be reevaluated.

14. D. Option D is the correct answer for a critical path, which has zero float, meaning that it
    influences the longest full path on a project.

15. B. Option B is the correct description for the cost baseline, and it is displayed as an Scurve.

16. C. Option C is the best answer, and the cost of quality includes all the work necessary to
    meet the product requirements for quality. The three costs associated with cost of quality
    are prevention, appraisal, and failure costs (also known as cost of poor quality).

17. C. Option C is not correct for meeting quality requirements as costs are typically lower due
    to a reduction in rework.

18. A. Option A is the purpose of the communications management plan. Project roles and
    responsibilities, reporting relationships for the project, and the staffing plan are all deter-
    mined by the Plan Human Resources Management process.

19. B. Option B is a tool and technique used in the Plan Procurement Management process.
    The procurement statement of work, procurement documents, and source selection criteria
    are some of the outputs of this process. During the exam, be sure not mix up the inputs,
    tools and techniques, and outputs in the question.

20. C. Option C is a process in the Plan Risk Management Knowledge Area, but it is the only
    choice that is a part of the Monitoring and Controlling process group. Identify Risks is a
    part of the Planning process group and includes identifying all risks that might impact the
    project, documenting them, and identifying their characteristics.



Chapter 4: Executing the Project
1.    B. Jon's upcoming role within the project has been preassigned. Be sure to keep your eyes
      open for clues in the question's scenario. For instance, Jon has been looking forward to this
      assignment for months, yet the project has not officially begun. This means that Jon would
      have been included within the project charter as a specific team member assigned to the role
      of software architect. Although Option C, project team member, is also correct, the ques-
      tion asks for the best answer.

2.    C. Options A, B, and D are all benefits of virtual teams. A war room requires team mem-
      bers to be colocated, which means that they are based out of the same physical location.
      Since virtual teams are spread out in various locations, C is the correct choice.
                                                   Chapter 4: Executing the Projecta*...          355



3.   B. Storming, the second of Bruce Tuckman and Mary Ann Jensen's five stages of team
     development, is when employees tend to be more confrontational with one another as they
     are vying for position and control.

4.   D. The chaotic meeting scenario is a result of a lack of ground rules. Ground rules deter-
     mine acceptable team behavior and rules that should be applied during meetings. As the
     scenario exhibits, a lack of ground rules can lead to poor productivity and wasted time.

5.   A. The correct choice is social needs, which is the third level from the bottom in Maslow's
     pyramid. This is the level that describes the need to belong, be loved, and be accepted.

6.   C. Collaborating, also called problem solving, is the best strategy for resolving conflict
     because it brings about a winwin result.

7.   C. Communication methods are a tool and technique of the Manage Communications pro-
     cess and include all means that make it possible to communicate project information to the
     appropriate individuals.

8.   B. Quality audits bring about quality improvements and greater efficiency to how pro-
     cesses and activities are carried out, making Option B the correct choice. Option A
     describes process analysis. Although quality audits can reveal information on team per-
     formance, the purpose is not to conduct performance reviews. Quality audits ensure that
     applicable laws and standards are being adhered to, but it is not a legal requirement to
     conduct them.

9.   A. Douglas McGregor is responsible for Theory X & Y. Frederick Herzberg defined the
     Hygiene theory, Abraham Maslow created Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, and Victor
     Vroom is responsible for the Expectancy theory.

10. A. The stakeholder management plan is an input to the process as opposed to a tool and
    technique. Avoid selecting an answer too quickly simply because you recognize a connec-
    tion between a term and a process name.

11. C. The project manager in this scenario is carrying out the Develop Project Team process.
    This process is concerned with creating a positive environment for team members; develop-
    ing the team into an effective, functioning, coordinated group; and increasing the team's
    competency levels.

12. B. The Executing process group is where the work reflected in the plan is carried out, and
    as a result, where the majority of the project budget is spent.

13. A. Obtaining and managing resources is a key step to kicking off the execution of the plan,
    which occurs through processes that fall in the Project Human Resource Management
    Knowledge Area and Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area.

14. C. The question describes bidder conferences, which are meetings held with prospective
    vendors prior to the completion of their response to a seller's proposal. This technique is
    used as part of the Conduct Procurements process.

15. D. Option D provides the definition of a deliverable as noted in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
356a*...     Appendixa*  a* Answers to Review Questions



16. B. The question describes the work performance data output of the Direct and Man-
    age Project Work process. Work performance data involves gathering, documenting, and
    recording the status of project work.

17. A. The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process creates the issue log. Other outputs of
    this process include change requests, project management plan updates, project documents
    updates, and organizational process assets updates.

18. B. Work performance information generates data that has been analyzed and is an output
    generated from the processes that fall in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.
    Work performance data, on the other hand, represents raw data produced out of the Direct
    and Manage Project Work process.

19. C. Change requests are an output of the Perform Quality Assurance process, not an input.

20. D. Polly has just carried out the Perform Quality Assurance process. Corrective actions are
    documented through change requests output of the process.



Chapter 5: Monitoring and Controlling
the Project
1.    D. Deliverables are an output of the Direct and Manage Project Work process, not of the
      Monitor and Control Project Work process. Preventive actions and defect repairs (Options
      B and C) are part of change requests.

2.    C. Options A and B are inputs of the Control Procurements process, and Option D is an
      output. This leaves C, performance reporting. Performance reporting provides information
      about the vendor's progress in meeting contract objectives. This question simply tested your
      ability to distinguish between the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process.

3.    A. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you must integrate and coordinate the Direct and
      Manage Project Work, Control Quality, Perform Integrated Change Control, and Con-
      trol Risks processes during the Control Procurements process. Only Close Procurements,
      Option A, is not included in this list of processes.

4.    C. Option A refers to change control meetings, Option B refers to the configuration man-
      agement system, and Option D refers to the change control system. Also notice that C, the
      correct choice, is the only option that specifically mentions contracts.

5.    A. In this scenario, the stakeholder is looking for the latest cost performance index, which
      measures the value of the work completed against actual cost. The correct formula simply
      takes the earned value and divides it by the actual cost.

6.    C. Change requests should always be documented, even if verbal approval has been pro-
      vided by a high authority figure of the project (such as the project sponsor in this scenario).
      Obtaining the approval of the project sponsor may speed up the approval process, but it
      may not replace it.

7.   D. You may have been tempted to choose Option C. However, budget analysis is not a
     tool and technique of the Control Risks process, which is the process used in this sce-
     nario. The correct choice is reserve analysis. Reserve analysis compares the amount
     of unused contingency reserve to the remaining amount of risk. This information is
     then used to determine whether a sufficient amount of reserve remains to deal with the
     remaining risks.

8.   A. To calculate variance at completion, simply subtract the estimate at completion (EAC)
     from the budget at completion (BAC). Plug in the numbers provided in the question and
     work out the problem as follows:

                                         VAC = 1,500 - 1,350

9.   B. The project manager is currently in the Control Schedule process. This can be a tricky
     question because PV and SPI were mentioned, steering you toward the Control Costs pro-
     cess. In this scenario, the project manager is specifically using the variance analysis tech-
     nique of the Control Schedule process.

10. C. For reference, know the level of quality for 1 sigma (68.27 percent level of accuracy),
    2 sigma (95.46 percent level of accuracy), 3 sigma (99.73 percent level of accuracy), and 6
    sigma (99.99 percent level of accuracy).

11. D. When the work is proceeding according to the plan, calculate ETC using the following
    formula: ETC - AC. When plugging in the values provided by the question, the calculation
    is as follows: $250,000 - $50,000 = $200,000.

12. B. TCPI is the projected performance level the remaining work of the project must achieve
    to meet the BAC or EAC. Option A describes SPI, Option C describes EAC, and Option D
    describes ETC.

13. D. The Control Communications process is responsible for monitoring and controlling
    communications throughout the duration of the project. It is through this process that the
    project manager ensures that the communication requirements of stakeholders are met,
    along with their needs and expectations.

14. B. Deliverables are verified through the Control Quality process. Verified deliverables are
    then taken through the Validate Scope process, which seeks to obtain formal acceptance of
    completed deliverables.

15. D. Polly has been asked by the sponsor to calculate estimate at completion (EAC). When the
    project is expected to continue at a steady rate of performance, use the following formula to
    calculate EAC: BAC / CPI. In order to calculate EAC, you must first calculate CPI with the
    values provided. To calculate CPI, divide earned value (EV) by actual cost (AC): $300,000 /
    $350,000 = 0.857. Now, plug the values into the EAC formula: $500,000 / 0.857 = $583,431
    (rounded to the nearest dollar).

16. C. Using the EV and PV values provided, calculate the schedule performance index (SPI).
    The formula for SPI is as follows:

                                             SPI = EV / PV
358a*...     Appendixa*  a* Answers to Review Questions



      Using the formula provided, plug in the values to get the following: 20,000 / 35,000 = 0.57.
      When the SPI is >1, it means that the project is ahead of schedule; when it is <1, it means
      that the project is behind schedule. Based on the SPI calculated, the project is very behind
      schedule. In order to determine whether the project is over or under budget, we would need
      the actual cost (AC) value, which was not provided.

17. B. After changes have been implemented, they are validated through the Control Quality
    process. This process inspects the changes made to ensure that they were implemented cor-
    rectly and then accepts or rejects the changes made.

18. A. Based on the values provided, calculate CPI and SPI using the following formulas:
                                             CPI = EV / AC
                                              SPI = EV / PV
      Now, plug in the values to get the following:

                                     CPI: 160,000 / 110,000 = 1.45
                                     SPI: 160,000 / 175,000 = 0.91

      Based on the CPI and SPI values calculated, the project is under budget (getting 91 cents of
      value for every dollar spent) and behind schedule (only 91% on schedule).

19. C. Work performance data is an input of the Control Stakeholder Engagement process,
    not an output. The following are outputs of the process: work performance information,
    change requests, project management plan updates, project documents updates, and organi-
    zational process assets updates.

20. B. Based on the values provided, you can calculate CPI to determine whether there are
    funds available to crash the schedule. To calculate CPI, use the following formula: EV /
    AC. Plug in the values to get the following CPI: $60,000 / $85,000 = 0.71. Based on the
    CPI, the project is also currently over budget. Since crashing is typically a costly option, the
    project manager is likely to fasttrack activities on the critical path where possible.



Chapter 6: Closing the Project
1.    A. Procurement documents is an input used in the Close Procurements process, the second
      and only other process within the Closing process group. Options B, C, and D are the only
      three inputs of the Close Project or Phase process.

2.    C. You may have leaned toward selecting Option A at first glance because deliverables
      are verified during the Validate Scope process. However, the project manager is currently
      confirming that "all deliverables" of the project have been successfully accomplished, not
      validating the actual deliverables themselves. To make this determination, the Close Project
      or Phase process uses the project management plan and the list of accepted deliverables.

3.    C. This question refers to the Close Project or Phase process, which has the following three
      tools and techniques: expert judgment, analytical techniques, and meetings. These are used
                                                      Chapter 6: Closing the Projecta*...           359



     when performing administrative closure. Options A and B are tools and techniques of the
     Close Procurements process, and Option D is an input to the Close Project or Phase process.

4.   D. Transferring the final product, service, or result is an activity and output of the Close
     Project or Phase process.

5.   A. In this scenario, the project manager would refer to the administrative closure proce-
     dures. These procedures address several closure items, such as collecting project records,
     analyzing the success of the project, and documenting the roles and responsibilities of the
     project team members and stakeholders. As part of the latter, the administrative closure
     procedures document the actions to verify that the project deliverables have been accepted
     and that the exit criteria have been met.

6.   A. Procurement documents is an input to the Close Procurements process.

7.   D. Procurement audits are structured reviews spanning all of the procurement processes.
     These audits are concerned with identifying lessons learned and identifying flawed pro-
     cesses or procedures. As a side note, Option A refers to procurement negotiations, Option
     B refers to the records management system, and Option C does not refer to a specific audit
     process.

8.   B. Disputes or outstanding claims are resolved by using alternative dispute resolution tech-
     niques, which are considered to be the most favorable ways of resolving disputes. Option A,
     taking the dispute to court, is the least favorable resolution technique.

9.   D. The project manager has the greatest amount of influence during the Closing processes,
     whereas stakeholders have the least amount of influence during this stage of the project.

10. B. This is a tricky question because all the options are technically correct. However, the
    question asks for the best answer. This would be Option B, the staff release plan. The staff
    release plan is part of the staffing management plan, which is part of the human resource
    management plan, which is part of the project management plan.

11. A. Typically, a phase is marked by the completion of a major deliverable. Signoff of deliver-
    ables occurs through the Validate Scope process, after a quality review has been performed.
    The next step would be to formally close out the phase through the Close Project or Phase
    process.

12. B. Polly's project has been terminated due to starvation. Starvation occurs when resources
    are cut off from the project or are no longer provided to the project.

13. C. Although Polly's project has ended prematurely, she must still perform closure activities
    by carrying out the Close Project or Phase process.

14. B. The Close Project or Phase process belongs to the Project Integration Management Knowl-
    edge Area and is the first of only two processes belonging to the Closing process group.

15. D. Ben is ready to perform the Close Procurements process. It is the procurement manage-
    ment plan that guides the project manager and team in how procurement closure activities
    are to be carried out. While the project management plan is technically accurate as well, the
    procurement management plan is a better option, since it is specific.
