                   To life

        Whose every day is a project

    That I run from the time's shoulders.

               To my friends,

            the key stakeholders:

Gurmail Kandola, John Serri, and Kulwinder

Baldev Khullar, Ruth Gordon, and Bhupinder

Stanley Wong and Srilatha are a few to name.

       With friends, I can see clearly

          Through storm and rain.

           Friends without whom

      Every path is just a trail of dust.

     With whom I'm like the first man

       Walking on the planet Earth.
Acknowledgments
  Each time I get a book published, I re-learn a lesson that transforming an idea into a fin-
  ished book takes a project (it produces a unique product--that is, the book--and it has a
  beginning and an end) and a project team. As they say (well, if they don't anymore, they
  should), first thing first. Let me begin by thanking Mitzi Koontz for initiating this pro-
  ject. With two thumbs up, thanks to Cathleen Snyder for managing this project from the
  planning stage through the executing stage, the monitoring/controlling stage, and all the
  way to the closing stage.
  It's my pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of other members of the team as well: Bill
  Hartman for layout, Heather Urschel for proofreading, and Katherine Stimson for index-
  ing. My special thanks to Paul Gneco and Anil Punjabi, the technical editors of this book,
  for carefully reviewing all the chapters and offering valuable feedback.
  In some ways, writing this book is an expression of the project manager and educator inside
  me. I thank some great minds from whom I directly or indirectly learned about manage-
  ment during my journey in the computer industry from Novell to Dream Logic: Chuck
  Castleton at Novell, Delon Dotson at Netscape and MP3.com, Kate Peterson at Webor-
  der, and Dr. John Serri at Dream Logic. I also thank my colleagues and seniors in the
  field of education for helping me in so many ways to become a better educator. Here are
  a few to mention: Dr. Gerald Pauler (Brooks College), Professor David Hayes (San Jose
  State University), Professor Michael Burke (San Jose State University), and Dr. John
  Serri (University of Phoenix).
  Last, but not least, my appreciation (along with my heart) goes to my wife, Renee, and my
  son, Adam, for not only peacefully coexisting with my projects, but also for supporting
  them.

Introduction

   "`Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'"
                                                      --Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll




       he primary purpose of this book is to help you pass the Project Management Profes-
   T   sional (PMP) exam and the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)
   exam, both administered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). Because the book
   has a laser-sharp focus on the exam objectives, expert project managers who want to pass
   any of these exams can use this book to ensure that they do not miss any objective. Yet this
   is not an exam-cram book. The chapters and the sections within each chapter are presented
   in a logical learning sequence: A topic and a chapter only depend upon the previously cov-
   ered topics and chapters, and there is no hopping from topic to topic. The concepts and
   topics, both simple and complex, are clearly explained when they appear for the first time.
   No prior knowledge of project management is assumed. This facilitates stepwise learning,
   prevents confusion, and makes this book useful also for beginners who want to get up to
   speed quickly to pass the CAPM exam, even if they are new to the discipline of project
   management.


Who This Book Is For
   With a focus on the PMP and CAPM exam topics, this book is designed to serve the fol-
   lowing audiences:
        Project management practitioners who want to prepare for the PMP exam.
        Entry-level project managers and project team members who want to prepare
        for the CAPM exam.
        Beginners who want to join the field of project management.
        Project managers who want a book to use as a quick and easy reference to the
        discipline of project management.
        Instructors and trainers who want a textbook for a course on project manage-
        ment. Instructional resource materials related to this book are available from the
        publisher.
xiv   Introduction


      How the Book Is Organized
           This book tells the story of project management in a cohesive, concise, yet comprehensive
           fashion. This book is written to the most current version of the PMP and CAPM exams
           based on the third edition of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
           (PMBOK) by PMI. The discipline of project management, according to PMBOK, con-
           tains nine knowledge areas, such as cost management and quality management, and five
           process groups: initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing. The PMBOK and
           almost all project management exam books are organized along the knowledge areas. How-
           ever, the exam objectives published by PMI are organized in order of the process groups.
           This poses a problem for the reader preparing for the exam based on exam objectives. For
           example, one of these books refers to 11 chapters for one exam objective in its exam readi-
           ness checklist. This book solves this problem by presenting the material in order of process
           groups: initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing. This order of presentation
           is also consistent with the lifecycle of a project, and therefore facilitates natural learning
           by connecting to real-world experience.


      How Each Chapter Is Organized
           With the exception of Chapter 1, on project management framework, each chapter begins
           with a list of exam objectives on which the chapter is focused. These objectives are officially
           called tasks by PMI, and these tasks are organized into domains, which are essentially the
           process groups, except the last domain. We have exactly followed the order of the domains
           published by PMI, but have shuffled around a few objectives to keep the topics and the sub-
           ject matter in line with sequential learning and to avoid hopping from topic to topic.
           The first section in each chapter is an introduction in which we establish three concepts
           or topics that will be explored in the chapter. Each chapter has the following features:
                Exam Objectives. Each exam objective covered in the chapter is fully explained
                     at the beginning of the chapter.
                     Summary. The Summary section of each chapter provides the big, unified pic-
                     ture while reviewing the important concepts in the chapter.
                     Exam's Eye View. The Exam's Eye View section highlights the important
                     points in the chapter from the perspective of the exam: the things that you must
                     comprehend, the things that you should watch out for because they might not
                     seem to fit in with the ordinary order of things, and the facts that you should
                     memorize for the exam.
                     Key Terms. This section lists the important terms and concepts introduced in
                     the chapter along with their definitions.
                     Review Questions. Each chapter ends with a Review Questions section that
                     has a two-pronged purpose: to help you test your knowledge about the material
                     presented in the chapter, and to help you evaluate your ability to answer the
                     exam questions based on the exam objectives covered in the chapter. The
                     answers to the review questions are presented in Appendix A.

xvi   Introduction


           As mentioned previously, the PMP and CAPM exam objectives are organized along the
           process groups (stages of the project lifecycle, as we call them in this book). These process
           groups and the topics of professional and social responsibility are called the domains. The
           relative weight given to these domains in the PMP exam is listed in the following table.

           The relative weight given to these domains in the CAPM exam is approximately the
           same. The main difference between the questions in the two exams is that the PMP exam
           will have situational questions that assume you have been working in the project manage-
           ment field.
           The following points are common to both the exams:
                  Pretest questions are randomly placed throughout the examination. Your score
                  does not depend on these questions.
                  Computer-based exams are preceded by a 15-minute computer tutorial, which is
                  not part of the allotted exam time.
                  The passing score is determined by an approach called the Modified Angoff Tech-
                  nique, which relies on the collective judgment of groups of CAPM certificants
                  from around the globe. The final passing score for the examination is based on
                  this pooled judgment and the calculation of the standard error on the mean.
                  Finally, item analysis and reliability indices are calculated for each question.
           These credential examinations are offered via computer at locations in North America
           and in other countries around the world. For a complete list of computer-based testing

Following are a few tips that you can use during the exam:
     The questions in the PMP exam can be wordy and might include unnecessary
        information to distract you from the relevant facts. So, you need to read the
        questions carefully and patiently and figure out what counts and what does not.
        Get comfortable with the idea that there will be some questions that you will
        not be able to answer correctly. Don't let it bother you, and leave these questions
        for a possible review later if you have time. Move on without getting frustrated.
        There will be tricky questions to weed out candidates who might have project
        management experience, but who do not have an in-depth understanding of the
        discipline of project management from the perspective of PMI, as covered in
        this book.
        There will be questions for which you will need to choose between an innocent
        way of skipping the formal process to save time and following the formal project
        management process. In almost all the cases, the correct answer will be to follow
        the process.
        There will be questions for which you will need to choose between facing the
        problem head-on or taking an easy way out, such as dodging a thorny issue,
        ignoring a challenging problem, or postponing a difficult decision. Almost
        always, the correct answer is to meet the problem head-on.
        To answer some questions correctly, understand that in the world of project
        management as seen from the perspective of PMI, project managers communi-
        cate directly and clearly and do not say things between the lines. For example, if
        you have a problem with a team member, you talk to the team member face to
        face rather than going to the member's manager, which you might need to do
        eventually if you can't solve the problem by directly dealing with the team
        member.
        Understand clearly the roles of the key stakeholders, such as the project manger,
        project sponsor, and customer. Especially understand your responsibilities as
        a project manager. You need to be proactive to make decisions and manage
        the project, influence the factors that contribute to changes rather than waiting
        for the changes, and have up-to-date information about the project.
Best wishes for the exam; go for it!

   Influence of organizational structure on project management
Introduction
  What do the Taj Mahal, the Internet, and this book have in common? Projects! All three of
  them are products of projects. Even given all the required material and the knowledge, how do
  people really build immense and complex structures or systems, such as the Taj Mahal of Agra,
  the Eiffel Tower of Paris, or the World Wide Web of the Information Age? The answer is again
  projects. Through projects, it is possible to build small and big, and simple and complex things
  in an effective and efficient manner. All projects need to be managed. A so-called unmanaged
  project is simply a poorly managed project that is destined to fail. Therefore, the importance
  of project management cannot be overstated.
  Managing a project means managing the lifecycle of the project, starting from the beginning
  (initiating) and going to the end (closing); this is accomplished using processes, which consti-
  tute what are called project management knowledge areas. Although you use your knowledge in
  terms of processes to manage the projects, the management will be greatly influenced by the
  structure of the organization in which the project is being performed.
  The goal of this chapter is to walk you through the framework of project management. To that
  end, we will explore three avenues: the project lifecycle, project management knowledge areas,
  and the influence of the organizational structure on the project management.



Basic Concepts
  Each discipline of knowledge builds upon some basic concepts. The terms that refer to or define
  these concepts make up the language of the discipline. The very basic terms in project man-
  agement are described briefly in the following list:
       Project. A project is a work effort made over a finite period of time with a start and
       a finish to create a unique product, service, or result. Because a project has a start
       and an end, it is also called a temporary effort or endeavor.
       Organization. An organization is a group of individuals organized to work for some
       purpose or mission. Computer companies, energy companies (to whom you pay your
       electric bills), and cable companies are examples of organizations. An organization
       might offer products, such as books and donuts, or services, such as Internet access
       or online banking. A project is usually performed inside an organization.
                                           MANAGING PROJECTS                      Chapter 1           3


       Project stakeholder. A project stakeholder is an individual or an organization that
          can be positively or negatively affected by the project execution. A project can have a
          wide spectrum of stakeholders, from the project sponsor, to an environmental orga-
          nization, to an ordinary citizen.
          Process. A process is a set of related tasks performed to manage a certain aspect of a
          project, such as cost. Each process belongs to a knowledge area.
          Knowledge area. A knowledge area in project management is defined by its knowl-
          edge requirements related to managing a specific aspect of a project, such as cost, by
          using a set of processes. PMI recognizes a total of nine knowledge areas, such as cost
          management and human resource management.
          Performing organization. The performing organization is the organization that is
          performing the project.
          Project management. Project management is the usage of knowledge, skills, and
          tools to manage a project from start to finish with the goal of meeting the project
          requirements. It involves using the appropriate processes.
          Program. A program is a set of related projects managed in a coordinated fashion to
          improve overall efficiency and effectiveness. For example, a program could be deliv-
          ering a product (or service) that consists of sub-products (or service components)
          delivered by the constituent projects. Also, a program might include related work
          that is not included in the scope of the constituent projects.
          Program management. Program management is the centralized, coordinated man-
          agement of a specific program to achieve its strategic goals, objectives, and benefits.
          Program management office (PMO). Program management office (or project man-
          agement office) refers to an entity in an organization who is responsible for provid-
          ing centralized coordinated management for programs--that is, projects in the
          organization.
  This is a minimal set of terms that you need to understand before you can start the exploration
  of the world of project management. More terms will be introduced as you continue exploring
  the discipline of project management in this book.
  Now that you understand these basic terms, you can ask a very basic question: What does it
  mean to manage a project? In other words, what's involved in managing a project?



Managing Projects
  At any organization there are many activities being executed every day. Most of these activi-
  ties are organized into groups of interrelated activities. These groups fall into two categories:
  projects and operations. An operation is an ongoing and repetitive set of tasks, whereas a pro-
  ject has a lifecycle--a beginning and an end.
4     Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


    Understanding a Project
       A project is a work effort made over a finite period of time with a start and a finish to create
       a unique product, service, or result. Because a project has a start and a finish, it is also called a
       temporary effort or endeavor. In other words, a project is a temporary endeavor taken to create
       a unique product, service, or result. So, a project has two defining characteristics: It is tempo-
       rary and it creates a unique product. Let's explore further these two defining concepts: tempo-
       rary and unique.
       Temporary. The temporary nature of projects refers to the fact that each project has a definite
       beginning and a definite end. A project can reach its end in one of two possible ways:
            The project has met its objectives--that is, the planned unique product has been
            created.
            The project has been terminated before its successful completion for whatever reason.
       The temporary nature of projects can also apply to two other aspects:
            The opportunity to market the product that the project will produce is temporary--
            that is, the product needs to be produced in a limited timeframe; otherwise, it will
            be too late.
            A project team is temporary--that is, the project team is disbanded after the project
            ends, and the team members may be individually assigned to other projects.
       However, remember that the temporary nature of a project does not refer to the product it cre-
       ates. The projects can create lasting products, such as the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower, or the
       Internet. The second defining characteristic of a project is that it must create a unique prod-
       uct.
       Unique product. The outcome of a project must be a unique product, service, or result. How
       do a product, service, and result differ from each other?
            Product. This is a tangible, quantifiable artifact that is either the end item or a com-
            ponent of it. The big-screen television set in your living room, the Swiss watch on
            your wrist, and the wine bottle on your table are some examples of products.
            Service. Actually, when we say a project can create a service, we really mean the
            capability to perform a service. For example, a project that creates a Web site for a
            bank to offer online banking has created the capability to offer the online banking
            service.
            Result. This is usually the knowledge-related outcome of a project--for example,
            the results of an analysis performed in a research project.
       Quite often we will refer to product, service, or result as just "product" for brevity.
       Projects are organized to execute a set of activities that cannot be addressed within the limits
       of the organization's ongoing normal operations. To clearly identify whether an undertaking is
       a project, you must understand the difference between a project and an operation.
                                             MANAGING PROJECTS                         Chapter 1           5


Distinguishing Projects from Operations
   An organization executes a multitude of activities as part of the work to achieve objectives.
   Some of these activities are to support projects and others are to support what are called oper-
   ations. An operation is a set of tasks that does not qualify to be a project. In other words, an
   operation is a function that performs ongoing tasks: It does not produce a unique (new) prod-
   uct or it does not have a beginning and an end--or both. For example, to put a data center
   together is a project, but after you put it together, keeping it up and running is an operation.
   It is important to understand that projects and operations share some characteristics, such as
   the following:
           Both require resources, including human resources (people).
           Both are constrained to limited, as opposed to unlimited, resources.
           Both are managed--that is, planned, executed, and controlled.
           Both have objectives.
   The distinctions between projects and operations can be made by sticking to the definition of
   a project--that it is temporary and unique. Operations are generally ongoing and repetitive.
   Although both projects and operations have objectives, a project ends when its objectives are
   met, whereas an operation continues toward attaining a new set of objectives when the current
   set of objectives has been attained.
   Projects can be performed at various levels of an organization; they vary in size, and accord-
   ingly can involve just one person or a team. Table 1.1 presents some examples of projects.


    Table 1.1 Examples of Projects
    Project                                           Outcome (Product, Service, or Result)

    Constructing Eiffel Tower                         Product

    Running presidential election campaign            Results: win or lose; Products: documents

    Developing a Web site to offer online education   Service

    Setting up a computer network in one building     Service

    Moving a computer network from one building       Result: network is moved
    to another

    Study the genes of members of Congress            Results (of the research); Product: research paper


   A project can result in a product (or service) that is sustained by an operation. For example,
   constructing the Eiffel Tower is a project, whereas managing it for the tourists visiting it every
   day is an operation.
6     Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


       Where do projects originally come from? In other words, how do you come up with a project?
       Sure, you have an idea, a concept of some final product, but how exactly you write it down and
       declare it a project? A project is born and brought up through a procedure called progressive
       elaboration.


    Understanding Progressive Elaboration
       As the saying goes: Rome was not built in a day. Rest aside, the product of a project--even the
       project plan--is not built in a day either. Usually there is a concept first, and a broad vision for
       the end product--that is, the outcome of the project. The clearer vision you have of the unique
       product that you want from the project, the more accurate the project plan will be. So, you move
       toward the project plan in incremental steps as the ideas about the final product are refined
       and as you get more and more information about the requirements in a progressive fashion.
       This procedure of defining (or planning) a project is called progressive elaboration.
       Here is an example of progressive elaboration. You wake up one morning with an idea to close
       the digital gap in your community. Now, you have a concept of the final product (result) of
       your project: Close the digital gap in your community. But what do you really mean by that?
       It might include many things--building computers in an economic way and providing them
       at low prices to those who don't have them, raising awareness of the necessity of computer lit-
       eracy, offering classes, and the like. Now you are really working to refine your idea of the final
       product. The second question is, how are you going to do this? Here you are referring to the
       project plan. You can see that the project plan and its accuracy and details depend upon how
       refined the idea of the final product is. The final product or objectives and the plan to achieve
       them will be elaborated further in steps.



                    TIP
             Uncontrolled changes that make it into the project without being properly processed
             are called scope creep. Do not confuse progressive elaboration with scope creep.



       Progressive elaboration, in general, means developing something in incremental steps. The pro-
       ject plan will be broadly defined to start, and will get more accurate, detailed, and explicit in
       an incremental fashion as better understanding about the project deliverables and objectives
       develops.
       Even after you have an approved final project plan and the project starts executing, progressive
       elaboration continues to some extent. For example, you will see later in this chapter that exe-
       cution and planning stages of the project interact with each other. Each stage of a project is
       managed by performing a set of processes.
                                             MANAGING PROJECTS                        Chapter 1           7


Understanding a Process
   Processes are the heart of project management. If you want to think of project management
   like a project management professional, think in terms of processes. Almost everything in the
   world of project management is done through processes.
   What is a process, anyway? Back up a little and look around you; you will see processes every-
   where, not only in project management. For example, when you make coffee in the morning,
   you go through a process. The water, the coffee filter, and the roasted hazelnut coffee made by
   grinding golden-colored beans are the input items to this process. The coffeemaker is the tool,
   and how you made the coffee is the technique. A cup of freshly brewed hazelnut coffee is an
   output item from this process. So, a process is a set of interrelated activities performed to obtain
   a specified set of products, results, or services. A process, as explained in the example and in
   Figure 1.1, consists of three elements: input, tools and techniques, and output.




       FIGURE 1.1 Three elements of a process

   Of course, you can come up with other examples of processes that you have been using in your
   life without realizing it. In project management, you use processes to accomplish things, such
   as developing a project schedule, directing and managing the project execution, and develop-
   ing and managing the project team.
   Each process consists of three elements, described in the following list:
        Input. The input to a process consists of the raw data that is needed to start the
        process. For example, the list of activities that need to be scheduled is one of several
        input items to the process that will be used to develop the schedule of a project.
        Tools and techniques. Tools and techniques are the methods used to operate on the
        input to transform it into output. For example, project management software that
        helps to develop a schedule is a tool used in the schedule development process.
        Output. The output is the outcome or the result of a process. Each process contains
        at least one output item; otherwise, there would be no point in performing a process.
        For example, an output item of the schedule development process is, well, the project
        schedule.

       Now that you understand what a process is, you likely realize that you will be using different
       processes at the different stages of a project, such as planning and execution. Actually, the whole
       lifecycle of a project can be understood in terms of five stages, with each stage corresponding
       to a group of processes.


    Understanding the Project Lifecycle
       From authorization to completion, a project goes through a whole lifecycle that includes
       defining the project objectives, planning the work to achieve those objectives, performing the
       work, monitoring the progress, and closing the project after receiving the product acceptance.
       Figure 1.2 shows the different stages of the project lifecycle; the arrows indicate the flow of
       information.




           FIGURE 1.2 Different stages in the lifecycle of a project. Each of these stages represents a
                          process group.

       The five stages, called process groups, of a project lifecycle are described in the following list.
       Initiating. This stage defines and authorizes the project. The project manager is named and
       the project is officially launched through a signed document called the project charter, which
       contains items such as the purpose of the project, a high-level product description, assumptions
       and constraints, a summary of the milestone schedule, and a business case for the project.
       Another outcome of this stage is a document called the preliminary scope statement, which
       describes the characteristics and boundaries of the project. The processes used to perform this
       stage fall into a group called the initiating process group.
                                          MANAGING PROJECTS                       Chapter 1           9



             NOTE
      In the discipline of project management, like in many other disciplines, the term high-
      level means lacking details or not referring to details. Keep this meaning in mind
      when you read the terms in this book, such as high-level product description, high-
      level plan, and the like.


Planning. In this stage, you, the project manger, along with the project management team,
refine the project objectives and requirements and develop the project management plan, which
is a collection of several plans that constitute a course of actions required to achieve the objec-
tives and meet the requirements of the project. The project scope is finalized with the project
scope statement. The project management plan, the outcome of this stage, contains subsidiary
plans, such as a project scope management plan, a schedule management plan, and a quality
management plan. The processes used to perform this stage fall into a group called the plan-
ning process group.
Executing. In this stage you, the project manager, implement the project management plan,
and the project team performs the work scheduled in the planning stage. You coordinate all
the activities being performed to achieve the project objectives and meet the project require-
ments. Of course, the main output of this project is the project deliverables. Approved changes,
recommendations, and defect repairs are also implemented in this stage. But where do these
changes and recommendations come from? They arise from monitoring and controlling the
project. The stakeholders can also suggest changes, which must go through an approval process
before implementation. The project execution is performed using the processes that fall into a
group called the executing process group.
Monitoring and controlling. You monitor and control the project through its lifecycle, includ-
ing the executing stage. Monitoring and controlling includes defending the project against
scope creep (unapproved changes to the project scope), monitoring the project progress and
performance to identify variance from the plan, and recommending preventive and corrective
actions to bring the project in line with the planned expectations. Requests for changes, such
as change to the project scope, are also included in this stage; they can come from you or from
any other project stakeholder. The changes must go through an approval process, and only the
approved changes are implemented. The processes used in this stage fall into a group called the
monitoring and controlling process group.
Closing. In this stage, you manage the formal acceptance of the project product, close any
contracts involved, and bring the project to an end by disbanding the project team. Closing the
project includes conducting a project review for lessons learned, and possibly turning over the
outcome of the project to another group, such as the maintenance or operations group. Don't
forget the last, but not the least, task of the closing stage: celebration. Terminated projects
(that is, projects cancelled before completion) should also go through the closing stage. The
processes used to perform the closing stage fall into the group called the closing process group.
10   Chapter 1      PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK



                    NOTE
            What we refer to as project stages here are not actually the project phases. A project
            phase is part of the whole project in which certain milestones or project deliverables
            are completed. All these stages can be applied to any phase of a project that is
            divided into multiple phases.


      Table 1.2 presents a summary of the project lifecycle. The initiating stage authorizes a project
      by naming the project manager, the planning stage further defines the project objectives and
      plans the work to meet those objectives, the execution stage executes the work, the monitor-
      ing and controlling stage monitors the progress of the project and controls it to keep it in line
      with the plan, and the closing stage formally closes the project by obtaining the product accep-
      tance. Each of these stages is performed by using a group of processes. Thereby, these stages
      are called process groups.

      The stages of a project lifecycle determine when a process is executed, whereas the processes
      themselves belong to certain knowledge areas of project management.
                                            MANAGING PROJECTS                      Chapter 1          11


Understanding Project Management Knowledge Areas
   Managing projects is applying knowledge, skills, and tools and techniques to project activities
   in order to meet the project objectives. You do this by performing some processes at various
   stages of the project, discussed in the previous section. That means processes are part of the
   knowledge required to manage projects. Each aspect of a project is managed by using the cor-
   responding knowledge area. For example, each project has a scope that needs to be managed,
   and the knowledge required to manage scope is in the knowledge area called project scope man-
   agement. To perform the project work within the project scope, you need human resources,
   which need to be managed; the knowledge used to manage human resources is called human
   resource management. You get the idea. Each process belongs to one of the nine knowledge
   areas discussed in the following list.
   Project scope management. The primary purpose of the project scope management is to ensure
   that all the required work (and only the required work) is performed to complete the project
   successfully. This is accomplished by defining and controlling what is included in the project
   and what is not. To be specific, the project scope management includes the following:
        Scope plan. Develop the project scope management plan, which describes how the
           project scope will be defined and controlled, and how all the work within the scope
           will be verified as complete at the end of the project.
           Scope definition. Develop the detailed project scope statement, which is the basis
           for the project scope.
           Work breakdown structure (WBS). Decompose the project deliverables into
           smaller, more manageable work components. The outcome of this exercise is called
           the work breakdown structure.
           Scope control. Control changes to the project scope--only the approved changes to
           the scope should be implemented.
           Scope verification. Plan how the completed deliverables of the project will be
           accepted.
   Obviously, these components are performed by using the corresponding processes. So, the pro-
   ject scope management, in part, defines the work required to complete the project. It's a finite
   amount of work and will require a finite amount of time, which needs to be managed as well.
   Project time management. The primary purpose of the project time management is to develop
   and control the project schedule. This is accomplished by performing the following components:
        Activity definition. Identify all the work activities that need to be scheduled to pro-
           duce the project deliverables.
        Activity sequencing. Identify the dependencies among the activities that need to be
        scheduled (that is, the schedule activity) so that they can be scheduled in the right
        order.
        Activity resource estimating. For each schedule activity, estimate the types of
        resources needed and the quantity for each type.
12   Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


           Activity duration. Estimate the time needed to complete each schedule activity.
           Schedule development. Analyze the data created in the previous steps to develop
           the schedule.
           Schedule control. Control changes to the project schedule.
      You perform these tasks by using the corresponding processes. It will cost you to get the activ-
      ities in the schedule completed, and the cost needs to be managed too.
      Project cost management. The primary goal of the project cost management is to estimate
      the cost and to complete the project within the approved budget. Accordingly, cost manage-
      ment includes the following components:
           Cost estimate. Develop the cost of the resources needed to complete the project,
              which includes schedule activities and outsourced work.
           Cost budgeting. Aggregate the costs of individual activities to establish a cost
           baseline.
           Cost control. Monitor and control the cost variance in the project execution--that
           is, the difference between the planned cost and actual cost during execution, as well
           as changes to the project budget.
      You will use the appropriate processes to accomplish these tasks. The resources needed to
      complete the project activities include human resources, which need to be managed as well.
      Project human resource management. The primary purpose of the project human resource
      management is to obtain, develop, and manage the project team that will perform the pro-
      ject work. To be specific, the project human resource management includes the following
      components:
           Planning human resources. Identify project roles, responsibilities for each role, and
           reporting relationships among the roles. Also, create the staff management plan that
           describes when and how the resource requirements will be met.
           Acquiring the project team. Obtain the human resources.
           Developing the project team. Improve the competencies of the team members and
           the interaction among members to optimize the team performance.
           Managing the project team. Track the performance of team members, provide them
           with feedback, and resolve issues and conflicts. This should all be done with the goal
           to enhance performance--that is, to complete the project on time and within the
           planned cost and scope.
      These components are performed by using the corresponding processes. There will be situa-
      tions in which your organization does not have the expertise to perform certain schedule activ-
      ities in-house. For this or other reasons, you might want to acquire some items or services
      from an outside vendor. This kind of acquisition is called procurement, which also needs to be
      managed.
                                          MANAGING PROJECTS                        Chapter 1           13


Project procurement management. The primary purpose of the procurement management is
to manage acquiring products (that is products, services, or results) from outside the project
team in order to complete the project. The external vendor who offers the service is called the
seller. The procurement management includes planning acquisitions, planning contracts with
sellers, selecting sellers, administering contracts with sellers, and closing contracts. You use the
corresponding processes to accomplish these tasks.
Be it the procured or the in-house work, there are always some uncertainties that give rise to
project risks, which need to be managed.
Project risk management. A project risk is an event that, if it occurs, has a positive or nega-
tive effect on meeting the project objectives. The primary purpose of project risk management
is to identify the risks and respond to them should they occur. To be specific, the project risk
management includes the following:
     Plan the risk management--that is, determine how to plan and execute the risk
        management tasks.
        Identify the risks.
        Perform risk analysis.
        Develop a risk response plan--that is, what action to take should a risk occur.
        Monitor and control risks--that is, track the identified risks, identify new risks, and
        implement the risk response plan.
These tasks related to risk management are performed by using the corresponding processes.
The goal of the risk management is to help meet the project objectives. The degree to which
the project objectives and requirements are met is called quality, which needs to be managed.
Project quality management. Project quality is defined as the degree to which a project satis-
fies its objectives and requirements. For example, a high-quality project is a project that is
completed on time and with all the work in the project scope completed within the planned
budget. The project quality management includes the following:
     Perform quality planning--that is, determine which quality standards are relevant to
        the project at hand and how to apply them.
     Perform quality assurance--that is, ensure the planned quality standards are applied.
     Perform quality control--that is, monitor specific project results to ensure they com-
        ply with the planned quality standards, and recommend actions to eliminate the
        causes of unsatisfactory progress.
These tasks of project quality management are performed by using the corresponding processes.
In order to unify different pieces into a whole project, the different project management activ-
ities need to be integrated.
14   Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


      Project integration management. The project is planned and executed in pieces, and all those
      pieces are related to each other and need to come together. That is where integration manage-
      ment comes in. For example, integrating different subsidiary plans into the project manage-
      ment plan needs to be managed. The project integration management includes developing the
      project management plan, directing and managing project execution, monitoring and control-
      ling the project work, and closing the project.
      So, while managing all the aspects of the project, you, the project manager, will need to coor-
      dinate different activities and groups, and for that you need to communicate.
      Project communication management. It is absolutely imperative for the success of the pro-
      ject that the project information is generated and distributed in a timely fashion. Some would
      say communication is the most important aspect of a project and the most important skill for
      a project manager to have. But without a doubt, it is certainly a critically important compo-
      nent of project management. The communication management includes the following:
           Plan communication--that is, determine the information and communication needs
           of the project at hand.
           Distribute needed information to the project stakeholders in a timely fashion.
           Report the project performance, including the project status.
           Communicate to resolve issues among the stakeholders.
      As you have seen, managing a project largely means performing a set of processes at various
      stages of the project, such as initiating and planning. Accordingly, processes are grouped cor-
      responding to these stages, and the groups are called process groups. Processes are part of the
      knowledge required to manage projects. Each of these processes belongs to one of the nine
      knowledge areas identified in the PMBOK. So a process has a dual membership--one in a
      process group, indicating at what stage of the project the process is performed, and the other
      in a knowledge area, indicating what aspect of the project is managed by using the process.
      Table 1.3 shows this membership for all the processes identified in the PMBOK.


                  NOTE
            Not all the processes are used in all the projects. The project management team
            decides which processes need to be used in a given project.


      Figure 1.3 shows the big picture of project management in terms of the project, processes, pro-
      ject lifecycle, and project aspects managed by different knowledge areas.
      Each project is performed by individuals, and it can affect individuals or organizations even if
      they are not directly (officially) involved in the project. Now we are talking about the project
      stakeholders.

                   ferent stages of the project lifecycle by using the processes



     Introducing Project Stakeholders
            Right from the day you assume responsibility for managing a project, you start meeting a very
            special class of people called project stakeholders. It is very important for the success of the pro-
            ject that you identify these individuals and communicate with them effectively throughout the
            project.


     Identifying Project Stakeholders
            Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively
            or negatively) by the project execution and completion. In other words, a project stakeholder
            has something to gain from the project or lose to the project. Accordingly, the stakeholders fall
            into two categories--positive stakeholders who will normally benefit from the success of the
            project and negative stakeholders who see some kind of disadvantage coming from the project.
            The implications obviously are that the positive stakeholders would like to see the project suc-
            ceed and the negative stakeholders' interests would be better served if the project was delayed
            or cancelled altogether. For example, your city mayor might be a positive stakeholder in a pro-
            ject to open a Wal-Mart store in your neighborhood because it brings business to the city,
            whereas some local business leaders might look at it as a threat to the local businesses and
            thereby may act as negative stakeholders.
            Negative stakeholders are often overlooked by the project manager and the project team,
            which increases the project risk. Ignoring positive or negative project stakeholders will have a
            damaging impact on the project. Therefore, it's important that you, the project manager, start
            identifying the project stakeholders early on in the project. The different project stakeholders
            can have different and conflicting expectations, which you need to analyze and manage.
                  INTRODUCING PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS                                   Chapter 1           17


   Identifying all the project stakeholders might be a difficult task, but the following are the obvi-
   ous stakeholders, starting with you:
        Project manager. Include yourself, the project manager, in the list of the stakehold-
           ers to start with.
           Project management office (PMO). If your organization has a PMO and it is
           directly or indirectly responsible for the outcome of a project, then the PMO is a
           stakeholder in that project.
           Project management team. These are the members of the project team involved in
           the project management tasks.
           Project team members. The members of the project team who are actually perform-
           ing the project work are also project stakeholders.
           Performing organization. The organization whose employees are doing the project
           work is a stakeholder organization.
           Customer/user. This includes the individuals or the organizations for whom the
           project is being performed and the users who will use the product that will result
           from successful completion of the project.
           Project sponsor. This is the individual or group that provides financial resources for
           the project.
           Influencers. These are the individuals or groups who are not direct customers or
           users of the product or service that will come from the project, but who can influ-
           ence the course of the project due to their positions in the customer organization or
           performing organization. The influence can be positive or negative--that is, for or
           against the project.
   In addition to these key stakeholders, who are easy to identify, there can be a number of other
   stakeholders, who might be more difficult to identify, inside and outside of your organization.
   Depending upon the project, these might include investors, sellers, contractors, family mem-
   bers of the project team members, government agencies, media outlets, lobbying organiza-
   tions, individual citizens, and society at large. Have I left anyone out?
   So, the stakeholders not only are affected positively and negatively by the project, but the pro-
   ject can also be impacted positively or negatively by them. It is critical for the success of the
   project that you identify positive and negative stakeholders early on in the project, understand
   and analyze their varying and conflicting expectations, and manage those expectations through-
   out the project


Identifying the Stakeholder Within
   You, the project manager, are a very special project stakeholder yourself. The job (role) of a
   project manager is extremely challenging and thereby exciting. With the help of your team, it
   is your responsibility to bring all the pieces together and make the project happen. You do it
   by using a multitude of skills, described here.
18   Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


      Communication. The importance of communication in project management cannot be
      overemphasized. Even a well-scheduled and well-funded project can fail in the hands of a hard-
      working team of experts due to the lack of proper communication. As a project manager, you
      might be dealing with a wide functional variety of individuals, ranging from executives, to
      marketing personnel, to technologists. You should be able to wear different communication hats
      depending upon whom you are communicating with. For example, you will not be using tech-
      nical jargon to talk to executives or marketing folks, and you will not speak marketing lingo to
      the software developers. You will be speaking to different stakeholders in their language, while
      filling the language gap between different functional groups and eliminating misunderstand-
      ings due to miscommunication. The key point is that you put on the appropriate communica-
      tion hat depending on which individual you are communicating with. Be able to switch
      communication hats quickly and avoid technical jargon and acronyms that are not understood
      by the person or group with whom you are communicating. The goal is clarity of the language
      to convey the message accurately.
      You will be communicating throughout the project. So, for a given project, you must develop
      a communication strategy that addresses the following issues:
           What needs to be communicated?
           With whom do you want to communicate? You might need to communicate differ-
           ent items to different individuals or groups.
           How do you want to communicate--that is, what is the medium of communication?
           Again, this might differ depending on whom you are communicating with.
           What is the outcome of your communication? You need to monitor your communi-
           cation and its results to see what works and what does not, so you can improve com-
           munication.
      Communication is an ingredient for many other skills, such as negotiation and problem-solving.
      Negotiation. A negotiation is give-and-take, with the goal of generating a win-win outcome
      for both parties. You might need to negotiate at any stage of the project lifecycle. Here are some
      examples of negotiations:
           Negotiating with the stakeholders regarding the expectations during the project plan-
              ning. For example, the suggested deadline for the project schedule might not be prac-
              tical, or you might need a certain type or quantity of resources to make it happen.
              Negotiating with the functional managers for obtaining human resources, such as
              software developers.
              Negotiating with the team members for specific job assignments and possibly during
              conflict resolution among the team members.
              Negotiating the changes to the project schedule, budget, or both because a stake-
              holder proposed changes to the project objectives.
              Negotiating with the external vendors in procurement. However, in contract negoti-
              ations, representatives from the legal department might be involved.
         ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCES ON PROJECTS                                    Chapter 1           19


  Sometimes you will be negotiating to solve a problem.
  Problem-solving. Project-related problems might occur among the stakeholders (including
  team members) or with the projects. Either way, they are there to damage the project. Your
  task is twofold--identify the problem early enough and solve it. Here is the general technique
  for accomplishing this:
       Look for early warning signs by paying close attention to the formal progress reports
          and to what the team members say and do regarding the project.
       Once you identify a potential problem, do your homework. Understand and identify
       the problem clearly by collecting more information without passing judgment.
       Once the problem and its causes are clearly identified, work with the appropriate stake-
       holders, such as project team members, to explore multiple (alternative) solutions.
       Evaluate the multiple solutions and choose the one you will implement.
  The key point throughout the problem-solving process is to focus on the problem, not on the
  individuals, with the goal of finding the solution in order to help the project succeed. There
  should be no finger-pointing.
  Sometimes, in choosing and implementing the correct solution, you will need to exercise your
  influencing skill.
  Influencing. Influencing means getting individuals or groups to do what you want them to do
  without necessarily having a formal authority to mandate an outcome from them. This is
  increasingly becoming an essential management skill in today's information economy. To exer-
  cise influence, you must understand the formal and informal structure of your organization.
  Again, you might need to use influencing when you are dealing with any aspect of the pro-
  ject--for example, controlling the changes to the project, negotiating schedule or resource
  assignments, resolving conflicts, and the like.
  Leadership. In the traditional organizational structure, project managers do not have formal
  authority over the project team members who perform the team work. So you have no other
  choice than managing by leadership and not by authority (power). The good news is that man-
  aging by leadership is overall more effective and productive than managing by authority any-
  way. A project team is generally a group of individuals coming together for the lifetime of the
  project from different functional groups with different skills and experience. They need a leader
  to show them the vision, and to excite, inspire, and motivate them toward the goals and the
  objectives of the project. You, the project manager, are that leader.
  Different organizations have different attitudes and policies toward project management. The
  structure of the performing organization has a big influence on your job as a project manager.


Organizational Influences on Projects
  A project is typically performed inside an organization called the performing organization.
  Therefore, projects are influenced by many characteristics of the performing organizations, such
  as culture, style, organizational structure, and maturity of the organization.
20     Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


        From the perspective of a project, there are two kinds of organizations: project-based and non-
        project-based. The project-based organizations fall into two subcategories--those that derive
        their revenue primarily from performing projects for others, and those that do in-house pro-
        jects to deliver products or services for customers. Project-based organizations are well aware
        of the importance of project management and generally have systems to support project man-
        agement. Non-project-based organizations generally have a low appreciation and understand-
        ing of the importance of project management and often lack systems to support project
        management.
        To do your job efficiently and effectively, you must figure out what kind of organization you
        are in. Another huge factor that greatly influences the projects and the management is the orga-
        nizational structure. From the perspective of structure, organizations fall into three categories--
        functional organizations, projectized organizations, matrix organizations.


     Functional Organization
        Functional organization has a traditional organizational structure in which each functional
        department, such as engineering, marketing, and sales, is a separate entity. As shown in Figure
        1.4, the members of each department (staff ) report to the functional manager of that depart-
        ment, and the functional manager in turn reports to an executive, such as the chief executive
        officer (CEO). Depending on the size of the organization, there could be a hierarchy within
        the functional managers--for example, directors of engineering, QA, and IT operations report-
        ing to the vice president (VP) of engineering, who in turn reports to the CEO.
        The scope of a project in a functional organization is usually limited to the boundaries of the
        functional department. Therefore, each department runs its projects largely independent of
        other departments. When a communication needs to occur between two departments, it is
        carried through the hierarchy of functional managers.




            FIGURE 1.4 Structure of a functional organization. Gray boxes represent staff involved in a project.
          ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCES ON PROJECTS                                      Chapter 1           21


   All the managerial power (authority) in a functional organization is vested in the functional
   managers, who control the team members' performance evaluations, salary, bonus, hiring, and
   firing. Project managers are held responsible for the project results even though they have lit-
   tle say over resource assignments and holding team members accountable for their work. As a
   result, project managers in a functional organization are often frustrated. Their work is, at best,
   challenging. You, as a project manager in a functional organization, can benefit greatly from
   your good relationships with functional managers and team members. Networking and lead-
   ership are the key points to your success in a functional organization.
   A project manager in a functional organization has the following attributes:
        The project manager's role and project team are part-time.
        There is little or no authority over anything: resource assignments, team members,
        and the like.
        The project manager reports directly to a functional manager.
        There is little or no administrative staff to help with the project.


                NOTE
         In functional organizations, project management might be conducted under other
         names, such as project coordinator or team leader.


   On the other end of the spectrum is the projectized organization.


Projectized Organization
   A projectized organization's structure is organized around projects. Most of the organization's
   resources are devoted to the projects. As shown in Figure 1.5, the project team members report
   directly to the project manager, who has a great deal of independence and authority. Along with
   responsibility comes the high level of autonomy over the projects. The project managers are
   happy campers in a projectized organization. A functional organization and a projectized
   organization are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of a project manager's authority.
   A project manager in a projectized organization has the following attributes:
        The project manager is full-time.
        The project manager has full authority over the project team.
        There is full-time administrative staff to help with the project.
   In the middle of the spectrum are the matrix organizations.

          FIGURE 1.5 Structure of a projectized organization. Gray boxes represent staff involved in a pro-
                        ject under a given project manager.


     Matrix Organization
        A matrix organization is organized into functional departments, but a project is run by a pro-
        ject team, with members coming from different functional departments, as shown in Figure 1.6.
        On the spectrum of a project manager's authority, matrix organizations are in the middle of two
        extremes: functional and projectized organizations. The matrix organizations are generally cat-
        egorized into a strong matrix, which is closer to projectized structure; a weak matrix, which is
        closer to functional structure; and a balanced matrix, which is in the middle of strong and weak.

    You have learned how the five process groups (the different stages in the project lifecycle) and
    nine project management knowledge areas constitute the project management framework.
    The actual implementation of project management is greatly influenced by the facts on the
    ground--the organizational structure, for example. Throughout the book, you will be explor-
    ing the details of project management, and getting introduced to some advanced concepts up
    front will make that journey more pleasant and smoother.



Advanced Concepts
    Throughout this book, you will be encountering concepts such as probability, baseline, project
    team, and project management team. Those concepts are introduced in the following sections.


Probability
    The theory of probability has its early seventeenth-century roots in the investigations of games
    of chance, such as roulette and cards. Since then, a multitude of mathematicians and scientists
    have contributed to the development of the theory of probability. Today, the concepts of prob-
    ability appear in almost every discipline, ranging from physics to project management. In the
    modern age, probability has already entered into the folk psyche through phrases such as,
    "What are the odds that this will happen?"
    Probability. Probability is defined as a chance that something will happen. For example, when
    you play the lottery and you wonder what the odds are that you will win, you are thinking of
    probability. The simplest example of probability is tossing a coin. The question is, when you
    toss a coin, what is the probability that the coin will land heads-up? When you toss a coin,
24     Chapter 1     PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


        there are only two possibilities: It will land either heads-up or tails-up. Each possibility is
        equally likely if you are not cheating. Therefore, the probability that the coin will land heads-
        up is 1 out of 2, or 50 percent, or 0.5. In general, if there are n possible outcomes of an event
        and each outcome is equally likely, then the probability of a specific outcome is 1/n.
        Random variable. A random variable can acquire any value within a given range or out
        of a set of values. For example, you can use a random variable to represent the results of rolling
        a fair die, which has six sides numbered by dots from 1 to 6. The possible outcome of
        rolling a die could be any number from the set of outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
        Expected value. This is the expected value of an outcome. As an example, assume you get into
        a bet that you will win $10 if a coin toss results in heads, and you will lose $5 if it results in
        tails. Given that the probability for heads or tails is 0.5 for each, the expected value for the
        money that you will win is $10 * 0.5 = $5, and the expected value for the money that you will
        lose is $5 * 0.5 = $2.5.
        Variance. The variance of a random variable is the deviation from the expected value. It is com-
        puted as the average squared deviation of each number from its mean. For example, assume
        that the values of a random variable are 2, 4, 5, 7, and 2 in five measurements. The mean value
        for these measurements is
                (2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 2) / 5 = 4
        The variance of the spread of these values is
                V = 2 = [(2-4)2 + (4-4)2 + (7-4)2 + (2-4)2 ] / 5 = 3.4
        Standard deviation. This is the square root of the variance--that is, .


     Project Team and Project Management Team
        To avoid confusion, make sure you can distinguish the project team from the project manage-
        ment team. The project management team consists of the individuals who perform the project
        management activities for the project. The project team consists of all the individuals directly
        involved in the project--the individuals who perform the schedule activities; the members of the
        project management team; and perhaps some other stakeholders, such as the project sponsor.


     Baseline
        The project baseline is defined as the approved plan for the cost, schedule, and scope of the
        project. The project performance is measured against this baseline. The project baseline is also
        referred to in terms of its components--cost baseline, schedule baseline, and scope baseline.
        How do you know how the project is performing? You compare the performance against the
        baseline. Approved changes in cost, schedule, and scope will also change the baseline.
        In this chapter, you have learned how project management is performed by applying knowl-
        edge and skills to project activities in order to meet the project objectives. Applying knowledge
        boils down to performing processes.
                                                             SUMMARY                Chapter 1           25


  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
       The project lifecycle consists of five stages: initiating, planning, executing, monitor-
       ing/controlling, and closing. Each of these stages is called a process group due to the
       set of processes that is performed in the stage.
       The project processes that are performed to manage projects constitute nine project
       management knowledge areas: communication management, cost management,
       human resource management, integration management, procurement management,
       quality management, risk management, scope management, and time management.
       A project manager has none to low authority in a functional organization, low to
       high authority in a matrix organization, and high to full authority in a projectized
       organization.



Summary
  The activities inside an organization are generally organized into groups, which fall into two
  categories--operations and projects. Operations usually consist of ongoing routine work,
  whereas a project has a goal to generate a unique product, service, or result in a finite time--
  that is, it has a planned beginning and a planned end. Organizations launch projects for dif-
  ferent reasons, such as to meet a business or legal requirement, or to take on an opportunity
  offered by the market. A project, like anything else in an organization, needs to be managed.
  The project management is the application of knowledge and skills to project activities in
  order to meet the project objectives. It involves performing a set of processes that constitute
  nine knowledge areas of project management: communication management, cost management,
  human resource management, integration management, procurement management, quality
  management, risk management, scope management, and time management. Each process is
  part of a knowledge area and has a membership in one of five process groups: initiating, plan-
  ning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing. The process groups represent different
  stages of a project lifecycle.
  Each project has a set of individuals or organizations that it influences positively or negatively,
  and these individuals and organizations are accordingly called positive and negative stakehold-
  ers. Some of these stakeholders may influence the project. Therefore, you must identify all the
  project stakeholders, positive and negative. The different project stakeholders might have dif-
  ferent and conflicting expectations, which you need to analyze and manage.
  Another big influence factor for the project management is the structure of the performing
  organization, which could be functional, projectized, or matrix. On one end of the spectrum,
  a project manager is usually part-time and has little or no authority in a functional organiza-
  tion. On the other end, the project manager is full-time and has high to full authority in a pro-
  jectized organization. In the middle of the spectrum are the matrix organizations, in which a
  project manger has low to high authority.
26   Chapter 1       PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK


      As you learned in this chapter, the first stage of the project lifecycle is initiating. You will start
      your journey of project management by exploring the initiating stage in the next chapter.


      Exam's Eye View
       Comprehend

        The way PMI views it, the discipline of project management is composed of nine knowledge
            areas, such as project cost management, project scope management, and project human resource
            management.

        Depending upon in which stage of the project lifecycle they are executed, the processes are
            grouped into five process groups, such as the initiating group and the planning group.

        The project manager's authority is none to low in a functional organization, low to high in a
            matrix organization, and high to full in a projectized organization.

       Look Out

        For a work effort to be qualified as a project, it must be temporary (that is, have a start and a fin-
            ish), and the outcome must be a unique product, result, or a service. Routine, ongoing work is an
            operation, not a project.

        Any individual or organization that is positively or negatively affected by a project is a project
            stakeholder. Stakeholders can exist outside of the performing organization.

        You must identify both positive and negative stakeholders of your project, and you must not
            ignore the negative stakeholders.

        Regardless of the structure of the performing organizations, project managers are responsible for
            the project results.

       Memorize

        The lifecycle of a project has five stages, called process groups: initiating, planning, executing, mon-
            itoring/controlling, and closing.

        All the processes that are executed at different stages of a project belong to nine knowledge areas:
            communication management, cost management, human resource management, integration man-
            agement, procurement management, quality management, risk management, scope management,
            and time management. A given process belongs to only one knowledge area.

     knowledge area. A knowledge area in project management is defined by its knowl-
        edge requirements related to managing a specific aspect of a project, such as cost, by
        using a set of processes. PMI recognizes a total of nine knowledge areas, such as cost
        management and human resource management.
        organization. A group of individuals organized to work for some purpose or mission.
        performing organization. The organization that is performing the project.
        process. A set of interrelated activities performed to obtain a specified set of prod-
        ucts, results, or services.
        program. A set of related projects managed in a coordinated fashion to improve the
        overall efficiency and effectiveness.
        program management. The centralized coordinated management of a specific pro-
        gram to achieve its strategic goals, objectives, and benefits.
        program management office (PMO). Program management office (or project man-
        agement office) refers to an entity in an organization that is responsible for provid-
        ing centralized coordinated management for programs--that is, projects in the
        organization.
        project. A work effort made over a finite period of time, with a start and a finish, to
        create a unique product, service, or result. A process consists of three elements:
        input, tools and techniques, and output.
        project management. Application of knowledge, skills, and tools and techniques to
        project activities in order to meet project objectives. You do this by performing some
        processes at various stages of the project.
        project stakeholder. An individual or an organization that is positively or negatively
        affected by the project.

Introduction
  As you learned in the previous chapter, you manage projects through processes. A process is
  composed of input, tools and techniques, and output. You use the tools and techniques on the
  input of a process to generate its output. You manage the initiation of a project through a
  process group called the initiating process group, which consists of two processes: developing a
  project charter and developing a preliminary project scope statement. Before you can initiate a
  project, it must originate from somewhere.
  So the central question in this chapter is, how is a project initiated? In search of the answer,
  you will explore three avenues with me: the origins of projects, the project charter, and the pre-
  liminary project scope statement.



Origins of Projects
  Before you can begin the project initiation process, someone must request the project. So where
  do the projects originally come from? Projects are often originated from sources external to the
  project management office--for example, internally, by some department of the company, or
  externally, by an enterprise or a government agency. A project may originate as a result of one
  or more of the following categories of reasons.
       Business requirements. This category includes projects based on a business need or
       a legal requirement. For example, perhaps a Web design company authorizes a pro-
       ject to automate certain aspects of maintaining Web sites to increase efficiency and
       revenue. As another example, consider a building owner authorizing a project to
       make the building accessible to physically disabled persons in order to meet the legal
       requirements for using the building for a specific business.
       Opportunities. The projects that fall into this category might include those based
       on a customer request, a market demand, or a breakthrough in technology. For
       example, several electronics companies authorized projects to manufacture MP3
       players following the invention and popularity of MP3 technology.
       Problems. Projects are also authorized to offer solutions to certain problems in a
       company or a country, or to address social needs in a society. For example, the gov-
       ernment might start a project to help the victims of a natural disaster, such as a hur-
       ricane. A company might authorize a project to analyze the problem of low
       employee productivity and to design a solution for this problem.
                    UNDERSTANDING PROJECT SELECTION                                   Chapter 2           31


   The sources of the project requests can vary widely in different organizations. Depending
   upon your organization, the origins of projects might be inside the organization, outside the
   organization, or both.
   So a project can originate from multiple possible sources. Not all requested projects are autho-
   rized by the organization, however. How does an organization decide which projects to select?



Understanding Project Selection
   A project can be selected by using one or more project selection methods that fall into three
   categories: benefit measurement methods, constrained optimization methods, and expert
   judgment.


Benefit Measurement Methods
   These methods use comparative approaches to compare the benefits obtained from the candi-
   date projects so that the project with the maximum benefit will be selected. These methods fall
   into three categories: scoring models, benefit contributions, and economic models.


   Scoring Models
   A scoring model evaluates projects by using a set of criteria with a weight (score) assigned to
   each criterion. You can assign different weights to different criteria to represent the varied
   degree of importance given to various criteria. All projects are evaluated (scored) against this
   set of criteria, and the project with the maximum score is selected. The set of criteria can include
   both objective and subjective criteria, such as financial data, organizational expertise, market
   value, innovation, and fit with the corporate culture. The advantage of a scoring model is that
   you have the freedom to assign different weights to different criteria in order to select projects
   consistent with the goals, mission, and vision of your corporation. This freedom, however, is
   also a disadvantage because your selection is only as good as the criteria with larger weights.
   Furthermore, developing a good scoring model is a difficult task that requires unbiased cross-
   departmental feedback from different levels of the organization.


   Benefit Contributions
   These methods are based on comparing the benefit contributions from different projects. These
   contributions can be estimated by performing a cost benefit analysis, which typically calculates
   the projected cost, revenue, and savings of a project. This method favors the projects that cre-
   ate profit in the shortest time and ignores the long-term benefits of projects that might not be
   tangible at the current time, such as innovation and strategic values.
32   Chapter 2    INITIATING THE PROJECT


      Economic Models
      An economic model is used to estimate the economic efficiency of a project, and it involves a
      set of calculations to provide overall financial data about the project. The common terms
      involved in economic models are explained in the following list.
           Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR). This is the value obtained by dividing the benefit by the
           cost. The greater the value, the more attractive the project is. For example, if the
           projected cost of producing a product is $20,000, and you expect to sell it for
           $60,000, then the BCR is equal to $60,000/$20,000, which is equal to 3. For the
           benefit to exceed cost, the BCR must be greater than 1.
           Cash flow. Whereas cash refers to money, cash flow refers to both the money com-
           ing in and the money going out of an organization. Positive cash flow means more
           money coming in than going out. Cash inflow is benefit (income), and cash outflow
           is cost (expenses).
           Internal Return Rate (IRR). This is just another way of interpreting the benefit
           from the project. It looks at the cost of the project as the capital investment and
           translates the profit into the interest rate over the life of that investment. Calcula-
           tions for IRR are out of the scope of this book. Just understand that the greater the
           value for IRR, the more beneficial the project is.
           Present Value (PV) and Net Present Value (NPV). To understand these two con-
           cepts, understand that one dollar today can buy you more than what one dollar next
           year can buy. (Think about inflation and return.) The issue arises because it takes
           time to complete a project, and even when a project is completed its benefits are
           reaped over a period of time, not immediately. In other words, the project is costing
           you today but will benefit you tomorrow. So, to make an accurate calculation for the
           profit, the cost and benefits must be converted to the same point in time. The NPV
           of a project is the present value of the future cash inflows (benefits) minus the pre-
           sent value of the current and future cash outflows (cost). For a project to be worth-
           while economically, the NPV must be positive. As an example, assume you invest
           $300,000 today to build a house, which will be completed and sold after three years
           for $500,000. Also assume that real estate that is worth $400,000 today will be
           worth $500,000 after three years. So the present value of the cash inflow on your
           house is $400,000, and hence the NPV is the present value of the cash inflow minus
           the present value of the cash outflow, which equals $400,000-$300,000, which
           equals $100,000.
           Opportunity cost. This refers to selecting a project over another due to the scarcity
              of resources. In other words, by spending this dollar on this project, you are passing
              on the opportunity to spend this dollar on another project. How big an opportunity
              are you missing? The smaller the opportunity cost, the better it is.
                    UNDERSTANDING PROJECT SELECTION                                Chapter 2          33


        Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). The discounted cash flow refers to the amount that
        someone is willing to pay today in anticipation of receiving the cash flow in the
        future. DCF is calculated by taking the amount that you anticipate receiving in the
        future and discounting (converting) it back to today on the time scale. This conver-
        sion factors in the interest rate and opportunity cost between now (when you are
        spending cash) and the time when you will receive the cash back.
        Return on Investment (ROI). The ROI is the percentage profit from the project.
        For example, if you spend $400,000 on the project, and the benefit for the first year
        is $500,000, then ROI equals ($500,000-$400,000)/$400,000, which equals 25%.
   The details and calculations for these quantities are out of the scope of this book. Just under-
   stand the basic concepts and whether a larger or a smaller value for a given quantity favors the
   project selection.
   As the name suggests, all the benefit measurement methods are based on calculating some
   kind of benefit from the given project. However, the benefit will never be realized if the pro-
   ject fails. This concern has given rise to methods based on calculating the success of the pro-
   jects; these methods are called constrained optimization methods.


Constrained Optimization Methods
   Constrained optimization methods are concerned with predicting the success of the project.
   These methods are based on complex mathematical models that use formulae and algorithms
   to predict the success of a project. These models use the following kinds of algorithms:
           Linear
           Nonlinear
           Dynamic
           Integer
           Multiple objective programming



                TIP
         For the exam, you need to know two things about constrained optimization methods:
         the names of the types of the algorithms and that these methods are only used for
         complex projects, and therefore are not typically used for most projects.


   The details of these models are out of the scope of this book.
   Either in conjunction with other methods or in absence of them, organizations often rely on
   expert judgment in making selection decisions.
34     Chapter 2     INITIATING THE PROJECT


     Expert Judgment
        Expert judgment is one of the techniques used in project management to accomplish various
        tasks, including project selection. It refers to making a decision by relying on expert advice from
        one or more of the following sources:
                An appropriate unit within the organization
                The project stakeholders, including customers and sponsors
                Consultants
                Professional and technical associations
                Industry groups
        The use of expert judgment is not limited to the project selection; it can be used in many
        processes, such as developing a project charter. Keep in mind that expert judgment can be very
        subjective at times and might include political influence. An excellent salesperson or an exec-
        utive with great influence can exploit this method successfully.
        An organization might use multiple selection methods to make a decision. During the project
        selection process, you might start interacting with a very important group of people called
        project stakeholders.



     Identifying the Project Stakeholders
        Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively
        or negatively) by the project's execution and completion. In other words, a project stakeholder
        has something to gain from the project or something to lose to the project. Accordingly, the
        stakeholders fall into two categories: positive stakeholders, who will normally benefit from the
        success of the project, and negative stakeholders, who see some kind of disadvantage coming
        from the project. The implications obviously are that the positive stakeholders would like to
        see the project succeed and the negative stakeholders' interests will be better served if the pro-
        ject is delayed or cancelled altogether. For example your city mayor might be a positive stake-
        holder in a project to open a Wal-Mart store in your neighborhood because it brings business
        to the city, whereas some local business leaders might look at it as a threat to the local busi-
        nesses and thereby may act as negative stakeholders.
        Negative stakeholders are often overlooked by the project manager and the project team,
        which increases the project risk. Ignoring positive or negative project stakeholders will have a
        damaging impact on the project. Therefore, it's important that you, as a project manager, start
        identifying the project stakeholders early on in the project. The different project stakeholders
        might have different and conflicting expectations that you need to analyze and manage.
                         DEVELOPING A PROJECT CHARTER                               Chapter 2           35


  Identifying all the project stakeholders might be a difficult task, but the following are the obvi-
  ous ones:
       Project manager. Include yourself, the project manager, in the list of the stakeholders.
       Project Management Office (PMO). If your organization has PMO that is directly
          or indirectly responsible for the outcome of a project, then the PMO is a stakeholder
          in that project.
          Project management team. These are the members of the project team involved in
          the project management tasks.
          Project team members. The members of the project team that are actually perform-
          ing the work are also the project stakeholders.
          Performing organization. The organization whose employees are doing the project
          work is a stakeholder organization.
          Customer/user. Customer/users include the individual or the organization for
          whom the project is being performed and the users who will use the product that
          will result from successful completion of the project.
          Project sponsor. The sponsor is the individual or group that provides financial
          resources for the project.
          Influencers. These are the individuals or groups who are not direct customers or
          users of the product or service that will come from the project, but who can influ-
          ence the course of the project due to their positions in the customer or performing
          organization. The influence can be positive or negative--that is, for or against the
          project.
  In addition to these key stakeholders, which are obvious to identify, there can be a number of
  other less obvious stakeholders inside and outside of your organization. Depending upon the
  project, these might include investors, sellers, contractors, family members of the project team
  members, government agencies, media outlets, lobbying organizations, individual citizens, and
  society at large.
  It is critical for the success of the project that you identify positive and negative stakeholders
  early on in the project, understand and analyze their varying and conflicting expectations, and
  manage those expectations throughout the project.
  The project initiation process group includes two processes: developing a project charter and
  developing a preliminary project scope statement.



Developing a Project Charter
  The single most important task for the develop project charter process is to authorize a pro-
  ject. To accomplish that, it is necessary to document the business needs and the new product
  or service that the project will launch to satisfy those needs. This way, the project charter links
  the proposed project to the ongoing work in the organization and clears the way to authorize
  the project.
36     Chapter 2     INITIATING THE PROJECT



                     NOTE
              The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project, which includes
              naming the project manager and determining his or her authority level.


        The output of the develop project charter process is of course the project charter, and this out-
        put is generated by applying the tools and techniques to the input of this process, as shown in
        Figure 2.1.




            FIGURE 2.1 Developing the project charter: input, tools and techniques, and output


     Input to Developing the Project Charter
        Like any other process, the develop project charter process also has input. The input comes
        from the origin of the project and from within the organization that will perform the project.
        The possible input items for the process of developing a project charter are the following:
        Contract. A project for a customer who is external to the performing organization is usually
        done based on a contract.
        Statement of Work (SOW). The statement of work describes the products or services that will
        be delivered by the project. For an internal project the SOW is provided by the project initia-
        tor or the project sponsor, whereas for an external project the SOW is received from the cus-
        tomer as part of a bid document, such as a request for proposals, a request for bids, or a contract.
        The SOW includes business needs that the project will satisfy, the product scope, and a strate-
        gic plan.

Enterprise environmental factors. During the development of the project charter, you must
consider the performing organization's environmental factors, which include the following:
     Commercial databases, such as standardized cost estimating data and risk databases
     The culture and structure of the performing organization
     Government and industry standards, such as legal requirements, product standards,
     and quality standards relevant to the project
     Human resources currently available in the organization, such as skills and expertise
     Infrastructure, such as facilities and equipment to do the project
     Marketplace conditions relevant to the project
     Personnel administration information, such as guidelines for hiring, firing, and per-
     formance reviews
     Project management information systems, such as software tools for scheduling tasks
     and meetings
     Risk tolerances of the project stakeholders
     Work authorization system of the organization, because the project needs to be
     authorized
Note that the environmental factors can be internal to the performing organization, such as
the organization's culture, or external to the organization, such as market conditions.
Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets are typically grouped into
two categories: processes and procedures for conducting work, and a corporate knowledge base
for storing and retrieving information. For example, the performing organization might have
its own guidelines, policies, and procedures, whose effect on the project must be considered
while developing the project charter and other project documents that will follow. Another
example of an organization's process assets are the knowledge and learning base acquired from
the previous projects. Here are some specific examples from the organizational process assets:
     Project closure guidelines and requirements
     Templates to support some project management tasks, such as risk, project schedule
     network diagrams, and work breakdown structure
     Procedures for defect management
     Procedures for issuing work authorizations
     Defect management database systems that allow one to enter a defect and monitor
     its status
You take the available input and apply the relevant tools and techniques to develop the project
charter.

     Tools and Techniques for Developing the Project Charter
        Like any other process, the develop project charter process requires that some tools and tech-
        niques be applied to the input to produce output. Exactly which tools and techniques will be
        used depends upon the specific project at hand. Following is a list of types of tools and tech-
        niques that can be used to develop the charter.
             Project selection methods. These methods were discussed previously in this chapter.
             Project management methodology. A project management methodology defines a
             set of project management process groups and the processes in each group. These
             processes can be the standard formal processes or informal techniques in your orga-
             nization. This methodology must be kept in mind in preparing the project charter.
             Project management information systems. This is a set of project management
             tools organized into an integrated system that automates some tasks of developing
             the project charter, such as facilitating feedback, refining the project charter docu-
             ment, controlling changes to the document, and releasing the approved document.
             Expert judgment. Expert judgment, a method used to evaluate the input to devel-
             oping the project charter, was discussed previously in this chapter.
        These tools and techniques are used on the input to develop the project charter.


     Output of Developing the Project Charter
        The output of the develop project charter process is a formal document called the project
        charter. It is a high-level document that summarizes the business needs, the understanding of
        customer requirements, and how the new product or service will satisfy these requirements. To
        be specific, the project charter should include the following information.
             The project justification, which includes the purpose of the project and the business
                case for the project, which in turn may include return on investment
             A project description that includes the business needs that the project addresses and
                the high-level product requirements
                Project requirements based on the needs of the customer, the sponsor, and other
                stakeholders
                A list of participating functional departments of the organization and their roles in
                the project
                Organizational, environmental, and external assumptions and constraints
                A summary of the high-level schedule, including milestones
                A budget summary
                An assigned project manager, a specified authority level for that project manager,
                and defined stakeholder influences
                       DEVELOPING A PROJECT CHARTER                               Chapter 2          39


An assumption is a factor that you consider to be true without any proof or verification. For
example, an obvious assumption that you might make during planning for an in-house project
could be the availability of the required skill set to perform the project.
It's important to document assumptions clearly and validate them at various stages of the pro-
ject because assumptions carry a certain degree of uncertainty with them, and uncertainty
means risk. Assumptions can appear in both the input and the output of various processes.
A constraint is a restriction (or a limitation) that can affect the performance of the project. It
can appear both in the input and the output of various processes. For example, there could be
a schedule constraint that the project must be completed by a predetermined date. Similarly, a
cost constraint would limit the budget available for the project.
The project charter provides the project manager with the authority to use organizational
resources to run the project. Remember that formally speaking, project charters are prepared
external to project management by an individual or a committee in the organization. In
other words, project management starts where the project charter ends. However, practically,
the would-be project manager might actually be involved in writing the project charter or a
part of it. The project approval and funding will still be external to the project management
boundaries.


             NOTE
      Some organizations might perform a feasibility study or its equivalent to justify the
      project before developing the project charter and initiating the project. The feasibility
      study may itself become a project.


Once you have the project charter, you know the high-level product (or service) requirements
that the project will satisfy. However, a high-level requirement written in a certain way might
mean different things to different stakeholders. So after you get the project charter, your first
task is to develop a common understanding of the project among the project stakeholders. You
accomplish this by drawing boundaries around the project--that is, what is included and what
is not--thereby spelling out what exactly the deliverables are. By doing this, you are deter-
mining the scope of the project.


             NOTE
      If a project includes multiple phases, the initiation process may be performed at the
      beginning of each phase to validate the assumptions made during the previous
      phases.
40     Chapter 2     INITIATING THE PROJECT



     Developing a Preliminary Project
     Scope Statement
        Project scope is defined as the work that must be performed to deliver a product, service, or results
        with specified features and functions. The scope specifies what is included and what is not. It
        is equivalent to drawing boundaries around the project and its products and services. You
        accomplish this as part of the initiation process group by writing a formal document called a
        preliminary project scope statement, which is the output of the process called develop preliminary
        project scope statement, as shown in Figure 2.2.




            FIGURE 2.2 Developing a preliminary project scope statement: input, tools and techniques,
                           and output

        The project charter is one of the items that act as input to the develop a preliminary project
        scope statement process.


     Input to Developing the Preliminary Project Scope Statement
        The following items are the input to the develop a preliminary project scope statement process.
                The project charter
                The statement of work
                The enterprise environment factors
                The organizational process assets
        All these items were discussed previously in this chapter. Note that the statement of work, the
        enterprise environment factors, and the organizational process assets are input items to both
        developing the project charter and developing the preliminary project scope statement.
        To develop the scope statement, you apply the tools and techniques discussed in the next sec-
        tion to this input.

Tools and Techniques for Developing the Preliminary
Project Scope Statement
    The tools and techniques used to develop the scope statement are listed here.
         Project management methodology, discussed earlier, defines a process that helps in
         developing a preliminary project scope statement and controlling changes to it.
         Project management information systems, discussed earlier, help to accomplish the
         following:
          Generate the scope statement document.
          Facilitate feedback to refine the document.
          Control changes to the document.
          Release the final approved document.
          Expert judgment, discussed earlier, can be applied to technical and management
             details included in the scope statement.
    Note that project management methodology, project management information systems, and
    expert judgment can be applied to both developing the project charter and developing the pre-
    liminary project scope statement.You apply these tools and techniques to produce a formal doc-
    ument called the preliminary project scope statement.


The Preliminary Project Scope Statement
    The preliminary project scope statement is naturally the output of the develop a preliminary
    project scope statement process: one of the two processes in the initiating process group. The
    main purpose of the scope statement is to define the scope of the project. Accordingly, the two
    main elements included in the scope statement but not in the project charter are the project
    scope and the scope change control. To be specific, the following items are included in the pre-
    liminary scope statement:
         Objectives of the project and the product (or service) that the project will deliver.
         Project assumptions and constraints.
         Requirements and characteristics of the product or service that the project will
            deliver, and the specific project deliverables.
         Product (or service) acceptance criteria.
         Project boundaries: what is included and what is not.
         Initial work breakdown structure (WBS), which will be discussed in the following
         chapter.
         Scheduled milestones.
         Initial project team.
         Initial defined risks.
42    Chapter 2     INITIATING THE PROJECT


            Project configuration management requirements. The configuration management
            includes formal documented procedures in the organization, the change control sys-
            tem, and an auditing system that can be used to audit the products, services, or com-
            ponents to verify their conformance to requirements.
            Cost estimate in order of magnitude.


                    NOTE
             An order of magnitude estimate is an approximation rounded to the nearest power of
             10. For example, with an accuracy of one order of magnitude, the exact value for the
             number 300 could be anywhere between 250 and 350, and the exact value for the
             number 3,000 could be anywhere between 2,500 and 3,500.


       A project with a poorly defined scope is an ill-defined project on the path to failure. The pre-
       liminary project scope statement, in addition to the project charter, accomplishes the follow-
       ing three things:
            Defining the project scope
            Defining the project change control
            Developing a common understanding of the project among all the stakeholders by
               defining the project scope and the project change control
       Remember that the project scope statement at this stage is a preliminary statement that will
       be refined in the scope definition process discussed in Chapter 3.
       So, the project charter and the preliminary project statement are the two important documents
       of the project initiating stage. However, the project does not initiate until the project charter
       is approved.



     Obtaining Project Charter Approval
       The single most important outcome of the project initiation process group is the project char-
       ter approval. In other words, a project is initiated through an approval of the project charter by
       an appropriate person in the performing organization. Who this person is depends on the orga-
       nization and the project. This person, for example, could be the CEO of the company, the pro-
       ject sponsor, or a representative of the project selection committee.
                                                              SUMMARY                Chapter 2           43


  Issuing an approved project charter and developing a preliminary project scope statement moves
  the project from the initiation stage into the planning stage.
  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
       A project can originate inside the performing organization or outside of it, in order to
          meet business requirements, take on an opportunity, or offer a solution to a problem.
       The project charter names the project manager and determines authority level of the
       project manager.
       The preliminary project scope statement takes the project understanding to the next
       level by specifying the project scope and the project change control, and thereby
       helps to get the stakeholders on the same page.



Summary
  Organizations start projects for different reasons, such as to meet a business or legal require-
  ment, to take on a business opportunity, or to develop a solution for a problem. Three cate-
  gories of methods are available to select from the proposed projects. The first type of method
  is the benefit measurement method, which evaluates the benefits from the projects. Constrained
  optimization methods focus on the probability of completing the projects successfully, and
  expert judgment relies on expert advice. As a project manager, you need to identify each stake-
  holder: an individual or an organization that is going to gain or lose from the successful com-
  pletion of the project.
  The two output items of the initiation process group are the project charter, which names and
  authorizes the project manager, and the preliminary scope statement, which outlines the scope
  of the project. The project charter also includes project justification based on the business needs
  and a high-level description of the product or service that the project will offer to meet those
  business needs. The preliminary project scope statement takes the project understanding to the
  next level by specifying project scope and project change control, which helps to get the stake-
  holders on the same page.
  Issuing an approved project charter and developing a preliminary project scope statement move
  the project from the initiation stage into the planning stage, which is composed of a number
  of processes collectively called the planning process group. I will discuss the processes related to
  scope planning in the next chapter.
44   Chapter 2      INITIATING THE PROJECT


      Exam's Eye View
       Comprehend

        The project manager and project sponsor are also project stakeholders.
        A contract can be an input item for developing the project charter, but not for developing the
           preliminary project scope statement.

        The project charter is an input item to developing the preliminary scope statement, not vice
           versa.

        The initial assumptions and constraints about a project are listed in the project charter.

       Look Out

        The statement of work can be an input item to both the project charter and the preliminary
           scope statement.

        A project stakeholder is an individual or organization that has anything to gain or lose from
           the successful completion of the project. It could be anyone from the CEO of the performing
           organization to an ordinary citizen.

       Memorize

        Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively
           or negatively) by the project execution and completion.

        The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project, which includes naming
           a project manager.

        Constrained optimization methods used for project selection use these kinds of algorithms:
           linear, nonlinear, dynamic, integer, and multiple objective programming.

        These tools and techniques are used in developing both the project charter and the prelimi-
           nary project scope statement: expert judgment, project management information systems, and
           project management methodology.

        These input items are used to develop both the project charter and the preliminary project
           scope statement: statement of work, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational
           process assets.

Introduction
  After the project has been initiated, as discussed in the previous chapter, you need to develop
  a project management plan, which becomes the primary source of information for how the pro-
  ject at hand will be planned, executed, controlled, and closed. One component of the project
  management plan is planning the project scope, which you will explore in this chapter. The
  primary purpose of project scope management is to ensure that the required work (and only
  the required work) is performed to complete the project successfully. If changes in the work
  requirements are made, they must be controlled--that is, the scope must be controlled.
  Before you start defining the scope, you need to know how to do so. In other words, you need
  to develop a scope management plan. Once you have defined the scope, it needs to be broken
  down into concrete, manageable tasks that can be assigned and performed. This is accomplished
  through what is called the work breakdown structure (WBS).
  The central issue in this chapter is planning for the project scope. To be able to put your arms
  around this issue, you will explore three avenues: project scope management plan, scope defi-
  nition, and WBS. The scope management plan is the part of the project management plan I
  will introduce first.



Creating the Project Management Plan
  Once the project has been initiated, it is time to do some planning. Project planning starts
  with the process of developing a project management plan, which defines, prepares, coordi-
  nates, and integrates all subsidiary plans, such as scope and risk management plans, into one
  plan called the project management plan. The goal here is to develop a source of information that
  will work as a guideline for how the project will be planned, executed, controlled, and closed.
  One reason why it is important to develop a project management plan is that not all the pro-
  jects need all the planning processes, and to the same degree. Therefore, the content of the
  project management plan will depend upon a specific project. As the project goes through dif-
  ferent stages, the project management plan may be updated and revised through the change
  control process. Following is an incomplete list of issues that a project management plan
  addresses.
       Which project management processes will be used for this process, what the level of
       implementation for each of these processes will be, and what the inputs and tools
       and techniques for these processes are
       How the changes will be monitored and controlled
                                                MANAGING SCOPE                    Chapter 3           51


       What the needs and techniques for communication among the stakeholders are
       How the project lifecycle looks, including the project phases if the project is a multi-
          phase project
  Depending upon the complexity of the project, the project management plan can be either
  a summary or a collection of subsidiary plans and components, which might include the
  following:
       Standard plans from the project planning process group, such as the cost manage-
       ment plan, communication management plan, process scope management plan, and
       risk management plan.
       Other components, such as the milestones list, resource calendar, and baselines for
       schedule, cost, and quality. A baseline is a reference plan against which all the per-
       formance deviations are measured. This reference plan can be the original or the
       updated plan.
  The process of developing the project management plan falls in the knowledge area of inte-
  gration management because it coordinates the various processes and activities. Therefore,
  project management processes, in addition to the preliminary project scope statement, are the
  obvious inputs to this process. The other inputs are enterprise environmental factors and orga-
  nizational process assets. To develop the project management plan, you apply the following
  tools and techniques to this input: expert judgment, project management information systems,
  and project management methodology.
  One of the crucial parts of managing any project is scope management, which is discussed next.



Managing Scope
  The scope of a project is defined as the work that must be performed to deliver the required
  results (products or services) of a project. It is about both what is included in the project and
  what is not. In other words, scoping a project means drawing boundaries around it. The
  importance of managing the project scope cannot be overemphasized because it has a pro-
  found impact on the overall success of the project.
  The major goal of scope management is to ensure that the required work (and only the required
  work) is included and performed in the project. This is accomplished by using the processes
  shown in Figure 3.1 and discussed as follows:
       Scope planning. This is used to determine the how of the scope management: how
       to define, control, and verify the project scope, and how to define and create a work
       breakdown structure (WBS).
       Scope definition. This is used to develop the detailed project scope statement.
       Create WBS. This is used to break down the project deliverables into manageable
       tasks that can be assigned to team members. These tasks are called work packages.

                         ed in scope management

            Scope verification. This is used to formalize the acceptance of the completed pro-
            ject deliverables.
            Scope control. This is used to control changes to the project scope.
       The scope control and scope verification processes are parts of the monitoring and controlling
       process group; therefore, they are covered in Chapter 7, "Monitoring and Controlling Projects."
       The other three processes are explored in this chapter.
       Before you can define, control, and verify the scope, you need to determine how to do it for
       the project at hand. This is accomplished by developing the project scope management plan.



     Developing the Project Scope
     Management Plan
       By now you have three documents--two from the initiating stage, namely the project charter
       and the preliminary scope statement, and one from the planning stage, namely the project man-
       agement plan. You use these three documents as input to develop the project scope manage-
       ment plan.
       The process for developing the project scope management plan is shown in Figure 3.2.
DEVELOPING THE PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN                                            Chapter 3    53




       FIGURE 3.2 The scope planning process: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input for Scope Planning
   The project charter and preliminary project scope statement developed in the initiation stage,
   along with the project management plan developed in the beginning of the planning stage,
   work as input to the scope planning process.
   The enterprise environment factors, discussed in Chapter 2, should also be considered when
   developing the project scope management plan. The performing organization's culture, avail-
   ability of human resources and tools, infrastructure, personnel policies, and market conditions
   can have an impact on how project scope will be managed.
   Furthermore, the organizational process assets, discussed in Chapter 2, can also influence how
   the project scope will be managed. The following process assets are of special interest to the
   scope planning:
        The relevant historical information in the knowledge base of the organization to
        make use of the lessons learned from the scope planning of previous projects
        Organizational policies related to scope planning and scope management
        Organizational procedures related to scope planning and scope management
   You use some tools and techniques on this input to hammer out the project scope manage-
   ment plan.


Tools and Techniques for Scope Planning
   While planning the scope, expert judgment can be used based on how the scope was planned
   and managed in similar projects performed in the past.
54     Chapter 3    PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE


        The following tools can also be useful:
             Templates, such as scope management plan templates and WBS templates.
             Project scope change control forms. You can select which of the existing forms to
             use for the given project or you can develop new ones.
             Standards that the organization follows regarding scope planning and scope man-
             agement. You can determine which of these standards applies to the given project.
        You use these tools and techniques on the input to iron out the project scope management
        plan--in other words, the output of the scope planning process.


     Output of Scope Planning
        The purpose of the scope planning is to develop a project scope management plan that will
        provide guidance on how to define, verify, and control the project scope. Accordingly, the out-
        put of the scope planning provides the answers to the three questions described here:
             How can you define the scope? To answer this question, the scope management
             plan includes the following:
              A process to prepare a detailed project scope statement based on the preliminary
                 project scope statement.
              A process that will enable the creation of the work breakdown structure (WBS)
                 from the detailed project scope statement and will establish how the WBS will
                 be maintained and approved.
             How can you verify the scope? The scope management plan answers this question
             by including a process that describes how the formal verification and acceptance of
             the completed project deliverables will be obtained.
             How can you control the scope? The scope management plan answers this question
             by including a process that specifies how the requests for changes to the detailed
             project scope statement (which we also refer to as the scope statement) will be
             processed.
        The project scope management plan becomes part of the project management plan.



                    TIP
              Whether the project scope management plan is informal and high-level (without too
              much detail) or formal and detailed depends upon the size, complexity, and needs of
              the project.


        So the project scope management plan specifies how to define, verify, and control the project.
        With this plan in place, you are ready to define the scope.
                                DEFINING THE PROJECT SCOPE                          Chapter 3          55


Defining the Project Scope
    Recall that the preliminary project scope statement that you developed in the project initiation
    stage contained the major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. You build on these ele-
    ments to develop the detailed project scope statement, one component of the scope definition.
    Now that the project is in the planning stage, you have more information than you had in the
    initiation stage. Therefore, you are in a better position to analyze the needs and expectations
    related to the project and convert them into requirements. Furthermore, the assumptions and
    constraints can be revisited and analyzed at greater length, and additional assumptions and con-
    straints can be identified. This will help to define the project scope with more clarity and
    specificity.
    Figure 3.3 presents the process of defining scope. You apply tools and techniques to the input
    to develop the output of the scope definition process.




        FIGURE 3.3 Scope definition: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input to Scope Definition
    The project scope management plan will guide you on how to develop the project scope defi-
    nition, while the project charter and the preliminary project scope statement will provide the
    initial content for the scope definition. You should also consider the organizational process
    assets, such as standards and policies of the performing organization, relevant to defining the
    project scope.
    Another important input to defining the project scope is the approved change request. When
    the project is being performed, any change request to it will need to go through an approval
    process. When a change request has been approved, it is your responsibility to document the
    change in the project scope due to the approved change request.
    Once you have input for the scope definition, you apply the tools and techniques discussed next
    to define (or redefine) the project scope.
56     Chapter 3    PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE


     Tools and Techniques for Scope Definition
        This section discusses tools and techniques used in the scope definition process.
             Identification of alternatives. This is a technique used to apply nonstandard
                approaches to perform project work, in this case to define the project scope. A host
                of general management techniques can be used in this category; the most common
                ones are brainstorming and lateral thinking. Brainstorming is a creative technique
                generally used in a group environment to gather ideas as candidates for a solution to
                a problem or an issue. The evaluation and analysis of these ideas happens later. Lat-
                eral thinking is synonymous with thinking outside the box. The idea is to think
                beyond the realm of your experience to search for new solutions and methods, not
                just better uses of the current ones.
             Expert judgment. You can use help from relevant experts in the organization to
             develop parts of the detailed project scope.
             Product analysis. To hammer out the details of the project scope, you might need to
             perform product analysis, which might include techniques such as product break-
             down and system analysis. The goal is to translate the project objectives to tangible
             deliverables and requirements. Each application area has different product analysis
             methods to accomplish this.
             Stakeholder analysis. This includes identifying the needs, wants, and expectations
             of the various stakeholders and prioritizing them according to the stakeholders'
             influence. The goal here is to quantify the interests of the stakeholders into concrete
             requirements. For example, what does customer satisfaction mean? Unless you quan-
             tify it into a feature or a deliverable, it is a vague and uncertain concept, and with
             uncertainty comes risk.
        You apply one of these tools or techniques to the input to hammer out the output of the scope
        definition process.


     Output of Scope Definition
        Depending on the input, the scope definition process can generate two kinds of output: the
        detailed project scope statement that contains the original scope definition, and approved
        changes and updates. The project scope statement is a component of the baseline used to man-
        age the change requests to the project.


        Changes and Updates to Scope
        The requested changes that impact the scope become part of the scope definition after they are
        approved through the change control process. After a change request has been approved, you
        should also evaluate its impact on the scope management plan and document the resulting
        changes to the plan.
                           DEFINING THE PROJECT SCOPE                            Chapter 3          57


Project Scope Statement
The key output item of the project definition process is the detailed project scope statement,
which we also refer to as the project scope statement or the scope statement. The scope statement
basically states what needs to be accomplished by the project. It provides a documented basis
for the following:
     Developing a common understanding among the stakeholders about the project
     scope
     Making project decisions throughout the lifecycle of the project
     Measuring performance deviations from the scope
The specific elements of the project are discussed in the following sections.
Project assumptions and constraints. Assumptions and constraints are initially included in
the project charter. However, at this stage, you have more information about the project and
therefore you can revisit the initial assumptions and constraints and you might be able to iden-
tify more assumptions and constraints. You should document the specific assumptions related
to the project scope and also analyze their impact in case they turn out to be false. Due to the
uncertainty built into them, the assumptions are potential sources of risk.
The constraints related to the project scope must also be documented in the scope statement.
Because the constraints limit the team's options, the constraints' impact on the project must be
evaluated. The constraints can come from various sources, such as a predetermined deadline
(also called a hard deadline) for the completion of the project or a milestone, limits on the
funds available for the project, and contractual provisions. However, the following are common
constraints to consider across all projects:
        Quality
        Resources
        Scope
        Time (or schedule)
I will discuss the details about these constraints in Chapter 7.
Project objectives. A project might include a variety of objectives, such as business, schedule,
technical, and quality objectives. A project objective might have attributes assigned to it, such
as cost. The objectives might also include how to measure the success of the project. Success
criteria must be measurable. For example, customer satisfaction and substantial increase in rev-
enue are not measurable criteria, whereas a three-percent increase in revenue is measurable.
Project deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and verifiable product, a capability to provide a
service, or a result that must be produced to complete a project, a process, or a phase of the
project. The deliverables can include project management reports and documents.
58   Chapter 3     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE


      Project requirements. The requirements include the conditions that the project items must
      satisfy, the capabilities that the project items must possess, or both. These requirements fall into
      the following categories:
           Requirements on deliverables. These are the requirements imposed on deliverables
           that might stem from a contract, standard, or specification, or from an analysis of
           stakeholders' needs, wants, and expectations. The scope statement lists the specifica-
           tion documents to which the project must conform.
           Approval requirements. The scope statement also identifies the approval require-
           ments that will be applied to specific items, such as objectives, documents, deliver-
           ables, and work.
           Configuration management requirements. Configuration management refers to
           controlling the characteristics of a product, service, or result of a project. It includes
           documenting the features of a product or a service, controlling and documenting
           changes to the features, and providing support for auditing the products for confor-
           mance to requirements. The project scope statement specifies the level of configura-
           tion management requirements, including change controls to be implemented during
           the project execution.


                   TIP
            You must be able to make a distinction between objectives, deliverables, and require-
            ments. For example, in a project to launch a Web site, the Web site is a deliverable.
            That the Web site must print a warning message at the login time is a requirement,
            and that the Web site should increase the company revenue by three percent is an
            objective.


      Project boundaries. This involves drawing boundaries around the project by specifying what
      is included and what is not, especially focusing on the gray areas where the stakeholders can
      make their own assumptions, different from each other.
      Product description. The scope statement must describe the product scope and the product
      acceptance criteria:
           Product scope description. Product scope is defined as features and functions that
           characterize a product, service, or result to be delivered by the project. Do not con-
           fuse the product scope with the project scope, which is the scope of the whole project
           and is defined as the entire work required to create the project deliverables. Product
           scope and project scope, although related, are different concepts.
           Product acceptance criteria. This defines the process and criteria for accepting the
           completed products that the project will deliver.
                           DEFINING THE PROJECT SCOPE                           Chapter 3           59


Initial project team. The scope statement identifies the project team members and the stake-
holders. The identification of the team members might be at a high level and incomplete at
this stage.
Scheduled milestones. Although the detailed schedule is not in place yet, the customer or the
performing organization can identify milestones and assign deadlines to them. This will, of
course, impose schedule constraints on the project.
Cost estimate. Although an exact cost of the project cannot be calculated at this stage, you can
make a cost estimate and document it. Any fund limitations should also be documented as a
constraint.
Initial risk identification. Although a detailed risk analysis will be performed later, the risks
that can be identified at this stage should be recorded in the scope statement.


             NOTE
      It is important to understand the difference between the project scope and the prod-
      uct scope. As an example, consider the project to launch a Web site. The functional
      Web site with predetermined features is the product scope. The project scope is the
      work that needs to be done to produce this product scope, which includes writing
      software, testing software, putting all the software pieces together on a Web server,
      and making the Web site live.


The project scope statement serves the following purposes:
     It serves as a component to the baseline that will be used to evaluate whether the
        request for a change or additional work falls within or beyond the scope of the project.
     By providing a common understanding of the project scope, the scope statement
        helps bring the stakeholders onto the same page in their expectations.
     Because the scope statement describes the deliverables and the work required to
        create those deliverables, it is used to create a WBS, which helps in scheduling the
        project.
     It serves as a guide for the project team to do more detailed planning, if necessary,
        and to perform work during project execution.
So the project scope statement specifies the scope of the project in terms of the products, ser-
vices, or results with specified features to be delivered by the project. From the perspective of
actually performing the work, the scope statement is still a high-level document. To be able to
schedule the project, identify and assign resources, and manage the project successfully, these
deliverables need to be broken down into manageable tasks. This is accomplished by creating
an entity called the work breakdown structure (WBS).
60    Chapter 3     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE



     Creating a Work Breakdown
     Structure (WBS)
       What is the secret behind accomplishing seemingly impossible tasks in any area? The answer
       is to break down the required work into smaller, manageable pieces. This is also a very impor-
       tant process in project management. To be able to actually execute the project, the project
       scope is broken down into manageable tasks by creating a work breakdown structure (WBS).
       In other words, a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy of the work that must be performed
       to accomplish the objectives of and create the deliverables for the project.
       Figure 3.4 shows the input, tools and techniques, and output of creating the WBS. The pro-
       ject scope statement contains the list of deliverables and objectives, which are the basis for cre-
       ating the WBS. The project scope management plan can provide guidelines on how to create
       the WBS for the project, and you should always consider organizational process assets while
       going through this and several other processes. The approved change requests must also go
       through this process before they become parts of the changes to the WBS.




           FIGURE 3.4 Creating the WBS: input, tools and techniques, and output

       Even though each project is unique, there are similarities among sets of projects in an organi-
       zation. These similarities can be used to prepare templates that will be used as a starting point
       for the WBS, to avoid the duplication of work. With or without templates, you will need to
       go through breaking down the deliverables, a very important step in creating the WBS.
  CREATING A WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)                                              Chapter 3         61


Decomposition
   Decomposition is a technique for subdividing the project deliverables into smaller, manageable
   tasks called work packages. The WBS is a hierarchical structure with work packages at the low-
   est level of each branch. Based on their complexity, different deliverables can have different lev-
   els of decomposition, as shown in the examples presented in Figure 3.5.




      FIGURE 3.5 An example of WBS. The work packages are represented by the dark boxes at the end
                    of each branch. Servlet and Bean refer to the programs that will need to be written.

   You decompose the project work by executing the following steps:
     1. Identify the deliverables and the work involved by analyzing the project scope statement.
     2. Structure and organize the first level (just below the root of the hierarchical tree) of
          the WBS hierarchy. Based on the project at hand, you can use one of the following
          approaches:
             Use the deliverables as the components in the first level.
             Use the phases of the project as the components in the first level.
62     Chapter 3    PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE


                 Use the subprojects as components in the first level. A subproject is a part of the
                   project that is independent enough of the rest of the project that it can be per-
                   formed by another project team. This approach is useful when you want to out-
                   source parts of the project.
               Use different approaches within each branch of WBS--for example, a subpro-
                   ject and deliverables in the first level.
          3. Decompose the upper level into more detailed components for the lower level.
          4. Keep decomposing to lower levels until necessary and sufficient decomposition has
             been achieved.
          5. Assign identification codes to the WBS components.

        As the work is decomposed to lower levels of details, work components become more concrete
        and manageable. However, you should avoid excessive decomposition because it will lead to a
        large number of work packages and it will not be possible to manage all of them effectively. In
        other words, excessive decomposition leads to inefficient use of management and other
        resources. Necessary and sufficient decomposition is the key.



                    TIP
              During decomposition, the components are defined in terms of how the project work
              will actually be executed and controlled. You must verify the correctness of the
              decomposition at each level by requiring that the lower-level components are neces-
              sary and sufficient to the completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables.


        The WBS document is the key item of the create WBS process, but there are some other out-
        put items as well.


     Output of Creating WBS
        The output of the create WBS process consists of the items discussed in the following list.
        Work breakdown structure. The project manager creates this document with the help of the
        project team. Following are some important characteristics of the WBS:
             Each component in the WBS hierarchy, including work packages, is assigned a
             unique identifier called a code of account identifier. These identifiers can then be used
             in estimating costs, scheduling, and assigning resources.
             The WBS embraces the full scope of the project. If a task is not included in the
             WBS, it will not be done as a part of the project.
             Because the project manager creates the WBS with the help of the project team, it is
             also the beginning of the team-building process on the part of the project manager.
CREATING A WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS)                                       Chapter 3          63


      The WBS decomposes the project work into manageable pieces (work packages)
      that can be assigned to individuals. This helps define the responsibilities for the
      team members and is the starting point for building the schedule.
      Throughout the project, the WBS works as a reference for communication regarding
      what is included in the project and what is not.
 WBS dictionary. This is a supporting document for the main WBS document to provide
 details about the components of the WBS. The details about a component might include a code
 of account identifier, a statement of work, a list of milestones schedule, and the organization
 responsible for this component.
 Updates. During the create WBS process, the project team might realize that something out
 of the existing scope must be included in order to accomplish something in the scope. This
 will give rise to a change request, which might also come from other stakeholders during or
 after the first creation of the WBS. After the change request has been approved, not only the
 WBS will be changed--the scope statement must also be updated accordingly. The impact of
 the approved change request on the project scope management plan must be evaluated, and
 the plan must be updated accordingly.
 Scope baseline. This is not a different item in itself. The scope statement, the WBS docu-
 ment, and the WBS dictionary combined constitute the scope baseline against which all the
 change requests will be evaluated.


             NOTE
       Do not confuse the WBS with other information breakdown structures, such as the
       organizational breakdown structure (OBS), which provides a hierarchy of the perform-
       ing organization and can be used to identify organizational units for assigning the
       WBS work packages. Remember, the end goal of the WBS is to specify the project
       scope in terms of work packages; this is what distinguishes the WBS from other infor-
       mation breakdown structures.


 You might wonder who creates the WBS. Well, it is your responsibility, and you perform it with
 the help of the team. Which team? The work packages do not exist before the WBS is com-
 plete; therefore, no assignments have been made yet. Yes, you are right--depending upon the
 project, the final project team might not even exist yet. However, recall that one of the com-
 ponents of the project scope statement identifies the initial team members and the stakehold-
 ers. This is the team you will use to create the WBS.

     Before and After the WBS
       From the initiating process group until now, I have discussed quite a few documents created in
       various processes. Some of these documents become input into another process that creates some
       other document. It is important to understand the order in which these documents are created
       and which document is an input to creating which other document. This is shown in Figure 3.6.




           FIGURE 3.6 A number of documents are created during the initiation and scope planning processes.
                          An arrow shows the documents that are input to creating other documents, and the

       Table 3.1 presents some items that are input to processes. Note that organizational process
       assets are input into all the listed processes, approved changes are input into all the scope-related

The WBS is at the heart of project management. It affects directly or indirectly almost all the
processes that are performed after its creation. Figure 3.7 shows some of the processes that are
based on the WBS.




    FIGURE 3.7 Some processes based on the WBS

The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
     The scope management plan is the part of the project management plan that speci-
        fies how to define, control, and verify the project scope.
     The scope management plan, along with the project charter and the preliminary
     project scope statement from the initiation stage, becomes the input to developing
     the detailed project scope statement, which is a document that states what needs to
     be accomplished by the project.
     The project scope statement is an input item to create the work breakdown
     structure (WBS), which is a breakdown of project deliverables into manageable
     pieces called work packages. The WBS is supported by another document called
     the WBS dictionary, which offers details for the WBS components.
66    Chapter 3     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCOPE



     Summary
       After a project has been initiated, the project management plan is developed to specify how
       the project at hand will be planned, executed, controlled, and closed. The project management
       plan can contain subsidiary plans, such as a quality management plan, a risk management plan,
       and a project scope management plan. The scope management plan specifies how to define,
       control, and verify the scope. The scope management plan, along with the project charter and
       the preliminary project scope statement from the initiation stage, becomes the input to devel-
       oping the detailed project scope statement, also referred to as the scope statement.
       The project scope statement is a document that defines the scope of a project by stating what
       needs to be accomplished by the project. It includes project objectives, deliverables, a product
       description, and requirements. The project scope statement is an input item to creating the
       work breakdown structure (WBS), which is a breakdown of project deliverables into manage-
       able pieces called work packages, which in turn are used to develop the project schedule. The
       WBS is supported by another document called the WBS dictionary, which offers details for the
       WBS components.
       The scope statement, the WBS document, and the WBS dictionary combined constitute the
       scope baseline against which all change requests are evaluated. One advantage of project plan-
       ning is that it identifies and addresses uncertainties in the project. The uncertainties are bad
       because they are a source of risks. Risk management planning, along with quality planning, is
       discussed in the next chapter.


       Exam's Eye View
        Comprehend

         The project charter and the preliminary project scope statement are input items to the scope
            definition process that is used to develop the detailed project scope statement.

         The detailed project scope statement is an input item to creating the WBS.
         The scope statement, the WBS document, and the WBS dictionary combined constitute the
            scope baseline against which all change requests are evaluated.

        Look Out

         Do not confuse project scope with product scope. The product scope consists of the features
            and functions that characterize a product, service, or result to be delivered by the project,
            whereas the project scope is composed of the work that must be performed (and only that
            work) to deliver products, services, or results with specified features.

         The project scope management plan is an input item to both the scope definition and the WBS
            creation processes, but these processes can also update the project scope management plan.
                                                               KEY TERMS                  Chapter 3      67


   Memorize

    The project scope statement includes these elements: project objectives, project deliverables,
       project requirements, product description, assumptions and constraints, cost estimates, sched-
       uled milestones, initial risk identification, and the initial project team.

    Quality, resources, scope, and time are the common constraints you should consider across all
       projects.

    The success criteria stated in the scope statement of a project must be measurable, such as a
       three-percent increase in revenue, not vague, such as a substantial increase in revenue.

    The project scope management plan is a part of the project management plan.



Key Terms
       alternatives identification. A technique used to apply nonstandard approaches, such
          as brainstorming and lateral thinking, to perform project work.
          baseline. A reference plan for components, such as schedule, scope, and cost, against
          which performance deviations are measured. The reference plan can be the original

          gather ideas as candidates for a solution to a problem or an issue without any imme-
          diate evaluation of these ideas. The evaluation and analysis of these ideas happens
          later.
          configuration management. Refers to controlling the characteristics of a product, a
          service, or a result of a project. It includes documenting the features of a product or
          a service, controlling and documenting changes to the features, and providing sup-
          port for auditing the products for conformance to requirements.
          decomposition. A planning technique to subdivide the project scope, including
          deliverables, into smaller, manageable tasks called work packages.
          deliverable. A unique and verifiable product, a capability to provide a service, or a result
          that must be produced to complete a project or a process or phase of the project.
          lateral thinking. Thinking outside the box, beyond the realm of your experience, to
          search for new solutions and methods, rather than only better uses of the current
          solutions and methods.
          product scope. Features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result
          to be delivered by the project.

Introduction
  Quality and risk are two important interrelated aspects of any project that need to be man-
  aged. While quality refers to the degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables
  and objectives fulfill the project requirements, risk refers to an uncertain event or condition that,
  if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives. After you have
  planned the project scope to the WBS level, as discussed in the previous chapter, you are ready
  to plan the quality and risk management. After the project starts executing, you will not have
  enough time to plan a response to a risk if it occurs, so you need to plan risk responses before
  the project starts executing. To do that, you need to identify the risks and analyze them.
  The core question in this chapter is: How do you plan for quality and risk management? In
  search of an answer, we will explore three avenues: planning quality, identifying and analyzing
  risks, and planning risk responses.



Managing Quality
  Quality refers to the degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables and objec-
  tives fulfills the project requirements. In other words, it is the sum of project and product char-
  acteristics that help fulfill the requirements. The broader goal of quality management is to
  ensure that a given project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. Quality man-
  agement has two components: project quality management and product quality management.
  Whereas product quality management techniques depend upon the specific product that the
  project is going to produce, project quality management applies to all projects independent of
  the nature of the products. The performing organization might have its own quality policy and
  procedures in addition to the three quality management processes shown in Figure 4.1 and
  explained in the following list.
       Quality planning. This process is used to identify which quality standards are rele-
       vant to the project at hand and to determine how to meet these standards.
       Perform quality assurance. This process is used to apply the planned systematic
       quality activities to ensure that the project employs all the planned processes needed
       to meet all the project requirements.
       Quality control. This process monitors the project results to ensure that they meet
       the agreed-upon quality standards and identifies ways to eliminate the factors that
       keep the project results from meeting standards.
  The quality assurance and quality control processes are used during the project execution and
  control stages and are therefore discussed in Chapters 6 and 7, respectively. The quality plan-
  ning process is used during the project planning stage and is discussed next.
                                                PLANNING QUALITY                      Chapter 4           73




      FIGURE 4.1 Processes used in quality management



Planning Quality
  According to PMBOK, quality is defined as the degree to which a set of characteristics of pro-
  ject deliverables and objectives fulfill the project requirements. Therefore, any characteristic that
  influences the satisfaction of the stakeholders is included in determining the quality. The pro-
  ject quality management processes include performing quality planning, quality assurance, and
  quality control. Quality planning is the quality process that is performed during the planning
  phase to accomplish the following goals.
       Identify which quality standards are relevant to the project at hand
       Determine how to satisfy these standards
  Figure 4.2 depicts the quality planning process.
  The project scope statement is the key input to the quality planning process, in addition to
  other input items discussed next.




      FIGURE 4.2 Quality planning: input, tools and techniques, and output
74     Chapter 4      PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


     Input to Quality Planning
         This section details the items that can be used as input into the quality planning process.
         Enterprise environment factors. Guidelines, regulations from a government agency, rules, and
         standards relevant to the project at hand are examples of enterprise environment factors that
         must be considered during quality planning.
         Organizational process assets. The following organizational process assets can affect the pro-
         ject from the perspective of quality planning:
              Information from the previous projects and lessons learned
              An organizational quality policy, which is composed of overall intentions and high-
              level direction of an organization with respect to quality, established by the manage-
              ment at executive level
              Procedures relevant to the application area of this project
         If the performing organization lacks a quality policy, the project team will need to develop a
         quality policy for the project. Once a quality policy is in place, it is your responsibility to ensure
         that the project stakeholders are aware of it and are on the same page.
         Project management plan. The project management plan includes which processes will be
         implemented and to what level. It also includes which tools and techniques will be used to
         implement these processes. This information provides useful input to quality planning.
         Project scope statement. The project scope statement is the major input into quality plan-
         ning. Before you can plan quality, you need to understand what quality means for this project.
         Therefore, the following components of the project scope statement are especially relevant to
         quality planning:
              Project deliverables.
              Project objectives.
              Project requirements.
              A product scope description that may contain the details of technical issues and
              other quality-related concerns.
              Product acceptance criteria. The definition of acceptance criteria has an impact on
              the quality cost.
         With the input items in place, you use some tools and techniques to perform quality planning,
         as discussed in the following section.
                                                PLANNING QUALITY                     Chapter 4           75


Tools and Techniques Used for Quality Planning
   The tools and techniques used for quality planning include benchmarking, cost/benefit analy-
   sis, experiment design, and brainstorming.
   Benchmarking. Benchmarking is comparing practices, products, or services of a project with
   those of some reference projects for the purpose of learning, improving, and creating the basis
   for measuring performance. These reference projects might be the previous projects performed
   inside or outside of the performing organization. Improvement and performance are of course
   quality-related factors. For example, you might have a similar project performed in the past that
   accepted no more than two defects in each feature. You might use that as a quality criterion--
   a benchmark--for your project.
   Cost of quality and cost/benefit analysis. The cost of quality is the total cost incurred in imple-
   menting conformance to the requirements, reworking due to the defects resulting from failure
   to meet the requirements, and updating the product or service to meet the requirements. Dur-
   ing quality planning, you must consider the tradeoff between the cost and the benefit of qual-
   ity and strike the appropriate balance for a given project. Implementing quality has its costs,
   including quality management and fulfilling quality requirements. The benefits of meeting
   quality requirements include less rework, resulting in overall higher productivity; lower costs
   of maintaining the product or service; and higher customer satisfaction.
   Experiment design. This is a statistical method that can be used to identify the factors that
   might influence a set of specific variables for a product or a process under development or in
   production. By using the results from these experiments, you can optimize the products and
   processes.
   Other quality planning tools. Other tools that you can use in quality planning, depending
   upon the project, include brainstorming and flowcharting.
   You can use one or more of these techniques to generate the output of quality planning.


Output of Quality Planning
   A major output of the quality planning process is the quality management plan. This section
   discusses the quality management plan and other output items.
   Quality management plan. The quality management plan describes how the quality policy for
   this project will be implemented by the project management team. It also addresses quality
   assurance and quality control, as explained in the previous section. This plan becomes a com-
   ponent of the overall project management plan.



                TIP
         Whether the quality management plan is informal and high-level or formal and
         detailed depends upon the size, complexity, and needs of the project.
76    Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


       Quality metrics. This is an operational criterion that defines in specific terms what something
       (such as a characteristic or a feature) is and how the quality control process measures it. For
       example, it is not specific enough to say the defects in the product will be minimized. Rather,
       specifying something such as that no feature will have more than two defects is a measurable
       criterion and hence a metric. The metrics that you set during quality planning will be used in
       quality assurance and quality control.
       Quality checklist. A checklist is a structured tool used to verify that a predetermined set of
       required steps has been performed. The checklists can come in imperative form ("to do" lists)
       or in interrogative form ("have you done this" lists). Checklists are prepared (or identified if
       they already exist in the organization) in quality planning and used in quality control.
       Process improvement plan. This plan describes how to improve some of the processes that will
       be used in the project. For example, one purpose of improvement is to prevent activities in the
       processes which are not needed for this project. This is accomplished by describing the pur-
       pose, start, and end of a given process, the input to the process, and the output of the process.
       Quality baseline. The quality baseline specifies the quality objectives for the project and
       thereby makes the basis for measuring and reporting the quality performance. This becomes a
       part of the performance measurement baseline for the project, which is an integrated plan for
       the project specifying some parameters for the performance measurements, such as scope,
       schedule, and cost. The performance of the project is measured against this baseline. For
       example, a project that is finished on time, with everything delivered in scope, and that stayed
       within its cost is a project with high performance.
       Project management plan updates. Although the project management plan is an input item
       to quality planning, quality planning updates the project management plan. The biggest update
       is that the quality management plan becomes part of the project management plan.
       Quality assurance is the process of ensuring that the quality plan is implemented. Because it is
       part of the execution process group, it is explored in Chapter 6, "Executing the Project." Qual-
       ity control is the process of monitoring the project results to ensure that they conform to the
       planned quality. This process is part of the control process group and therefore is explored in
       Chapter 7, "Monitoring and Controlling Projects."
       Note that quality planning might influence other planning processes. For example, imple-
       menting the identified quality standards will impact the cost and the schedule. Furthermore,
       the implementation of a quality characteristic might require a risk analysis of the problem that
       the quality characteristic addresses.



     Managing Risks
       To most of us, risk means danger--if it happens, it will result in negative, undesired conse-
       quences. However, according to PMI, risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,
       has a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives related to components such
       as schedule (time), cost, scope, or quality. For example, one of the obvious schedule objectives
                                                MANAGING RISKS                    Chapter 4           77


for a project is to complete the project by the scheduled deadline. If a risk related to the sched-
ule occurs, it can delay the completion of the project, or it can make it possible to finish the
project earlier. The two characteristics of a risk in project management are the following:
     It stems from the elements of uncertainty.
     It might have negative or positive effects on meeting the project objectives.
The process of risk management includes planning risk management, identifying and analyz-
ing the risks, preparing the response plan, monitoring the risk, and implementing the risk
response if the risk occurs. Figure 4.3 shows the corresponding processes used to accomplish
these tasks, which are also explained in the following list:
     Risk management planning. Used to determine the how of the risk management--
        how to plan and execute the risk management activities for the given project.
        Risk identification. Used to identify and document the risks that might occur for a
        given project.
        Qualitative risk analysis. Used to estimate the overall probability for risks to occur
        and their impact, and to prioritize them accordingly for further analysis.
        Quantitative risk analysis. Used to analyze numerically the effect of identified risks
        on meeting the project objectives.
        Risk response planning. Used to prepare a risk response plan to increase the positive
        impact and decrease the negative impact of each identified risk.
        Risk monitoring and control. Used to track identified risks, identify new risks, exe-
        cute risk response plans, and evaluate the effectiveness of executing response
        throughout the lifecycle of the project.


             TIP
      The data flow between the different processes shown in Figure 4.3 is true in general.
      However, note that depending upon the project and the experience of the risk man-
      agement team, shortcuts can be taken. For example, you can go directly from risk
      identification to quantitative risk analysis, or even to risk response planning.




    FIGURE 4.3 Processes used in risk management
78     Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


        The risk monitoring and control process is part of the control process group; therefore, we will
        discuss this process in Chapter 7. The other five processes are discussed in the following sec-
        tions, starting with risk management planning.



     Planning Risk Management
        Risk management planning is the process used to decide how the risk management activities
        for the project at hand will be performed. The major goals for planning the risk management
        are threefold: Ensure that the type, level, and visibility of risk management are proportionate
        with the actual risk involved in the project and the importance of the project to the organiza-
        tion; secure sufficient resources, including time for risk management activities; and set up an
        agreed-upon basis for evaluating risks. To be specific, you use the risk management planning
        process to determine the following:
             How to approach the risk management activities for this project
             How to plan the risk management activities
             How to execute the risk management activities
        Figure 4.4 shows the risk management planning process.
        The input to risk management planning is identical to that of quality planning.




            FIGURE 4.4 The risk management planning process: input, tools and techniques, and output


     Input to Risk Management Planning
        As Figures 4.2 and 4.4 suggest, the lists of input items to quality planning and risk manage-
        ment planning are identical. The enterprise environment factors include the organizational
        attitude toward risks and the risk tolerance level of the organization. This information can be
        found from the policy statements of the organization and from actual experience with previ-
        ous projects.
                              PLANNING RISK MANAGEMENT                            Chapter 4          79


   The organization process assets include organizational approaches toward risk management,
   definitions of concepts and terms used within the organization, standard risk templates you can
   use, a roles and responsibilities list, and authority levels for decision-making.
   The project scope statement contains elements, such as the following, that are relevant to risk
   management planning:
        Assumptions and constraints. Assumptions should be evaluated for their uncer-
        tainty and thereby the possible risks. Constraints represent fixed parameters, such as
        available funds and deadlines that can also pose risks to the project.
        Project objectives and requirements. You must address the risks that might prevent
        the team from meeting the project objectives and requirements.
        Product description. There might be risks involved in performing the work for
        meeting the product description.
        Initial risk identification. The project scope statement might contain some of the
        risks you initially identified. Now you have more information to build on that work.
   The project management plan might have some information on which risk-related processes
   to use for this project. With these input items in place, the main technique used for risk man-
   agement planning is meeting.


Tools and Techniques for Risk Management Planning
   You develop the risk management plan by holding planning meetings, which might include the
   following attendees:
           Project manager
           Selected members from the project team
           Selected stakeholders
           Any member from the performing organization who has the responsibility for risk
           planning and executing
   In these meetings, the input items are used to develop the risk management plan, the only out-
   put of the risk management planning process.


Output of Risk Management Planning
   The only output of risk management planning is the risk management plan, which includes
   the following elements.
   Methodology. This specifies the system of approaches, tools, and data sources that will be
   used to perform risk management on the project at hand. These tools and approaches might
   vary over the projects, so you have to make the best selection for the given project.
80   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


      Identifying and assigning resources. This identifies and assigns the resources for risk man-
      agement, such as human resources, cost, and time.
           Roles and responsibilities. This specifies the roles and responsibilities for each role
           involved in risk management. These roles are assigned to the members of the risk
           management team. The risk management team might include members from outside
           the project team.
           Budgeting. The cost for risk management activities needs to be estimated and
           included in the budget and the project cost baseline.
           Timing and scheduling. The plan specifies how often the risk management
           processes will be performed and which risk management activities will be included
           in the project schedule, which is planned and developed by using processes discussed
           in Chapter 5, "Planning the Project Schedule."



                   TIP
            It's a good idea for the risk management team to include members from outside the
            project team to ensure unbiased risk evaluations.


      Risk categories. This element specifies how the risks will be categorized. The risk categories
      typically correspond to the sources of risks. Depending upon the size and complexity of the
      project, you might need to develop a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical
      structure that breaks the identified risk categories into subcategories. In developing this struc-
      ture, you will end up identifying various areas and causes of potential risks. The performing
      organization might already have prepared a categorization of typical risks. However, you need
      to examine this categorization for each project and tailor it according to the needs of the pro-
      ject at hand. The risk categorization helps you identify the risks to the extent that you will be
      identifying various areas and causes of potential risks for your project.



                   TIP
            Some project management literature and some PMP exam questions might use the
            terms "risk sources" and "risk categories" synonymously.



      Risk probability and impact. Defining different levels of risk probabilities and impacts is nec-
      essary to ensure the quality and credibility of the qualitative risk analysis that we will discuss
      later in this chapter. The basic issues are defining the scale of likelihood that the risk will hap-
      pen and defining the scale of the strength of its impact if the risk occurs. These definitions,
      even if they already exist in the organization, must be examined and tailored to the needs of
      the specific project.
                              PLANNING RISK MANAGEMENT                             Chapter 4           81


You can define the risk probability scale from very unlikely to almost certainly, called the rel-
ative scale. As an alternative, you can define a numerical scale in which the probability is rep-
resented by numbers, in which a value close to 0.0 means very unlikely and a value close to 1.0
means almost certainly. The impact scale represents the size of the risk impact on the given
project objective should the risk occur. Just like the probability scale, you can define the impact
scale relatively or numerically. The relative scale can range from very low impact to very high
impact, with points in the middle such as low, moderate, and high. As an alternative, you can
define the impact numerically; it might be linear, such as the first point at 0.1, the second
point at 0.2, and the tenth point at 1.0, or it might be nonlinear, such as the first point at
0.001, the second point at 0.01, and the third point at 0.1. Figure 4.5 shows an example of lin-
ear and nonlinear impact scales, in which the impact scale for objective 1 is nonlinear and the
impact scale for objective 2 is linear. You can think of the X axis as a variable on which the risk
impact depends.
Risks are prioritized according to the size of their impact on the project objectives, which can
be recorded in what is called an impact matrix or lookup table. Even if your organization
already has a typical impact matrix, you should examine it and tailor it to the needs of the spe-
cific project at hand. I will discuss the probability and impact matrix in more detail later in
this chapter.




    FIGURE 4.5 An example of a linear and a nonlinear impact scale. The impact scale for objective 1
                   is nonlinear, whereas the scale for objective 2 is linear.
82   Chapter 4      PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


      As an example, Table 4.1 shows the risk impact definitions for four project objectives: cost,
      quality, scope, and time. Note that this example only shows the negative impact. The first row
      of the table presents the impact scale, and each cell in the following rows from column 2 to
      column 6 specifies the impact on a specific objective corresponding to a point on the overall
      impact scale. For example, the cell corresponding to the first row and fifth column reads that
      high impact (0.65) means a 50 to 80% increase in cost.

      Risk reporting and tracking. This element describes the format of the risk reports, such as the
      risk register, a document that contains the results of risk analysis and risk response planning.
      Furthermore, it describes how different aspects of risk activities will be recorded so that the
      risks can be monitored for the current project. Also, should the performing organization
      decide to audit the risk management process, one should be able to track these activities.
      Another reason for recording these activities could be to save the information for the benefit
      of future projects in the form of lessons learned.
      During the process of planning risk management for a specific project, you revisit the toler-
      ance levels of the stakeholders for certain risks, and these levels may be revised. Risk manage-
      ment planning is the process that generates the risk management plan document, which
      contains the information that will be used in risk identification, risk analysis, and risk response
      planning.

Identifying Risks
    Risks are identified by using the risk identification process. An unidentified risk is a danger
    lurking out of your sight and waiting to attack the project. The significance of the risk identi-
    fication process cannot be overemphasized. You use the risk identification process to accom-
    plish the following tasks:
         Identify which risks might affect the project at hand
         Document the characteristics of the identified risks in a document called the risk
            register
    Figure 4.6 shows the input, tools and techniques, and the output for the risk identification
    process.
    Note that the risk identification process has the risk management plan as an input item, in
    addition to all the input items that the quality planning and risk management planning
    processes have.




        FIGURE 4.6 The risk identification process: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input to Risk Identification
    The risk management plan, the project management plan, and the project scope statement are
    the key input items to the risk identification process. As in many other processes, the enter-
    prise environment factors and organizational process assets relevant to the project at hand
    must also be considered.
         Enterprise environment factors. The environmental factors internal or external to
            the performing organization that can influence the project must be considered in the
            risk identification process. This might include academic and industry studies, bench-
            marking, and commercial databases.
84     Chapter 4      PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


              Organizational process assets. This might include information from previous pro-
                 jects (the knowledge base), including lessons learned.
              Project scope statement. Assumptions in the project scope statement are potential
              sources of uncertainty, hence the risk. Constraints pose a risk by presenting predeter-
              mined factors, such as hard deadlines and fixed cost, thereby posing questions such
              as, what is the probability that we can meet this constraint with the available
              resources?
              Project management plan. Identification of risks requires information from other
              processes, which can be found in the project management plan. For example, you
              might need to know the information about cost, quality, and scope before you can
              identify a risk.
              Risk management plan. The key items from the risk management plan useful for
              risk identification are risk categories, roles and responsibilities, and the budget and
              timing available for the risk management activities.
         With this handful of input for your use, you are ready to use a number of tools and techniques
         available for risk identification.


     Tools and Techniques for Risk Identification
         Risk identification is crucial to risk management: If you fail to identify a risk, you will not be
         able to manage it. There are a multitude of tools and techniques available to aid you in iden-
         tifying risks.
         Assumptions analysis. Assumptions in the project scope statement represent uncertainty. You
         analyze these assumptions to identify the risks. Assumptions analysis is the technique used to
         examine the validity of the assumptions and thereby to identify the risks resulting from the
         inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or incompleteness of each assumption. For example, assume that
         there is only one person in the organization who has a rare skill needed for the project. An obvi-
         ous assumption would be that the person will not quit the organization before completing the
         assignment. The inaccuracy of this assumption amounts to the risk.
         Checklist analysis. The carefully prepared checklists in any process are great no-brainer time-
         savers. The projects in the same organization will more often than not have similarities. As a
         result, you can develop a risk identification checklist based on the information gathered from
         a similar set of projects previously performed. Also, if you developed the risk breakdown struc-
         ture (RBS) in risk planning, the lowest level of RBS can be used as a checklist.


                      NOTE
               Risk identification checklists are rarely exhaustive. Always explore what is left out of
               the checklist you are using. Also, improve the checklist when you close the project to
               enhance its value for future projects.
                                            IDENTIFYING RISKS                    Chapter 4          85


Diagramming techniques. These techniques use diagrams to identify risks by exposing and
exploring the risks' causes. Here are a few examples:
     Cause-and-effect diagram. A cause-and-effect diagram illustrates how various fac-
     tors (causes) can be linked to potential problems (effects).
     Flowchart diagram. A flowchart depicts how the elements of a system are related to
     each other and shows the logical flow of a process. By examining the flowchart of a
     process, the risk management team can identify the points of potential problems in
     the flowchart diagram.
     Influence diagram. An influence diagram is a graphical representation of situations
     that shows relationships among various variables and outcomes, such as causal influ-
     ences and time-ordering of events. By examining these diagrams, the risk manage-
     ment team can recognize the potential problem areas and thereby identify risks.
Documentation reviews. A structured review of the relevant parts of input documents, such
as the project scope statement and the project management plan, will certainly help in identi-
fying risks. Furthermore, the knowledge base related to risk management from the previous
projects can also be reviewed.
Information-gathering techniques. To identify risks, you need to gather risk-related informa-
tion. Following are some of the information-gathering techniques used in risk identification:
     Brainstorming. The goal here is to get a comprehensive list of potential risks so that
        no risk goes unidentified. The project team, along with the relevant experts from dif-
        ferent disciplines, can participate in the brainstorming session. Brainstorming is bet-
        ter performed under the guidance of a facilitator. You can use the categories of risks
        or the RBS as a framework to keep the session focused on the issue.
     Delphi technique. The goal here is for the experts to reach a consensus without
        biases toward each other. I'm sure you will have no problem recalling a time when a
        decision was made because somebody (usually higher in the management hierarchy)
        said so. Contrary to this, the Delphi technique is used to ensure that it is the quality
        of the information and the argument that are important, not who is saying them. A
        facilitator circulates a questionnaire among the experts to solicit ideas about the risks
        of the given project. The experts respond anonymously. The responses are compiled
        and circulated among the participating experts for further evaluation without attach-
        ing a name to a response. It might take a few iterations before a general consensus is
        reached.
     Interviewing. This is one of the common methods used for information-gathering
     for risk identification. You interview the appropriate stakeholders and subject matter
     experts to gather information that will help identify risks for the project at hand.
     Root cause identification. A powerful way to identify risk is to look for anything in
     the project that might generate a risk. In other words, if you can spot a potential
     cause for risks, it's simple to identify the risks resulting from that cause. Further-
     more, if you know the cause of a risk, it helps to plan an effective response. You can
     also look for risks at the opposite side of causes--that is, impacts.
86     Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


             SWOT analysis. While root cause identification techniques look into the causes of
                the risks to identify the risks, a SWOT analysis looks at the potential impacts of the
                risks to identify the risks. If you examine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
                and threats (SWOT) of a given project, you will be exposing the risks involved.
                Remember that a strength is an opportunity, a weakness is a threat, and opportuni-
                ties and threats are posed by risks. This helps broaden the spectrum of risks consid-
                ered. For example, a strength of your project might be that most of its parts are well
                understood from previously executed similar projects. Therefore, the risks involved in
                those parts will be easy to identify. A weakness of your project might be that one of
                the parts involves new technology that is not well-tested. So, this is a source of
                unknown risks. An opportunity might be that your organization will be the first one
                to take this product to the market. An example of a threat might be that the govern-
                ment is considering a bill that, if it becomes a law, will have profound implications
                for your project.
        You will generally be using more than one of these tools and techniques to identify the risks.
        During risk identification, you might discover the causes of the risks, and you might even think
        of some potential risk responses. All this is part of the output of the risk identification process.


     The Risk Register: The Output of Risk Identification
        The risk register is a document that contains the output of the risk identification process. You
        will see later in this chapter that the risk register, which is initiated in the risk identification
        process, will also contain the information from other risk management processes. To begin,
        you store the following information from the risk identification process in the risk register:
             List of identified risks. These are the risks that you identified in the risk identifica-
                tion process.
             List of the root causes of the risks. This is a list of events or conditions that might
             give rise to the identified risks.
             Updated risk categories. Risks categories were originally identified in the risk man-
             agement planning process. However, in the process of identifying risks you might
             discover new categories or modify the existing categories. The updated risk cate-
             gories must be included in the risk register.
             List of potential responses. Risk response planning is a separate process that is per-
             formed after risk analysis. However, during risk identification, you might identify
             potential risk responses that you must document in the risk register. These responses
             can be further examined and planned in the risk response planning process.
        The risk register becomes part of the project management plan.
        The results of the risk identification process usually lead to the qualitative risk analysis. How-
        ever, depending upon the project and the experience of the risk management team, risk iden-
        tification might lead directly to the quantitative risk analysis and even to risk response planning.
                                                    ANALYZING RISKS                     Chapter 4         87


Analyzing Risks
    Once the risks have been identified, you need to answer two main questions for each identi-
    fied risk: What are the odds that the risk will occur and, if it does, what will its impact be on
    the project objectives? You get the answers by performing risk analysis, which comes in two
    forms: qualitative and quantitative.
         Qualitative risk analysis. This is used to prioritize risks by estimating the probabil-
         ity of their occurrence and their impact on the project.
         Quantitative risk analysis. This is used to perform the numerical analysis to estimate
         the effect of each identified risk on the overall project objectives and deliverables.
    Usually, you prioritize the risks by performing qualitative analysis on them before you perform
    quantitative analysis.


Qualitative Analysis
    Because the qualitative analysis is an estimate, it is less precise than the quantitative analysis,
    which is based on numbers and hence is more precise. However, qualitative analysis is quicker
    and cheaper. It gives you some feel about the risks, and then you can determine which risks
    needs to be analyzed further by using the quantitative analysis.
    Figure 4.7 shows the input, tools and techniques, and output for the qualitative analysis, which
    are discussed in the following section.

      Input to Qualitative Risk Analysis
      In addition to the risk register, the qualitative risk analysis can also use the risk management
      plan, the project scope statement, and the organizational process assets as input items.
      Organizational process assets. While analyzing risks, you will make use of the risk-related
      components of the knowledge base from the previous projects, such as data about risks and
      lessons learned.
      Project scope statement. When you are performing qualitative risk analysis, you want to
      know what kinds of risks you are dealing with. For example, are you already familiar with these
      risks? If your project is similar to previous projects, it might have well-understood risks. If it is
      a new and complex project, it might involve risks that are not well-understood in your organi-
      zation. So, how do you know what kind of project are you dealing with? Simple--you take a
      look at the project scope statement.
      Risk management plan. To generate the output of the qualitative risk analysis, you will need
      the following elements of the risk management plan:
              Budgeting
              Definitions of probabilities and impacts
              The probability and impact matrices
              Risk categories
              Risk timing and scheduling
      If any of these input items was not developed during the risk management planning, it can be
      developed during the qualitative analysis.
      Risk register. The risk register contains the list of identified risks that will be the key input to
      the qualitative risk analysis. Updated risk categories and causes of risks can also be useful ele-
      ments of the risk register, which can be used in the qualitative risk analysis.


      Tools and Techniques for Qualitative Risk Analysis
      Prioritizing risks based on their probabilities of occurrence and their impact if they do occur is
      the central goal of the qualitative risk analysis. Accordingly, most of the tools and techniques
      used involve estimating probability and impact.
      Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability refers to the likelihood that a risk
      will occur, and impact refers to the effect the risk will have on a project objective if it occurs.
      The probability for each risk and the impact of each risk on project objectives, such as cost,
      quality, scope, and time, must be assessed. Note that probability and impacts are assessed for
      each identified risk.
      Methods used in making the probability and impact assessment include holding meetings, inter-
      viewing, considering expert judgment, and using an information base from previous projects. A
      risk with a high probability might have a very low impact, and a risk with a low probability might
      have a very high impact. To prioritize the risks, you need to look at both probability and impact.
                                                ANALYZING RISKS                     Chapter 4           89


Probability and impact matrix. Risks need to be prioritized for the quantitative analysis,
response planning, or both. The prioritization can be performed by using the probability and
impact matrix--a lookup table that can be used to rate a risk based on where it falls both on
the probability scale and on the impact scale. Table 4.2 presents an example of a probability
and impact matrix by showing both the probability scale and the impact scale. Here is an exam-
ple of how to read this matrix: risk R45 has a probability of 0.70 (that is, seven out of 10 chances)
for occurrence and an impact of 0.45 on the project objective for which this matrix is prepared.
How to calculate the numerical scales for the probability and impact matrix and what
they mean depends upon the project and the organization. However, remember the relative
meaning: Higher value of a risk on the probability scale means greater likelihood of risk occur-
rence, and higher value on the impact scale means greater effect on the project objectives. The
higher the value for a risk, the higher its priority is. For example, risk R38 has higher priority
than risk R27.

 *Rij, where i and j are integers, represent risks in the two-dimensional (probability and impact)
 space.


Each risk is rated (prioritized) according to the probability and the impact value assigned to it
separately for each objective. Generally, you can divide the matrix in Table 4.2 into three areas--
high-priority risks represented by higher numbers, such as R59; medium-priority risks repre-
sented by moderate numbers, such as R23; and low-priority risks represented by lower numbers,
such as R12. However, each organization has to design its own risk score and risk threshold to
guide the risk response plan.
Note that impact can be a threat (a negative effect) or an opportunity (a positive effect). You
will have separate matrices for threats and opportunities. Threats in the high-priority area
might require priority actions and aggressive responses. Also, you will want to capitalize on
those opportunities in the high-priority area, which you can do with relatively little effort. Risks
posing threats in the low-priority area might not need any response, but they must be kept on
the watch list.
90   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


      Assessment of the risk data quality. Qualitative risk analysis is performed to analyze the risk
      data to prioritize risks. However, before you do it, you must examine the risk data for its qual-
      ity, which is crucial because the credibility of the results of qualitative risk analysis depends
      upon the quality of the risk data. If the quality of the risk data is found to be unacceptable, you
      might decide to gather better-quality data. The technique to assess the risk data quality involves
      examining the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data, and also examining how good that
      data is relevant to the specific risk and project for which it is being used.
      Risk categorization. You defined the risk categories during risk management planning and the
      risk identification processes. Now you can assign the identified risks to those categories. You
      can also revisit the categorization scheme, such as RBS, that you developed for your project,
      because now you have more information about risks for the project. Categorizing risks by their
      causes often helps you develop effective risk responses.
      Risk urgency assessment. This is a risk prioritization technique based on time urgency. For
      example, a risk that is going to occur now is more urgent to address than a risk that might occur
      a month from now.
      You need to update the risk register with the output of the qualitative risk analysis.


      Output of the Qualitative Risk Analysis:
      Updated Risk Register
      The risk register was initiated during the risk identification process and is updated with the
      results from the qualitative risk analysis. The updates include the following:
           Risk categorizations. This means arranging risks in different categories. This helps
              you identify the causes of the risks and the areas of the project that might require
              special attention. Furthermore, categorizing risks can bring order to a chaotic situa-
              tion and makes the management of these risks easier and more effective.
           Prioritized list of risks. The risk register has lists of risks prioritized according to
              the probability and impact matrix discussed earlier in this chapter. A separate list can
              be created for each project objective, such as cost, quality, scope, and time. These
              lists help you prioritize efforts for preparing and executing risk responses.
              List of risks with time urgency. This list includes urgent risks that require attention
              now or in the near future.
              Watch list of low-priority lists. This list contains the risks that are deemed unim-
              portant by the qualitative risk analysis, but that need to be monitored continually.
              List of risks for additional analysis and response. This list includes risks that need
              further analysis, such as quantitative analysis or a response action.
              Trends in the analysis results. By examining the results from the qualitative risk
              analysis, you might recognize a trend for specific risks. That trend might suggest fur-
              ther analysis or a specific risk response.
                                                    ANALYZING RISKS                     Chapter 4            91


   The main output of qualitative risk analysis is the prioritization of risks based on a probabil-
   ity and impact matrix for each objective. So each objective can have its own prioritized list of
   risks.
   Qualitative risk analysis is a relatively quick and cost-effective way to prioritize risks for risk
   planning. It also does the groundwork for the quantitative risk analysis if one is required for
   some risks.


Quantitative Analysis
   Qualitative risk analysis is generally performed on the risks that have been prioritized by using
   the qualitative risk analysis. However, depending upon the experience of the team and their
   familiarity with the risk, it is possible to skip the qualitative risk analysis and move directly after
   the risk identification to the quantitative risk analysis. The quantitative risk analysis has three
   major goals:
        Assess the probabilities of achieving specific project objectives
        Quantify the effect of the risks on the overall project objectives
        Prioritize risks by their contributions to the overall project risk
   Figure 4.8 shows the quantitative risk analysis process in terms of input, tools and techniques,
   and output.




       FIGURE 4.8 The quantitative risk analysis process: input, tools and techniques, and output
92   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


      Input to Quantitative Analysis
      All the items that are input for the qualitative risk analysis are also input for the quantitative
      risk analysis. Because the quantitative risk analysis generally requires more information, it also
      includes project management plans in its list of input items, which are discussed in the fol-
      lowing list.
           Organization process assets. The following organizational process assets might be
              useful in the quantitative analysis:
               Information on previously performed similar projects
               Studies performed by risk specialists on similar projects
               Proprietary risk databases or risk databases available from the industry
           Project scope statement. The project scope statement is especially important if the
           risk comes to the quantitative analysis directly after the identification. When you are
           performing risk analysis, you want to know what kind of risks you are dealing with.
           For example, are you already familiar with these risks? If your project is similar to
           the previous projects, it might have well-understood risks. If it is a new and complex
           project, it might involve risks that are not well-understood in your organization. So
           how do you know what kind of project are you dealing with? You take a look at the
           project scope statement.
           Risk management plan. To generate the output of the quantitative risk analysis, you
           need the following elements of the risk management plan:
            Budgeting
            Definitions of probabilities and impacts
            Probability and impact matrix
               Risk categories
               Risk timing and scheduling
           Risk register. The key input items from the risk register are the following:
            List of identified risks
            Priority list of risks if the qualitative risk analysis was performed
            Risks with categories assigned to them
           Project management plan. To analyze the effect of risks on the project objectives,
              you need to know the project schedule and the project cost. These can be found in
              the project management plan.
      Obviously, the quantitative risk analysis will use techniques that are of a more numerical nature.
                                               ANALYZING RISKS                    Chapter 4           93


Tools and Techniques for Quantitative Analysis
The quantitative risk analysis can be looked upon as a two-step process--gathering and rep-
resenting the data, and analyzing and modeling the data. Accordingly, all the techniques fall
into two categories: data gathering and representation techniques, such as interviewing, prob-
ability distributions, and expert judgment; and analysis and modeling techniques, such as sen-
sitivity analysis, EMV analysis, decision tree analysis, and modeling and simulation.
Interviewing. This technique is used to collect the data for assessing the probabilities of achiev-
ing specific project objectives. You are looking for results such as: We have a 70% probability
of finishing the project within the schedule desired by the customer. Or perhaps: We have a
60% probability of finishing the project within the budget of $100,000. The goal is to deter-
mine the scale of probabilities for a given objective; for example, there is a 20% probability that
the project will cost $50,000, a 60% probability that it will cost $100,000, and a 20% proba-
bility that it will cost $150,000.
The data is collected by interviewing relevant stakeholders and subject matter experts. Most
commonly, you will be exploring the optimistic (best case), pessimistic (worst case), and most
likely scenarios for a given objective. For example, for the project cost, the optimistic estimate
might be $10 million, the pessimistic estimate might be $50 million, and the most likely esti-
mate might be $25 million.
Probability distributions. After you have collected the data on meeting the project objectives,
you can present it in a probability distribution for each objective under study. Note that a dis-
tribution represents uncertainty, and uncertainty represents risk. For example, if you know for
sure the project will cost $25 million, there will be no distribution because it is only one data
point. Distribution comes into the picture when you have several possible values with a prob-
ability assigned to each value. There are distributions of different shapes in which the data can
be presented. Figure 4.9 shows some of them, such as for the cost objective. The X axis repre-
sents the cost, and the Y axis represents the corresponding probability that the project will be
completed within that cost.
The beta distribution and the triangular distribution are the most frequently used distributions.
The other commonly used distributions that could be suitable under given circumstances are
normal distribution and uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is used when all the
values of an objective have the same chance of being true.
Sensitivity analysis. This is a technique used to determine which risk has the greatest impact
on the project. You study the impact of one uncertain element on a project objective by keep-
ing all other uncertain elements fixed at their baseline values. You can repeat this analysis for
several objectives, one at a time. You can also repeat this study for several uncertain elements
(creating risks), one element at a time. This way, you can see the impact of each element (or
risk) on the overall project separate from other elements (or risks).
94   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT




          FIGURE 4.9 Examples of probability distributions commonly used in the quantitative risk analysis

      Expected monetary value analysis. The expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is used to
      calculate the expected value of an outcome when different possible scenarios exist for different
      values of the outcome with some probabilities assigned to them. The goal here is to calculate
      the expected final result of a probabilistic situation. EMV is calculated by multiplying the
      value of each possible outcome by the probability of its occurrence and adding the results. For
      example, if there is 60% probability that an opportunity will earn you $1,000 and a 40% prob-
      ability that it will only earn you $500, the EMV is calculated as follows:
              EMV = 0.60 * 1000 + 0.40 * 500 = 600 + 200 = 800
      So the EMV in this case is $800. When you are using opportunities and threats in the same
      calculation, you should express EMV for an opportunity as positive value, and that for a threat
      as negative value. For example if there is a 60% chance that you will benefit from a risk by
      $1,000, and a 40% probability that you will lose $400 as a result of this risk, the EMV is cal-
      culated as follows:
              EMV = 0.60 * 1000 - 0.40 * 500 = 600 - 200 = 400
      Therefore, the EMV in this case is $400.

The concept of EMV can be presented in a decision-making technique, such as a decision tree
analysis.
Decision tree analysis. This technique uses the decision tree diagram to choose from differ-
ent available options; each option is represented by a branch of the tree. This technique is used
when there are multiple possible outcomes with different threats or opportunities with certain
probabilities assigned to them. EMV analysis is done along each branch, which helps to make
a decision about which option to choose.
Figure 4.10 presents a very simple decision tree diagram that depicts two options: updating an
existing product or building a new product from scratch. The initial cost for the update option
is $50,000, whereas the initial cost for the build-from-scratch option is $70,000. However, the
probability for failure is 40% for the update option, compared to 10% for the build-from-scratch
option, and the impact from failure in both cases is a loss of $200,000. As Table 4.3 shows,
even though the initial cost for the update option is less than the initial cost for the build-from-
scratch option, the decision will be made in favor of the build-from-scratch option because
when you combine the initial cost with the EMV resulting from the probability of failure, the
build-from-scratch option turns out to be a better deal.

      Modeling and simulation. A model is a set of rules to describe how something works; it takes
      input and makes predictions as output. The rules might include formulas and functions based
      on facts, assumptions, or both. A simulation is any analytical method used to imitate a real-life
      system. Simulations in risk analysis are created using the Monte Carlo technique, which is
      named after Monte Carlo, France--known for its casinos that present games of chance based
      on random behavior. Monte Carlo simulation models take random input iteratively to gener-
      ate output for certain quantities as predictions. This technique is used in several disciplines,
      such as physics and biology, in addition to project management. In risk analysis, the input is
      taken randomly from a probability distribution, and the output for impact on the project
      objectives is predicted. The name "Monte Carlo" refers to the random behavior of the input.
      (In that spirit, it could easily be called Las Vegas.)
      Expert judgment. In the quantitative risk analysis, expert judgment can be used to validate the
      collected risk data and the analysis used for the project at hand.
      The risk register is updated with the results of the quantitative risk analysis.

      Output of the Quantitative Risk Analysis:
      Updated Risk Register
      The risk register that was used as an input item to the quantitative risk analysis is updated
      with the results of this analysis. The updates include the following:
           Probabilistic analysis of the project. This includes the estimates of the project
              schedule and cost with a confidence level attached to each estimate. Confidence level
              is expressed in percentage form, such as 95%, and it represents how certain you are
              about the estimate. You can compare these estimates to the stakeholders' risk toler-
              ances to see whether the project is within the acceptable limits.
           Probability of achieving the project objectives. Factoring in the project risks, you
           can estimate the probabilities of meeting project objectives, such as cost and sched-
           ule set forth by the current project plan. For example, the likelihood of completing
           the project within the current budget plan of $2 million is 70%.
           Prioritized list of risks. The risks are prioritized according to the threats they pose or
           the opportunities they offer. The risks with greater threats (or opportunities) are
           higher on the list. The goal is to prioritize the response plan efforts to eliminate (or
           minimize) the impact of the threats and capitalize on the opportunities. The priorities
           are determined based on the total effect of each risk to the overall project objectives.
           Trends in the results. By repeating the analysis several times and by examining the
           results, you might recognize a trend for specific risks. That trend might suggest fur-
           ther analysis or a specific risk response.
      The emphasis in quantitative analysis is on two tasks: Assess the probabilities of meeting each
      project objective and prioritize the risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall
      project objectives. Subsequently, the resultant prioritized list of risks can be used to prepare the
      risk response plan.

Planning the Risk Response
   Depending on the project, the nature of risks, and the experience of the team, risk response
   planning can start after risk identification, qualitative risk analysis, or quantitative risk analy-
   sis. Recall that risks can include threats (negative risks) and opportunities (positive risks).
   Accordingly, the central task in risk response planning is to develop actions and options to meet
   the following two goals:
        Minimize threats to meeting project objectives
        Maximize opportunities
   As shown in Figure 4.11, the risk management plan and risk register are the input items to
   risk response planning.




       FIGURE 4.11 The risk response planning process: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input to Risk Response Planning
   The only two input items for risk response planning are the risk register and the risk manage-
   ment plan.
   Risk register. The risk register contains the results from the risk identification, qualitative risk
   analysis, and quantitative risk analysis. The following elements of the risk register are espe-
   cially useful for risk response planning:
           List of identified risks
           Root causes of risks
           Prioritized list of responses
           List of risks that need immediate attention
           Trends in analysis results
98     Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


        Risk management plan. The elements of the risk management plan that can be useful for risk
        response planning include the following:
             Organizations' and stakeholders' thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks to sort
             out those risks for which the response is needed.
             Roles and responsibilities that specify the positions and functions for each position
             involved in risk management. These roles are assigned to the members of the risk
             management team, which might include members from inside or outside the project
             team.
             Timing and a schedule that specify how often the risk management processes will be
             performed and which risk management activities will be included in the project
             schedule.
        Because there is a wide spectrum of risks that can occur, there are a multitude of tools and tech-
        niques available to plan responses for these risks.


     Tools and Techniques for Risk Response Planning
        Risk, as you have already learned, can come in two categories: negative risks, which pose threats
        to meeting the project objectives, and positive risks, which offer opportunities. The goal is to
        minimize the threats and maximize the opportunities. In project management, there are three
        kinds of possible responses to risks--take an action, take no action, or take a conditional action.
        When you want to take an action, different response strategies for negative and positive risks
        need to be planned. Accordingly, there are three kinds of strategies available to handle three
        kinds of scenarios:
             Strategies to respond to negative risks (threats) when action is required
             Strategies to respond to positive risks (opportunities) when action is required
             Strategies that can be used to respond to both negative and positive risks when no
                action or a conditional action is taken


        Response Strategies for Threats
        There are only three commonsense ways to take an action against a potential problem: Get out
        of harm's way, pass it to someone else, or confront it to minimize the damage. In project man-
        agement, these three strategies are called avoid, transfer, and mitigate--the ATM approach.
        Avoid. You avoid the risk by changing your project management plan in such a way that the
        risk is eliminated. Depending upon the situation, this can be accomplished in various ways,
        including the following:
             Obtaining information and clarifying requirements for risks based on misunder-
                standing or miscommunication. This answers two questions: Do we really have this
                risk and, if yes, how can we avoid it?
             Acquiring expertise for risks that exist due to a lack of expertise.
                           PLANNING THE RISK RESPONSE                             Chapter 4           99


     Isolating the project objectives from the risk whenever possible.
     Relaxing the objective that is under threat, such as extending the project schedule.
Transfer. Risk transfer means you shift the responsibility for responding to the risk (the own-
ership of the risk), the negative impact of the risk, or both to another party. Note that trans-
ferring the risk transfers the responsibility for risk management and does not necessarily
eliminate the risk. Risk transfer almost always involves making payment of a risk premium to
the party to which the risk has been transferred. Some examples include buying an insurance
policy and contracting out the tasks involving risk.
Mitigate. Mitigation in general means taking action to reduce or prevent the impact of a dis-
aster that is expected to occur. Risk mitigation means reducing the probability of risk occur-
rence, reducing the impact of the risk if it does occur, or both. A good mitigation strategy is to
take action early on to first reduce the probability of the risk happening, and then to plan for
reducing its impact if it does occur, rather than letting it occur and then trying to reduce the
impact or repair the damage. Following are some examples of mitigation:
        Adopting less complex processes
        Conducting more tests on the product or service of the project
        Choosing a more stable supplier for the project supplies
        Designing redundancy into a system so that if one part fails, the redundant part
        takes over and the system keeps working
Each of these three strategies has a counter-strategy to deal with the opportunities.


Response Strategies for Opportunities
Just like in the case of threats, you have three strategies to deal with opportunities. Not sur-
prisingly, each response strategy to deal with an opportunity is a counterpart of a response strat-
egy to deal with a threat--a one-to-one correspondence:
     Share corresponds to transfer
     Exploit corresponds to avoid
     Enhance corresponds to mitigate
You use the SEE (share, exploit, enhance) approach to dealing with the opportunities presented
by the positive risks.
Share. Sharing a positive risk that presents an opportunity means transferring the ownership
of the risk to another party that is better equipped to capitalize on the opportunity. Some exam-
ples of sharing are:
     Forming risk-sharing partnerships
     Starting a joint venture with the purpose of capitalizing on an opportunity
     Forming teams or special-purpose companies to exploit opportunities presented by
        positive risks
100   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


       Exploit. Exploiting an opportunity means ensuring that the opportunity is realized--that is,
       the positive risk that presents the opportunity does occur. This is accomplished by eliminating
       or minimizing the uncertainty associated with the risk occurrence. An example of exploiting is
       assigning more talented resources to the project to reduce the completion time and therefore
       to be the first to market. Another example could be to provide better quality than planned to
       beat a competitor. Whereas exploiting refers to ensuring that the positive risk occurs, enhanc-
       ing refers to increasing the impact of the risk once it occurs.
       Enhance. This strategy means increasing the size of the opportunity by increasing the proba-
       bility, impact, or both. You can increase the probability by maximizing the key drivers of the
       positive risks or by strengthening the causes of the risks. Similarly, you can increase the impact
       by increasing the project's susceptibility to the positive risk.
       You have just learned the different strategies that you need to plan for negative and positive
       risks if you intend to take action. If, on the other hand, you intend to take no action or a con-
       ditional action, then the response planning strategies for both negative and positive risks are
       the same.


       Response Strategies for Both Threats and Opportunities
       There are two response strategies that you need to plan for the risks for which you need to take
       either a conditional action or no action.
       Acceptance. Acceptance of a risk means to let it be. Generally, it is not possible to take action
       against all the risks. Depending upon their probabilities and impacts, some risks will simply be
       accepted. There are two kinds of acceptance:
            Passive acceptance that requires no action
            Active acceptance that requires a conditional action, called a contingent response
       Contingency. Generally speaking, contingency means a future event or condition that is pos-
       sible but cannot be predicted with certainty. So, your action will be contingent upon the con-
       dition; that is, it will be executed only if the condition happens. In risk management, a
       contingent response is a response that is executed only if certain predefined conditions (or
       events) happen. These events trigger the contingency response. Some examples of such trig-
       gers are missing a milestone or escalating the priority of a feature by the customer. The events
       that can trigger contingency response must be clearly defined and tracked.
       You use these strategies to generate the output of the risk response planning process.


   Output of Risk Response Planning
       The output of risk response planning might include risk register updates, risk-related contrac-
       tual agreements, and project management plan updates.
                         PLANNING THE RISK RESPONSE                             Chapter 4          101


Risk register updates. The appropriate risk responses planned and agreed upon by the risk
management team are included in the risk register. The responses to high and moderate risks
are entered in detail, while the low-priority risks can be put on a watch list for monitoring.
After the risk register is updated, it includes the following main elements:
     A list of identified risks, descriptions of the risks, root causes of the risks, WBS ele-
        ments affected by the risks, and the impacts of the risks on the project objectives.
        Roles and responsibilities in managing the risks--that is, risk owners and the
        responsibilities assigned to them.
        Results from qualitative and quantitative risk analyses, including a prioritized list of
        risks, a probabilistic analysis of the project objectives, and a list of risks with time
        urgency.
        Planned and agreed-upon risk response strategies and specific actions to implement
        each strategy.
        Symptoms and warning signs of risk occurrences, contingency plans, and triggers for
        contingency risks.
        Budget and schedule requirements to implement the planned responses, including
        the contingency reserve, which is the amount of funds, time, or both needed in addi-
        tion to the estimates in order to meet the organization's and stakeholders' risk toler-
        ances and thresholds.
        Fallback plans in case the planned responses prove to be inadequate.
        A list of risks to remain, which include the following:
         Passive, accepted risks
         Residual risks that will remain after planned responses have been performed
     A list of secondary risks that will arise as a result of implementing the responses.
        You must plan for these risks like any other risk.
Risk-related contractual agreements. The risk-related contractual agreements might result,
for example, from transferring the risks.
Project management plan updates. The project management plan is updated to include the
risk response activities that might affect other project management areas, such as cost and
schedule.


            NOTE
     A residual risk is the remains of a risk on which a response has been performed,
     whereas a secondary risk is a risk that is expected to arise as a result of implement-
     ing a risk response; therefore, a response for a secondary risk must be planned.
102   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


       Risk response planning deals with both kinds of risks--those that pose threats to meeting pro-
       ject objectives and those that present opportunities. Three kinds of responses can be planned--
       take action, take no action, or take a conditional action.
       I have discussed quite a few processes used in quality management and risk management. It is
       time to put them together to show how they are related to each other in the big picture.



   The Big Picture of Quality and
   Risk Management
       In this chapter, I have introduced the processes used in managing the quality and risk of a pro-
       ject. As shown in Figure 4.12, quality management and risk management can begin after the
       project scope planning has been performed to the level of creating the WBS.
       Note that Figure 4.12 presents a general and high-level view of the relationships between dif-
       ferent processes used to manage quality and risk, and not all the interactions and data flow are
       shown. For example, depending on the nature of the risk and the experience of the risk man-
       agement team, a risk might move directly from the identification process to the quantitative
       risk analysis or even to the risk response planning process.

       You might be overwhelmed by the input items that go into various processes. Table 4.4 pre-
       sents a unified picture of the main input items for various quality and risk-related processes.
       Following are the main points emerging from this picture:
             The quality planning and risk management planning processes have identical sets of
             input items.
             The qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk analysis processes also have identi-
             cal sets of input items with one exception: The quantitative risk analysis uses the
             project management plan as an input item, whereas the qualitative risk analysis does
             not.
             The risk register is initiated by the risk identification process and is an input item to,
             and is updated by, the following risk management processes: qualitative risk analysis,
             quantitative risk analysis, and risk response planning.

104   Chapter 4      PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


       The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
            The goal for quality planning is twofold: Identify which quality standards are rele-
            vant to the project at hand and determine how to satisfy these standards.
            The risk identification process initiates the risk register by listing the identified risks
            in it. The qualitative risk analysis prioritizes these risks based on the probability and
            impact matrix for each objective, whereas the emphasis in quantitative risk analysis is
            on assessing the probabilities of meeting each project objective and prioritizing the
            risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project objectives.
            The goal for risk response planning is to minimize the threats (the negative effects
            of risks) and maximize the opportunities (the positive effects of risks).



   Summary
       Quality and risk are two interrelated aspects of any project and need to be managed. While
       quality refers to the degree to which a set of characteristics of project deliverables and objec-
       tives fulfill the requirements, risk refers to an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has
       a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives. Quality management includes
       quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control. The quality management plan, quality
       baseline, and quality metrics are the major output items of the quality planning process. Qual-
       ity planning and risk management planning processes have an identical set of input items--
       enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, project scope statements, and
       project management plans. The only output of risk management planning is the risk manage-
       ment plan, which includes elements such as a list of tools and approaches to be used for risk
       management, identification and assignment of resources for risk management, risk categories,
       risk probabilities and impacts, and the format of risk reporting and tracking. This information
       is used in the remaining processes of risk management--risk identification, risk analysis (qual-
       itative and quantitative), risk response planning, and risk monitoring and control.
       The risk management plan is an input item to the risk identification process. Its only output
       is the risk register, which includes a list of identified risks, a list of the root causes of the risks,
       and an initial list of potential responses. The risk register, initially prepared during the risk iden-
       tification process, is updated during the following processes: qualitative risk analysis, quantita-
       tive risk analysis, risk response planning, and risk monitoring. The main output of qualitative
       risk analysis is the prioritization of risks based on a probability and impact matrix for each
       objective. Each objective might have its own prioritized list of risks. However, the emphasis in
       quantitative analysis is on two things--assessing the probabilities of meeting each project objec-
       tive and prioritizing the risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project objec-
       tives. Subsequently, the resultant prioritized list of risks can be used to prepare the risk response
       plan.
                                                                  SUMMARY                 Chapter 4       105


Depending upon the priority of the risk, you can choose one of the three options--taking no
action, taking an action if some event happens, or taking an action. When you decide to take
an action, there are three ways to plan it: avoid, transfer, or mitigate in case of a negative risk;
and share, exploit, or enhance in case of a positive risk.
After you have planned quality and risk management, you need to proceed toward scheduling
the project before it can begin execution. The planning processes that lead to scheduling the
project are discussed in the following chapter.


Exam's Eye View
 Comprehend

  Risk categorization is a part of the risk management plan and it helps in the risk identifica-
     tion process.

  Defining the risk probability and risk impact are parts of the risk management plan and are
     used in the qualitative risk analysis and in prioritizing risks.

  Risk identification is performed before the risk analysis, and the qualitative risk analysis, if
     performed, is performed before quantitative risk analysis because it takes less effort and time
     and its results can be used for quantitative analysis.

  An important update added to the risk register by the qualitative risk analysis is the priori-
     tized list of risks. Each objective can have its own prioritized list of risks.

  Two important updates added to the risk register by the quantitative risk analysis are:
      The probabilistic analysis of the project objectives--that is, the probability of meeting the
         project objectives.

      The prioritized list of risks based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project
         objectives.

 Look Out

  Risk stems from elements of uncertainty and can have a negative or positive effect on meeting
     the project objectives.

  Quality planning and risk management planning processes have identical sets of input items.
  The only difference between the inputs to the qualitative risk analysis and those to the quan-
     titative risk analysis is that the quantitative risk analysis has the project management plan as
     an input item, whereas the qualitative risk analysis does not.

  Depending upon the experience of the team and the nature of the risk, a risk can be moved
     directly after identification to the quantitative risk analysis or even to risk response planning.
106   Chapter 4     PLANNING QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT


        Memorize

         The quality management plan, quality baseline, and quality metrics are the major output items
            of the quality planning process.

         The risk register is initially prepared during the risk identification process and is updated dur-
            ing the following processes: qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, risk response
            planning, and risk monitoring.

         The risk register becomes part of the project management plan.
         The input to the risk identification process contains all the items that are input to the risk man-
            agement planning process, plus it contains the risk management plan as an input item, too.

         The only output of risk management planning is the risk management plan.



   Key Terms
            assumptions analysis. A technique used to examine the validity of an assumption
               and thereby identify the risk resulting from the inaccuracy, inconsistency, or incom-
               pleteness of each assumption.
               benchmarking. Benchmarking is comparing practices, products, or services of a pro-
               ject with those of some reference projects for the purposes of learning, improvement,
               and creating the basis for measuring performance.
               confidence level. A statistical term that refers to the certainty attached to an esti-
               mate and is often represented in percentage form, such as a 95% confidence level.
               contingency. A future event or condition that is possible but cannot be predicted
               with certainty. In this case, an action will be contingent upon the condition--that is,
               the action will be executed only if the condition happens.
               contingency reserve. The amount of funds, time, or both needed in addition to the
               estimates in order to meet the organization's and stakeholders' risk tolerances and
               thresholds.
               decision tree analysis. A technique that uses a decision tree diagram to choose from
               different options available; each option is represented by a branch of the tree. EMV
               analysis is done along each branch, which helps to make a decision about which
               option to choose.
               Delphi technique. An information-gathering technique used for experts to reach a
               consensus while sharing their ideas and preferences anonymously.
               Expected Monetary Value (EMV) analysis. A statistical technique used to calculate
               the expected outcome when there are multiple possible outcome values with proba-
               bilities assigned to them.

                             progress will be measured.
Introduction
  A project consists of two main components: the project work that needs to be performed and
  the schedule to perform that work. The overall project work is broken down into smaller man-
  ageable components. These components in the WBS are called work packages. However, a
  work package might not be suitable to assign to an individual to perform. So, work packages
  can be decomposed into smaller components called activities. A project schedule contains not
  only the activities to be performed, but also the order (sequence) in which the activities will be
  performed. The sequencing of activities is determined by dependencies among the activities.
  A realistic project schedule can be created from the bottom up by identifying the activities, esti-
  mating the resources for the activities, and determining the time that each activity will take
  with the given resources available. The resources required to complete the activities include
  human resources. The core issue in this chapter is how to plan the project schedule. To enable
  you to put your arms around this issue, I will explore the following three avenues: generating
  the data about project activities, such as determining resource requirements and activity dura-
  tion, building a project schedule from the data on the activities, and planning human resources
  that will perform the activities.



The Long and Winding Road to the
Project Schedule
  Planning the project schedule is all about time management. To complete a project, you need
  to perform some activities to produce the project deliverables. To make that happen, you need
  to assign resources to the activities and schedule them. But before all this can happen, you
  need to identify the activities. Although all this sounds like common sense, it makes sense to
  define the following terms so we are all on the same page.
       Activity. A component of project work.
       Activity duration. The time measured in calendar units between the start and finish
          of a schedule activity.
       Schedule activity. A scheduled task (component of work) performed during the life-
       cycle of a project.
       Logical relationship. A dependency between two project schedule activities or
       between a schedule activity and a schedule milestone.
THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD TO THE PROJECT SCHEDULE                                    Chapter 5       115


         Schedule milestone. A milestone is a significant point (or event) in the life of a
            project, and a schedule milestone is a milestone on the project schedule. A milestone
            refers to the completion of an activity, marking possibly the completion of a set of
            activities, and therefore has zero duration. The completion of a major deliverable is
            an example of a milestone.
    Project time management includes the processes required to complete the project in a timely
    manner. Figure 5.1 presents the flow diagram for the time management processes that lead to
    schedule development.




        FIGURE 5.1 The time management processes that lead to schedule development

    The usages of these processes are listed here:
         Activity definition. Identifies the specific schedule activities that must be performed
            to produce the project deliverables.
            Activity sequencing. Identifies the dependencies among the schedule activities and
            orders the activities accordingly.
            Activity resource estimating. Estimates the types and amounts of resources that
            will be required to perform each schedule activity.
            Activity duration estimating. Estimates the time in work periods individually for
            each schedule activity required for the activity's completion. A work period is a mea-
            surement of time when the work is in progress; it is measured in hours, days, or
            months, depending upon the size of the activity. This estimate is performed for
            given resources.
            Schedule development. Helps create the project schedule by analyzing schedule
            activity sequences, schedule activity durations, resource requirements, and schedule
            constraints.
116   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE



                    NOTE
             The underlying philosophy of project management for schedule development is to first
             develop the schedule based on the work required to complete the project tasks, and then
             see how you can make it conform to other constraints, calendar requirements, and strate-
             gic goals of the organization. You, the project manager, build the schedule through cold,
             hard mathematical analysis and you don't just accept whatever schedule goals come
             down the pipeline from elsewhere, such as from the customer or the project sponsor.


       In a nutshell, the path to schedule development includes defining activities, arranging the activ-
       ities in the correct order, and estimating the resources required to complete the activities. In
       other words, the work necessary for completing the project is expressed in terms of activities,
       and the resources are required to complete the activities. So, the first step toward schedule plan-
       ning after creating the WBS is defining activities.



   Defining Activities
       Activities that need to be performed to produce the project deliverables are identified using
       the activity definition process shown in Figure 5.2. The starting point for defining the activi-
       ties is the lowest level of the WBS that contains work packages. Each work package can be
       broken down into one or more activities.
       So, the key input items to the activity definition process are the WBS and the WBS dictionary.

Input to Activity Definition
    Identifying project activities starts with the work packages in the WBS, which in turn are
    derived from the project scope statement. These two obvious input items, along with others,
    are discussed here:
         WBS and WBS dictionary. The work packages in the WBS are decomposed into
            project activities. To assign appropriate resources to these work packages, you need
            to know their details, which are provided in the WBS dictionary.
            Project scope statement. The WBS is built from the project scope statement. While
            dealing with the WBS, you might need to go back to the project scope statement.
            The following elements of the project scope statement are especially important to
            consider while identifying activities:
             Assumptions related to the activities or schedule planning, such as work hours
                per week
             Constraints that will limit the schedule options, such as predetermined deadlines
                on project milestones
             Project deliverables, to ensure everything is covered in WBS work packages
            Project management plan. The elements in the project management plan that can
            be useful for the activity definition process include the project scope management
            plan and the schedule management plan, which can provide guidance on identifying
            and scheduling activities.
            Enterprise environmental factors. The enterprise environmental factors relevant to
            identifying schedule activities include project management information systems and
            project scheduling software tools.
            Organizational process assets. Following are examples of organizational process
            assets that can be useful in the process of identifying activities:
             Organizational policies related to activity planning
             Organizational procedures and guidelines used in defining activities
             Knowledge base of lessons learned from previous projects regarding activity lists
    So, the major input to the activity definition process is the WBS, whose work packages are
    decomposed into activities using some tools and techniques discussed in the following section.


Tools and Techniques for Activity Definition
    The major task in the activity definition process is to decompose the work packages in the WBS
    into activities. This decomposition, along with other tools and techniques, is discussed here.
    Decomposition. Recall that you used the decomposition technique to create the WBS by
    subdividing the project deliverables into smaller manageable tasks called work packages. Decom-
    position is also used in the activity definition process for subdividing the work packages into
    smaller, more manageable components called schedule activities.
118   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE




                   TIP
             You create the WBS and decompose the work packages to project activities with the
             help of the project team. Even though the schedule is not yet developed and the
             resources are not fully assigned, the project team in some initial form will be there.
             When decomposing a work package into activities, involve the individuals who either
             are familiar with the work packages or will be responsible for them.


       Expert judgment. During the process of decomposing the work packages into schedule activ-
       ities, you can use the help of team members and other experts who are experienced in devel-
       oping WBS and project schedules.
       Planning components for rolling wave planning. If there are areas of the project scope for
       which sufficient information is not available yet, there will definitely be corresponding com-
       ponents in the WBS that are not decomposed to the level of work packages. You can only
       develop a high-level schedule for these planning components. You accommodate this kind of
       high-level scheduling by using a technique called rolling wave planning to plan the project work
       at various levels of detail depending upon the availability of information. Work to be performed
       in the near future is planned to the low level of the WBS, whereas work to be performed far
       into the future can be planned at the relatively high level of the WBS. So, a WBS component
       at the bottom level of a branch of WBS hierarchy for which some planning can be performed
       is called a planning component. The planning components for which insufficient information is
       available to decompose them into work packages fall into the following two categories:
            Control account. From the management perspective, a control line is drawn in the
            WBS hierarchy levels. All planning components above this line belong to what is
            called the control account. All efforts performed for components in a control account
            are documented in the corresponding control account plan.
            Planning packages. The WBS components that are below the level of the control
            account and above the level of work packages are called planning packages. A plan-
            ning package can have a budget, estimated start and finish dates, and a statement of
            work. The planning packages are ultimately converted into work packages.


                   NOTE
             Rolling wave planning is an example of progressive elaboration, which was discussed
             in Chapter 1.

    Templates. As a timesaver and a guide, you can use a standard activity list or an activity list
    from a previous project similar to the project at hand as a template. The template can also con-
    tain information about the activities in it, such as required hours of effort.
    Using these techniques, you convert the work packages in the WBS into schedule activities,
    which, along with some other items, make the output of the activity definition process.


Output of Activity Definition
    The key output item of the activity definition process is a comprehensive list of all the sched-
    ule activities that need to be performed to produce the project deliverables. This and other
    output items are discussed in this section.
    Activity list. This is a list of all the activities that are necessary and sufficient to produce the
    project deliverables. In other words, these activities are derived from the WBS and hence are
    within the scope of the project. Also, the scope of each schedule activity should be described
    to sufficient detail in concrete terms, so that the team member responsible for it will under-
    stand what work needs to be performed. Examples of schedule activities include a book chap-
    ter with a summary of content, a computer program that will accomplish a well-defined task,
    and an application to be installed on a computer.
    Activity attributes. These attributes are in addition to the scope description of the activity in
    the activity list. The list of attributes of an activity can include the following:
            Activity identifier and code
            Activity description
            Assumptions and constraints related to this activity, such as imposed date
            Predecessor and successor activities
            Resource requirements
            Team member responsible for performing the work and information about the work
    These attributes are used to arrange the activities in the correct order (sequencing) and to
    schedule them.
    Milestone list. A schedule milestone is a significant event in the project schedule, such as the
    completion of a major deliverable. A milestone can be mandatory, such as one required by a
    contract, or optional, such as one determined by the team to run the project more smoothly.
    The milestone list includes all the milestones and specifies whether a milestone is mandatory
    or optional. Milestones are used in building the schedule.


                 NOTE
          Once developed, the milestone list becomes part of the project management plan.
120   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       Requested changes. When you are converting the WBS elements to project activities, you
       might find problems with the WBS or with the project scope statement. For example, you
       might discover some holes in the scope or some gray areas, or you might realize that a deliv-
       erable cannot be produced within an imposed date. In such a case, you need to make change
       requests, which must be processed through the integrated change control process.
       To summarize, the major output items of the activity definition process are a schedule activity
       list, a list of attributes for each activity, and a list of milestones. Before you can schedule them,
       the identified activities need to be arranged in the correct order, which is called sequencing.



   Sequencing Schedule Activities
       The activity sequencing process is used to arrange the schedule activities in the appropriate
       order, which takes into account the dependencies among the activities. For example, if activity
       B depends upon the product of activity A, then activity A must be performed before activity
       B. So the activity sequencing has a two-pronged goal--to identify the dependencies among
       the schedule activities and to order the activities accordingly. Figure 5.3 shows the activity
       sequencing process.
       Comparing Figure 5.3 with Figure 5.2 reveals that all the output items of the activity defini-
       tion process are the input into the activity sequencing process. Of course, only the approved
       change requests will make it into the plan. The project scope statement is an additional input
       item, and it can be used as a source to check the accuracy of the activity list and to ensure that
       the activity list covers the scope of the project.
       You use the appropriate tools and techniques to determine the dependencies among the sched-
       ule activities and sequence them accordingly.

Tools and Techniques for Activity Sequencing
   Dependency determination is the prerequisite to determine sequencing. Therefore, most of
   the tools and techniques used for sequencing are focused on determining and displaying the
   dependencies.
   Dependency determination. To properly sequence the schedule activities, you need to deter-
   mine the dependencies among them. As illustrated in Figure 5.4, a dependency relationship
   between two activities is defined by two terms: predecessor and successor. In other words, when
   two activities are in a dependency relationship with each other, one of them is a predecessor of
   the other, and the other one is the successor. In Figure 5.4, activity A is a predecessor of activ-
   ity B, and activity B is successor of activity A. That means A must start before B.




       FIGURE 5.4 Predecessor/successor relationship between two activities

   By definition, the successor activity must start after the predecessor activity has already started.
   But exactly when can the successor activity start after the predecessor activity has already been
   started? Well, both the predecessor and the successor have a start and a finish, and there are at
   maximum four possible combinations between the start and finish points of the predecessor
   and the successor activities. Accordingly, there are four kinds of dependencies, also called
   precedence relationships, listed here:
        Finish to start. The initiation of the successor activity depends upon the completion
        of the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be started until the
        predecessor activity has already been completed.
        Finish to finish. The completion of the successor activity depends upon the comple-
        tion of the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be completed
        until the predecessor activity has already been completed.
        Start to start. The initiation of the successor activity depends upon the initiation of
        the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be initiated until the
        predecessor activity has already been initiated.
        Start to finish. The completion of the successor activity depends upon the initiation
        of the predecessor activity--that is, the successor activity cannot be completed until
        the predecessor activity has already been initiated.
122   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       These types of dependencies describe the logical relationships between activities. Where do
       these relationships come from? To answer this question, the dependencies can be grouped into
       three categories:
            Mandatory dependencies. These are the dependencies inherent to the schedule activ-
            ities. For example, a software program must be developed before it can be tested.
            Discretionary dependencies. These are the dependencies at the discretion of the
            project management team. For example, it was possible to perform activities A and
            B simultaneously or to perform A after B was finished, but the team decided, for
            whatever reason, to perform B after A was finished. Some of the guidelines for
            establishing discretionary dependencies can come from the knowledge of best prac-
            tices within the given application area and from the previous experience of perform-
            ing a similar project.
            External dependencies. An external dependency involves a relationship between a
            project activity and a non-project activity--that is, an activity outside the project.
            For example, in a movie production project, think of a project activity that involves
            shooting scenes with lots of tourists skiing. This scene is planned to be shot at a ski-
            ing resort during the skiing season. This is an example of an external dependency.
       The dependency between two schedule activities is an example of the logical relationships
       defined earlier in this chapter. Logical relationships can be displayed in schematic diagrams,
       called project schedule network diagrams, or just network diagrams for brevity. There are two
       commonly used methods to construct these diagrams: the precedence diagramming method
       (PDM) and the arrow diagramming method (ADM).
       Precedence diagramming method (PDM). The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is
       the method to construct a project schedule network diagram in which a box (for example, a
       rectangle) is used to represent an activity and an arrow is used to represent dependency between
       two activities. The boxes representing activities are called nodes. Figure 5.5 presents an exam-
       ple of a network diagram constructed by using PDM, in which activity A is a predecessor of
       activity B, activity C is a predecessor of activities D and G, and so on.
       In this diagram, only C and I have more than one successor. In general, PDM supports all four
       kinds of precedence relationships discussed earlier, but the most commonly used dependency
       relationship in PDM is finish-to-start.
       Although PDM is the most commonly used method, if you are only going to use the finish-
       to-start dependencies, the arrow diagramming method is another option to consider.
       Arrow diagramming method (ADM). The arrow diagramming method (ADM) is the method
       to construct a project schedule network diagram in which a node (represented by a circle) acts
       as a junction between the predecessor activity and the successor activity, and the activity itself
       is represented by an arrow. The arrow representing an activity also points to the successor activ-
       ity through a junction. However, there is a problem inherent to this definition. The problem
       arises from the fact that an activity might have multiple successors, multiple predecessors, or
       both. In such cases, you might need more arrows to show the dependencies than the number of
                    SEQUENCING SCHEDULE ACTIVITIES                               Chapter 5       123


activities. But an arrow does not just show the relationship; in ADM, it also represents an activ-
ity. So, you cannot have more than one arrow for one activity. How would you then represent,
for example, that an activity has more than one successor? This problem is solved by introduc-
ing the concept of a dummy activity, represented by a broken arrow that is just used to show the
relationship and does not represent any real activity.
Figure 5.6 displays a set of dependencies identical to that shown in Figure 5.5. The only dif-
ference between the two diagrams is that Figure 5.6 uses ADM instead of PDM, which was
used in Figure 5.5. Note the use of dummy activities in Figure 5.6 to show the dependency
between C and G, and between I and G.
Note that ADM is only used to represent finish-to-start types of dependencies.

       Applying leads and lags. The finish-to-start dependency means that the successor activity
       starts where the predecessor activity finishes. Applying a lead means you allow the successor
       activity to start before the predecessor activity finishes, and applying a lag means you start the
       successor activity a few days after the predecessor activity finishes. Sometimes you might need
       to make such adjustments in the schedule.
       Schedule network templates. You can use the standardized network diagram templates to
       save time to expedite the process of activity sequencing. You can also use the network diagrams
       from previous projects and modify them for the project at hand.
       Finish-to-start is the most commonly used precedence relationship in the PDM diagramming
       method, although this method can also be used to represent the other three precedence rela-
       tionships: finish-to-finish, start-to-start, and start-to-finish. The ADM method can only be
       used to show the finish-to-start relationship.
       You use these methods to construct project schedule network diagrams, which are the major
       output of the activity sequencing process.


   Output of Activity Sequencing
       The goal of the activity sequencing process is to determine the dependencies among the
       schedule activities and sequence the activities accordingly. The sequencing is presented in net-
       work diagrams. Following are the output items from the activity sequencing process:
            Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams, discussed in the previous sec-
               tion, can be created manually or by using an appropriate project management soft-
               ware application. Depending upon a project's size, you might have multiple network
               diagrams for it.
            Requested changes. During the activity sequencing process, you might need to
            make changes to the activity list, the activity attributes, or both. For example, you
            might need to redefine an activity, decompose an activity into two, and so on. This
            situation will generate change requests, which must go through the integrated
            change control process for approval.
            Updated activity list and attribute list. Once approved, the requested changes
            regarding the activities must be added to the activity list. The attribute list must be
            updated accordingly as well.
       You can make the activity list, and you can sequence the activities. These are important steps
       that must be executed. However, to perform the activities, you need resources.
    ESTIMATING ACTIVITY RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS                                          Chapter 5      125


Estimating Activity Resource
Requirements
   The resource requirements for an activity are estimated by using the activity resource estimat-
   ing process. The main purpose of this process is to accomplish the following goals:
        Estimate the types of resources needed for a given activity
        Estimate the quantities of each type of resource needed for the activity
   Figure 5.7 shows the activity resource estimating process with its input, tools and techniques,
   and output.
   The activity list and attributes determined by the activity definition process are the major
   input items to the activity resource estimating process.




       FIGURE 5.7 The activity resource estimating process: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input to Activity Resource Estimating
   The activity list and attributes are the obvious and major input to the activity resource esti-
   mating process. These and other input items are discussed in the following list.
        Activity list and activity attributes. The activity list originally developed during the
           activity definition process identifies the schedule activities that need the resources.
           The activity attributes provide the details for the activities, which will be helpful in
           estimating the resources.
        Enterprise environmental factors. Information about the infrastructure of the per-
           forming organization, such as existing facilities, will be used in identifying the
           resources and their availability.
126   Chapter 5    PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


            Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets useful for activity
            resource estimating include organizational policies for staffing and purchase of sup-
            plies, historical information on what types of resources were used for similar activi-
            ties in a previous project, and the like.
            Project management plan. Some components of the project management plan can
            be used in activity resource estimating. A schedule management plan, a component
            of the project management plan, is an obvious example that can be used in resource
            estimating.
            Availability of resources. Resource estimating will require information on the avail-
            able quantity of resources of different types, such as human, equipment, and material.
       Once you understand the activities, you can use some tools and techniques to determine the
       resources required to perform those activities.


   Tools and Techniques for Activity Resource Estimating
       Following are the tools and techniques used to determine the resources required to perform
       schedule activities.
            Alternative analysis. You will need to consider alternatives available for resources
            needed for some schedule activities. For example, you might need to decide whether
            you want to buy or develop a tool needed to perform an activity, what types of
            machines (for example, Windows or Linux) to use, which computers to use to do the
            development, or what level of skills is needed.
            Bottom-up estimating. You might discover that it is rather complex to estimate
            resources for a given schedule activity. If the problem is inherent to the activity, it
            might be helpful in certain cases to decompose the activity into smaller components
            for the purpose of resource estimating, then estimate the resource for each compo-
            nent, and then aggregate the resources to get an estimate for the whole activity. In
            aggregation, you must consider the possible relationships (overlaps and such) among
            different components of the activity so you don't double-count the resources.
            Expert judgment. Expert judgment can be used to assess the input and output of
            the resource estimating process.
            Published estimating data. Information published by various vendors, such as costs
            for resources, can be useful in estimating the resources.
            Project management software. Depending upon the sophistication of the resource
            requirements, project management software might be useful in estimating and man-
            aging the resources.
       You can use a combination of these tools and techniques to generate the output of the resource
       estimating process.
                            ESTIMATING ACTIVITY DURATION                           Chapter 5       127


Output of Activity Resource Estimating
   The resource requirements are the major output of the resource estimating process. These and
   other output items are discussed in the following list.
   Activity resource requirements. The main purpose of the activity resource estimating process
   is to determine the resource requirements for each schedule activity, and therefore this is the
   major output item from this process. You identify the types of resources required to perform
   each activity and estimate the required quantity of each identified resource. If a work package
   in the WBS has multiple activities, the resource estimates for those activities can be aggregated
   to estimate the resource requirements for the work package, if needed.
   Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical
   structure of resource types required to complete the schedule activities of a project. The RBS
   can be used to identify and analyze the project human resource assignments.
   Updated activity attributes. The identified types of required resources for an activity and the
   estimated quantity for each identified resource become activity attributes and must be added
   to the attribute list for the activity.
   Resource calendar. The resource calendar contains the following useful information about the
   resources:
           Days and times of day when a resource is available
           The passive time for the resource--for example, holidays for human resources
           The quantity of each type of available resource
           The capability of each resource
   Requested changes. The activity resource estimating process might generate change requests
   in the activity list--for example, to add or delete an activity. These change requests must be
   processed through the integrated change control process.
   Once the activities have been identified and resources required to perform each activity have
   been estimated, you have enough information to begin estimating the time needed to com-
   plete each activity, which is called the activity duration.



Estimating Activity Duration
   Activity duration is the time in calendar units between start and finish of a schedule activity.
   Activity duration is estimated in work periods by using the activity duration estimating process.
   A work period is a measurement of time when the work is in progress; it is measured in hours,
   days, or months, depending upon the size of the activity. This estimate can be converted to
   calendar units of time by factoring in the resource's passive time, such as holidays. For exam-
   ple, suppose you have estimated that it will take one programmer four days (with eight work
128   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       hours in a day) to write a program. You also know that the work will start on a Friday and
       there will be no work on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the activity duration estimate is four
       days (or 32 hours) measured in work periods and six days measured in calendar units.
       Figure 5.8 shows the input, tools and techniques, and output for the activity duration estimat-
       ing process.




           FIGURE 5.8 The activity duration estimating process: input, tools and techniques, and output


   Input to Activity Duration Estimating
       To estimate the activity duration, you will need information about the activity, the resource
       requirements for the activity, and the resources available for the activity. This underlines the
       major input items to the activity duration estimating process. These and other input items are
       discussed here.
       Activity list and activity attributes. Because you want to estimate the duration of the activi-
       ties, the activity list along with the activity attributes, originally developed in the activity def-
       inition process, are the obvious input items to the activity duration estimating process.
       Activity resource requirements. The work periods required to complete an activity depend
       on the resources assigned to the activity. For example, suppose it will take four work days to
       complete an activity that involves having two programmers write two programs. If only one
                         ESTIMATING ACTIVITY DURATION                            Chapter 5       129


programmer is available, it will take roughly eight work days to finish this activity. However,
while assigning additional resources to an activity, always consider the following:
     Sometimes assigning additional resources might reduce the overall efficiency and
     productivity. For example, think of two engineers with different skill levels assigned
     to work on the interrelated components of an activity.
     Most of the activities have a threshold beyond which assigning additional resources
     does not help. For example, installing an operating system on a machine will take
     the same amount of time regardless of how many system administrators have been
     assigned to this activity.
Resource calendar. The resource calendar, developed during the activity resource estimating
process, contains the type, quantity, availability, and capability of each resource, including the
skills of a human resource, which must be considered during activity duration estimating. For
example, an experienced programmer can finish the same program in less time than a begin-
ner can. Capability and quantity of available resources, both human and material, can affect
the activity duration estimate. For example, if an activity will take four work days for an engi-
neer to finish, and the engineer can work only four hours a day on this activity, it will take
eight work days to finish.
Project scope statement. Some assumptions and constraints in the project scope statement
can affect activity duration estimates and therefore must be considered. For example, there
might be an assumption that part of the work related to an activity has already been performed
in a previous project and can be used in this project. If the assumption is true, the activity
duration will be less than otherwise. An example of a constraint might be that a specific work
package must be finished before a predetermined deadline. This will put a maximum limit on
the duration for the activities corresponding to this work package.
Project management plan. The following components of the project management plan are use-
ful for activity duration estimating:
     Activity cost estimates. Within the project budget, there will be cost estimates
     assigned to each activity. This estimate will have an effect on the quantity of the
     resources you can use for the activity.
     Risk register. The risk register, originally developed during the risk identification
     process, contains the list of project risks, which must be considered while estimating
     durations for activities because these risks can influence activity durations. The effect
     of highly probable risks with high impacts must especially be considered and taken
     into account in the duration estimates.
Enterprise environmental factors. Examples of enterprise environmental factors are some
databases that contain the reference data relevant to the activity duration--for instance, how
long it takes for a specific government agency to respond to a request.
130   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       Organizational assets. Organizational assets that will be useful in estimating activity duration
       include information from previous projects and a calendar of working days and non-working
       days.
       In a nutshell, the activity list and activity resource requirements are the major inputs to the
       activity duration process. The activity duration estimate is a non-trivial task, and there are var-
       ious tools and techniques available to perform this task effectively and reliably.


   Tools and Techniques for Activity Duration Estimating
       The project schedule depends upon the activity duration estimates. The duration estimates of
       activities on the critical path will determine the finish date of a project for a given start date.
       However, there might be many uncertainties involved in the estimate. For example, two pro-
       grammers, due to the differences in their experience, will take different amounts of time to
       write the same program. The good news is that there are a number of tools and techniques
       that you can use in activity duration estimating.
       Analogous estimating. Analogous estimating techniques estimate the duration of an activity
       based on the duration of a similar activity in a previous project. The accuracy of the estimate
       depends upon how similar the activities are and whether the team member who will perform
       the activity has the same level of expertise and experience as the team member from the pre-
       vious project. This technique is useful when there is not enough detail information about the
       project or a project activity available--for example, in the early stages of a project.
       Parametric estimating. This is a quantitative technique used to calculate the activity duration
       when the productivity rate of the resource performing the activity is available. You use a for-
       mula such as the following one to calculate the duration:
               Activity duration = Units of work in the activity / Productivity rate of the resources
       For example, if you know that a team assigned to the activity of burying 40 miles of cable can
       bury two miles of cable in one day, the duration calculation can be performed as follows:
               Activity duration = 40 miles / (2 miles/day) = 20 days
       Three-point estimating. This method addresses the issue of uncertainty in estimating the
       activity duration. The uncertainty in the duration estimate can be calculated by making a three-
       point estimate in which each point corresponds to one of the following estimate types:
            Most likely scenario. The activity duration is calculated in most practical terms by
            factoring in resources likely to be assigned, realistic expectations of the resources,
            dependencies, and interruptions.
            Optimistic scenario. This is the best case version of the situation described in the
            most likely scenario.
            Pessimistic scenario. This is the worst case version of the situation described in the
            most likely scenario.
                              ESTIMATING ACTIVITY DURATION                               Chapter 5       131


   The spread of these three estimates determines the uncertainty. The resultant duration is cal-
   culated by taking the average of the three estimates. For example, if the duration for an activ-
   ity is estimated to be 20 days for the most likely scenario, 18 days for the optimistic scenario,
   and 22 days for the pessimistic scenario, then the average duration is 20 days and the uncer-
   tainty is  2 days, which can be expressed as:
            Duration = 20  2 days
   It's equivalent to saying that the activity duration is 20 days, give or take two days.
   Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to incorporate a time cushion into your schedule; this
   cushion is called a contingency reserve, a time reserve, or a time buffer. The whole idea is to accom-
   modate the possibility of schedule risks. One method of calculating the contingency reserve is
   to take a percentage of the original activity duration estimate as the contingency reserve. Later,
   when more information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve can be
   reduced or eliminated.
   Expert judgment. Expert judgment can be used to estimate the whole duration of an activity
   when not enough information is available. It can also be used to estimate some parameters to
   be used in other methods--for example, what percentage of the original activity duration esti-
   mate should be used as a contingency reserve--and in comparing an activity to a similar activ-
   ity in a previous project during analogous estimating.
   Note that, in general, a combination of techniques is used to estimate the duration of an activ-
   ity. For example, you can use the analogous technique and expert judgment to estimate the
   productivity rate of resources, and then use that productivity rate in parametric analysis to cal-
   culate the activity duration.


Output of Activity Duration Estimating
   Guess what the output of the activity duration estimating process is. Yes, you are right: It is
   the activity duration estimates! Regardless of which technique you use, these estimates are
   quantitative assessments of the required time units to finish activities, such as five days or 10
   weeks. As shown earlier, you can also assign an uncertainty to the estimate, such as 202 days
   to say that the activity will take at least 18 days and at most 22 days.
   The duration of an activity is an attribute of the activity. Therefore, you update the activity attrib-
   utes, originally developed in the activity definition process, to include the activity durations.
   In a nutshell, there are two output items of the activity duration estimating process:
        Activity duration estimates
        Updates to activity attributes
   By using various processes discussed in this chapter, you have identified schedule activities,
   arranged them in proper sequence, determined resource requirements for them, and estimated
   their durations. All these tasks and accomplishments are a means to an end called project sched-
   ule development.
132   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE



   Developing the Project Schedule
       The project work is composed of individual activities. So, the processes previously discussed in
       this chapter deal with the activities. By using these processes, you work out a few schedule-
       related pieces at the activity level, which come together as the project schedule when you crank
       them through the schedule development process. Until you have a realistic project schedule,
       you do not have a project. A project schedule has schedule activities sandwiched between the
       project start date and the project finish date. Figure 5.9 shows the schedule development
       process used to develop the project schedule.
       The major output items of all the processes discussed in this chapter are the input to the
       schedule development process.

   Input to Schedule Development
       The following output items from the schedule-related processes discussed in this chapter

   The project scope statement and project management plan are two other input items that can
   be useful in ways described in the following list.
   Project scope statement. The assumptions and constraints in the project scope statement can
   affect the project schedule and therefore must be considered in developing the schedule. The
   following two types of time-related constraints should get special attention.
        Hard deadlines on start and finish dates. Some activities or work packages might
            have constraints on their start or finish dates. For example, there might be a situa-
            tion in which an activity cannot be started before a certain date, or must be finished
            before a certain date, or both. Where do these date constraints come from? They can
            come from various sources, such as a date in the contract, a date determined by the
            market window, delivery of material from an external vendor, and the like.
        Time constraints on deliverables. These constraints can come from the customer,
            the sponsor, or any other stakeholder in terms of deadlines for certain major deliver-
            ables or milestones. Other projects inside or outside your organization might be
            depending on these constraints. So, once scheduled, these deadlines are constraints
            and can only be changed through the approval process.
   Project management plan. The following components of the project management plan can be
   useful in developing the project schedule:
           Cost management plan
           Project risk management plan, especially the risk register
           Project scope management plan
           Schedule management plan
   So, the output of various time management processes is used as input to the schedule devel-
   opment process, which uses a variety of tools and techniques to iron out the project schedule.


Tools and Techniques for Schedule Development
   Once you have the network diagrams for the activities, as well as the activity duration estimates,
   you are well-equipped to start scheduling the project. The remaining main concerns include
   the following:
           The actual start date
           Uncertainty on the availability of resources
           Identification of and preparation for activities on the critical path
           Risks involved, or "what if " scenarios
           The hard start/finish dates for activities or for the project that came down the
           pipeline from very important stakeholders
   Various tools and techniques discussed in this section can be used to address these concerns
   while you are hammering out the project schedule.
134   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       Schedule Network Analysis
       A schedule network analysis is a technique used to generate a project schedule by identifying
       the early and late start and finish dates for the project. The analysis accomplishes this task by
       employing a schedule model and various analytical techniques, such as critical path method,
       critical chain method, "what if " analysis, and resource leveling. These techniques are discussed
       in this section.
       Schedule model. You know by now that the resource requirements and activity durations are
       the estimates based on some assumptions, such as that a typical programmer will take five days
       to write a certain program. However, you use this data to build the project schedule. Chang-
       ing the assumptions will change the data, hence the schedule. So, a set of assumptions on which
       this data is based is called a schedule model.
       Critical path method. This is the schedule network analysis technique used to identify the
       schedule flexibility and the critical path of the project schedule network diagram. The critical
       path is the longest path (sequence of activities) in a project schedule network diagram. Because
       it is the longest path, it determines the duration of the project, and hence the finish date of the
       project given the start date. An example will explain this. Consider the network diagram pre-
       sented in Figure 5.10. The boxes in the figure represent activities, such as activity A followed
       by activity B, and the number on top of a box represents the duration of the activity in time
       units, such as days.
       Table 5.1 shows the calculations for the duration of each path of the network diagram by adding
       the durations of the individual activities on the path. You can see from Table 5.1 that the path
       Start-F-G-H-Finish is the critical path because it is the longest path in the diagram, at 21
       days. This means if the project start date is January 2, the project finish date will be January 23
       (2+21), given that the duration is shown in calendar time units.




           FIGURE 5.10 An example of a project schedule network diagram. The duration of an activity is
                           represented by the number shown on top of the box that represents the activity.

 Start-I-J-H-Finish                5+4+8                             17


The second important feature of the critical path method is to identify the flexibility in the
project schedule by calculating the early and late start and finish dates of each activity on each
path. The schedule flexibility of an activity is measured by the positive difference between the
late start date and the early start date for the activity, and is called float time or total float.
Table 5.2 shows calculations for the early and late start and finish dates and the float time for
each activity in the network diagram being analyzed. The early start and finish dates of activi-
ties on a path are calculated by using the forward-pass method, which means you start your cal-
culations from the start point (left-most) and make your way forward. As an example, consider
the path Start-A-B-Finish in the network diagram shown in Figure 5.10. Because A is the first
activity on the path, its early start is day 0. Because B depends on the completion of A, and A
takes five days to finish, the early start date for B is the early start date of A plus
the duration of A--that is, 0 + 5 = 5. The late start and finish dates are calculated using
the backward-pass method, which means you start your calculations from the finish point. The
project finish date determined by the critical path is day 21, given that the project start date
is day 0. Because activity B has a duration of three days, it must be started no later than day 18
(21 - 3 = 18). Therefore, day 18 is the late start date of activity B. Activity A has duration of
five days, so given that B must start on day 18, A must not start later than day 13 (18 - 5 = 13).
Therefore the late start date for A is day 13. The float times are calculated as follows:
        Float time for A = late start - early start = 13 - 0 = 13
        Float time for B = late start - early start = 18 - 5 = 13
Note that each of the activities on the critical path (F, G, and H) has a float time of zero. This
obviously is a source of schedule risk.


             NOTE
      Each activity on a critical path has zero float time, and therefore poses a schedule
      risk. Therefore, you must monitor the activities on all critical paths very closely during
      the execution of the project.

       Critical chain method. This is an alternative schedule network analysis technique that takes
       into account the uncertainties of the activity durations due the uncertainty of the availability
       of resources. It uses the schedule network diagrams to identify the critical paths and the sched-
       ule flexibility, just like the critical path method. The only difference is that in this technique,
       you work from more than one network diagram. For example, the durations in the first net-
       work are based on the planned scenario regarding the availability of resources. You can draw
       another network diagram based on the pessimistic scenario regarding the availability of
       resources. The durations of some activities in the second diagram will be longer than the first
       diagram, and the second diagram might even have a different or an additional critical path. The
       extra durations in the second diagram are called duration buffers. So, the focus of the critical
       chain method is on managing the duration buffers and the uncertainties in the availability of
       resources applied to the planned schedule activities.
       Resource leveling. Resource leveling is not an independent schedule network analysis method.
       It is applied to the schedule that has already been analyzed using other methods, such as the
       critical path method or the critical chain method. The resource leveling technique is applied to
       address the resource needs of activities that must be performed to meet specific delivery dates.
       Resource leveling involves taking a part of the resources from one activity and assigning it to
       another. This will change the activity durations and can also result in a change of critical paths.
       "What if " scenario analysis. The purpose of the "what if " scenario analysis is to calculate the
       effects of a specific scenario on the schedule--for example, how the schedule will be affected if
       a vendor does not make the delivery of a major component on the promised date. Because a
       "what if " scenario by definition represents uncertainty, this analysis often leads to risk planning,
                 DEVELOPING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE                                 Chapter 5       137


which might include changing the schedule or changing the network diagram to get a few activ-
ities out of harm's way if possible.
As you have seen, the critical path method is used to develop a schedule for given resources,
whereas the critical chain method factors in the uncertainty of the availability of the resources.
The resource leveling technique is used to move the resources around to meet the resource needs
of the activities that must be accomplished on a specific date. In other words, in an ideal world
in which the required (or planned) resources are guaranteed, you do not need the critical chain
method and resource leveling; just the critical path method will do.
Let's assume you have used the critical path method to determine the schedule for a project.
You have also applied other techniques, such as the critical chain method and resource level-
ing. The final realistic schedule that you have come up with has an unacceptable project dura-
tion (the length of the critical path). What do you do? This is where the schedule compression
technique comes to your rescue.


Schedule Compression
It is true that you, the project manager, build the schedule through cold, hard mathematical
analysis and you don't just accept whatever schedule goals come down the pipeline from else-
where, such as from the customer or the project sponsor. However, once you have the sched-
ule built through analysis, you can attempt to accommodate some critical stakeholder
expectations or hard deadlines, such as a predetermined project finish date. I have already dis-
cussed one such method, called resource leveling, to accommodate hard deadlines for activi-
ties. In this section, I will discuss two more methods for schedule compression: crashing and
fast tracking.
Crashing. This is a project schedule compression technique used to decrease the project dura-
tion with minimal additional cost. A number of alternatives are analyzed, including the assign-
ment of additional resources.
Fast tracking. This is a project schedule compression technique used to decrease the project
duration by performing project phases or some schedule activities within a phase in parallel that
would normally be performed in sequence. For example, testing of a product can start when
some of its components are finished, rather than waiting for the whole product to be completed.


             TIP
      Crashing usually involves assigning more resources and hence increasing the cost.
      However, guard yourself against the misconception that additional resources will lin-
      early improve the performance. For example, if one programmer can develop a pro-
      gram in eight days, it does not necessarily mean that two programmers will develop
      the same program in four days, because there will be overheads, such as the initial
      less-productive stage of the newly assigned resource, the time taken to reallocate the
      work, the interaction among the resources, and so on.
138   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       Other Tools and Techniques
       In addition to the main techniques to develop the project schedule, which I already discussed,
       there are some other tools and techniques for developing the project schedule that I will dis-
       cuss in this list.
       Applying calendars. Project calendars and resource calendars must be consulted during the
       schedule development process because they specify when the work can be performed. Project
       calendars can affect all project activities because they, for example, can identify when no work
       can be performed on a site during a certain period of the year. Resource calendars can affect
       project activities that require certain resources or a category of resources because they can
       identify when a resource or a category of resources is not available. The calendar might take
       into account holidays, restrictions on contract workers, overtime issues, other commitments
       within the organization, and the like.
       Adjusting leads and lags. If you applied leads and lags during the activity sequencing process,
       it is time to consider whether you need to adjust those. This adjustment might be necessary to
       create a realistic schedule.
       Project management software. After you have the data for the schedule development created
       by the processes discussed in this chapter, it is a common practice to use project management
       software to build the actual schedule.
       In a nutshell, the main techniques to develop a project schedule include network diagram analy-
       sis (critical path method and critical chain method), schedule compression (fast tracking and
       crashing), and resource leveling. You use these techniques to generate the output of the sched-
       ule development process.


   Output of the Schedule Development Process
       The planned project schedule is an obvious output of the schedule development process. This
       and other output items are discussed in this section.
       Project schedule. The project schedule includes a planned start date and a planned finish date
       for each schedule activity. The schedule will be considered preliminary until the resources have
       been assigned to perform the activities according to the schedule. Although a schedule for a
       simple project might be presented in a tabular form, typically a project schedule is presented
       in one of the following graphical formats:
            Project schedule network diagram. These diagrams present the schedule activities
            on a timescale with a start and finish date for each activity and hence show the
            dependencies of activities on each other.
            Bar chart. In these charts the activities are represented by bars, with each bar show-
            ing the start date, the finish date, and the duration of the activity.
            Milestone chart. These are typically the bar charts representing only the milestones,
            not all the schedule activities.

Schedule model data. This is the supporting data for the project schedule and consists of the
following:
     Schedule activities, schedule milestones, activity attributes, and documentation of all
     identified assumptions and constraints
     Resource requirements by time periods
     Alternative schedules--for example, schedules based on best-case and worst-case
     scenarios
     Schedule contingency reserves
This data is used to create the version of the schedule that is approved by the project manage-
ment team and becomes the schedule baseline.
Schedule baseline. This is a specific version of the project schedule that is approved by the pro-
ject management team as a baseline against which the progress of the project will be measured.
This version of the schedule is developed from the schedule network analysis of the schedule
model data.
Changes and updates. The process of schedule development can generate requests for changes,
which must be processed through the integrated change control process. Furthermore, some
updates may be added to the following items:
     Resource requirements. The schedule development process might change the initial
     estimate for the types and quantities of the required resources.
     Activity attributes. Resource requirements or any other activity attributes that have
     changed must be updated.
     Project calendar. Any update to the project calendar must be documented.
     Project management plan. This plan should include any updates to reflect any
        changes that were realized during the schedule development regarding how the pro-
        ject schedule will be managed. Only the approved changes should be included.


             NOTE
      Project schedule development is an iterative process. For example, it might be neces-
      sary to review and revise the duration and resource estimates for some activities to
      create a project schedule that will be approved. The approved project schedule will
      act as a baseline against which project progress will be tracked.


The approved project schedule is used as a baseline to track the project progress. To some
extent, the schedule development (or modification) continues throughout the project execu-
tion due to the approved changes and the risk occurrences.
140   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       While developing the project schedule, the availability of resources required to perform the
       schedule activities is an obvious assumption. An important category of resources is human
       resources--for example, a computer programmer who will write a computer program.



   Planning Human Resources
       Project roles, responsibilities of the roles, and reporting relationships need to be defined in order
       to perform a project. A role is a defined function to be performed by a team member, such as
       programmer or tester. The other issue that needs to be addressed before the project can be per-
       formed is how and when the project team members (who will perform the project work) will
       be acquired. The human resource planning process addresses these issues.
       Therefore, two main goals of the human resource planning process are the following:
            Identify and document project roles, responsibilities for each role, and reporting rela-
               tionships among the roles.
            Create the staff management plan.
       Figure 5.11 shows the human resource planning process.




           FIGURE 5.11 The human resource planning process: input, tools and techniques, and output


   Input to Human Resource Planning
       Before you can assign the resources to a project, you need to know the resource requirements
       of the project, which are the main input item to the resource planning process. The other two
       input items are the familiar ones: enterprise environmental factors and organizational process
       assets.
                           PLANNING HUMAN RESOURCES                             Chapter 5      141


Enterprise environmental factors. How do the different departments and the people within
the performing organization interact with each other? This will have a profound effect on defin-
ing the roles and responsibilities. Overall, while planning human resources, you must consider
the following enterprise environmental factors:
     Interpersonal. The interpersonal environmental factor should be explored while
     considering the candidates for the project team members. You should seek answers
     to interpersonal questions, such as the following:
      What are the job descriptions of the candidates? This will tell you what kind of
         project activities they might be able to perform.
      What types of formal and informal reporting relationships exist among the can-
         didates?
      What cultural or language differences will possibly affect the working relation-
         ships among the candidates?
     Logistical. The logistical factor deals with the issue of how the project team is
     spread out geographically. For example, a relevant question to ask is, are the team
     members spread out in different buildings, time zones, or countries?
     Organizational. The organizational factor relevant to human resource planning can
     be identified by the answers to the following questions:
      Which departments of the performing organization will participate in the pro-
         ject?
      What are the current relationships between these departments? In other words,
         how do these departments interact?
     Political. To explore the effect of the political factor on human resource planning,
     you should ask questions such as:
         What are the individual goals and agendas of the project stakeholders?
         Which individuals or groups are influential in areas important to the project?
         What are the formal or informal alliances that exist between individuals or
         departments relevant to the project?
     Technical. Almost all projects these days include the use of some kind of technol-
     ogy. To explore the effects of technical factors on human resource planning, you
     should explore answers to questions such as:
      What are the technical specialties, such as software, programming languages, and
         technical equipment, needed to perform the project?
      Which of these specialties need to be coordinated?
      Are there any technical challenges this project might face?
Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets that can be useful in human
resource planning include checklists and templates. Some examples of checklists are common
project roles in your organization, typical competencies, training programs to consider, team
142   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       ground rules, and safety considerations. Examples of templates include project organizational
       charts and standard conflict management approach.
       Project management plan. Following are the components of the project management plan
       relevant to resource planning:
            Activity resource requirements to determine the human resource needs of the project
            Descriptions of project management activities, such as quality assurance and risk
               management, which will help ensure that all the project roles and responsibilities are
               identified
       The activity resource requirements are the raw material to determine the roles that will per-
       form the activities. Various tools and techniques are available to convert some requirements into
       roles.


   Tools and Techniques for Human Resource Planning
       You need resources to complete the activities, and some of these resources will be human
       resources. For example, consider an activity in a project--writing a program. The program will
       be written by a programmer, which is a human resource. However, before you even know the
       name of the programmer, you can work with this programmer as a role and assign a real indi-
       vidual to fill this role later. The tools and techniques used to determine the roles for a project
       are discussed in this section.
       Organizational charts. These charts identify and document the roles of the project team mem-
       bers, the responsibilities assigned to the roles, and the reporting relationships among the roles.
       Most of the chart formats fall into three categories--hierarchical, matrix, and text-oriented.
            Hierarchical. Hierarchical charts are the traditional way to represent the reporting
            relationships in an organization, in a top-down format. Such a chart is also called an
            organizational breakdown structure (OBS), and is arranged according to the organiza-
            tion's existing departments, units, or teams. The OBS will help you to identify team
            members for the project.
            Matrix. A matrix is used to specify the relationships between schedule activities,
            roles, and team members. Such a matrix is generally called a responsibility assignment
            matrix (RAM). Different matrices can show these relationships at different levels.
            For example, you can use the RAM to document resource requirements for each
            activity, as shown in Table 5.3. You can also use a RAM to document the specific
            responsibilities assigned to specific team members for the schedule activities, as
            shown in Table 5.4.
            Text-oriented. When the team-member responsibilities need to be described in
            detail, text-based documents might be more useful. These documents can be known
            by various names in different organizations, such as responsibilities forms, position
            descriptions, and role-responsibility-authority forms. Once established, these documents
            can act as templates for other projects.

Depending upon the project needs, you can use both RAM and text-oriented charts to docu-
ment roles and responsibilities. Also, remember that the RAM can be used for various pur-
poses. For example, the RAM in Table 5.3 documents the resource requirements for the
schedule activities, while the RAM in Table 5.4 depicts the roles of team members for sched-
ule activities.
The RAM in Table 5.4 is also called the RACI chart because it assigns four roles to team mem-
bers for various activities: responsible (R), accountable (A), consult (C), and inform (I). For
example, Deborah has the responsibility of designing the product, Cathleen will be held
accountable for the design, Kiruba will play the role of a consultant for designing the product,
while Anil and Maya will play the role of keeping everybody informed of the status and
progress.
Networking. Burn it in your head: Networking is one of the golden secrets you have for suc-
ceeding as a project manager, especially in an organization in which functional managers hold
all the power (hiring, firing, bonuses), and the project managers are running around with noth-
ing in their hands other than the project schedules and status reports. To network effectively,
you should understand the influence of political and interpersonal factors in your organization
that might impact various staffing management options. Some of the essential networking hap-
pens at the beginning of each project, and you must make full use of it. However, networking
144   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       is a regular practice, and you should be using all the human resource network activities, such as
       proactive correspondence, informal conversations, luncheon meetings, and trade conferences.
       Organizational theories. Various organizational theories provide information and insight on
       how people behave in a team or an organization, what motivates team members, and the like.
       If you have knowledge of these theories, it will help you plan human resources quickly and use
       them more effectively.
       To summarize, organizational charts, networking, and organizational theories are the main
       tools and techniques used to determine roles and develop the staff management plan, which
       are the major output items of the human resource planning process.


   Output of Human Resource Planning
       The output of the human resource planning process includes roles and responsibilities, as well
       as the staff management plan. These and other output items are discussed in this list.
       Roles and responsibilities. The schedule project activities will be completed by individuals
       working in certain roles and performing responsibilities that come with the roles. So, roles and
       responsibilities are an important output of human resource planning. While determining roles
       and responsibilities, you must be clear about the following concepts:
            Role. In real life, most activities are performed by people playing certain roles, such
            as a parent, a teacher, or a student. Similarly, in project management, a role is essen-
            tially a set of responsibilities, such as the responsibilities of a developer, a tester, or a
            manager. A role is assigned to a team member who will perform the responsibilities
            included in the role to complete one or more project activities.
            Responsibility. A responsibility is a piece of work (task) that must be performed as
            part of completing a project activity. Responsibilities can be grouped together as a
            role.
            Competency. Competency is the ability of a team member to play a certain role--
            that is, to perform the responsibilities assigned to the role. While assigning a role to
            a team member, you should know whether the team member possesses the skills
            required to perform the responsibilities of the role. You might need to respond to a
            mismatch with training, hiring, schedule changes, or scope changes.
            Authority. Authority is a right assigned to a role that enables the person playing the
            role to apply project resources, make certain decisions, or sign approvals.


                    TIP
             Roles must be clarified by specifying the responsibilities and the authorities assigned
             to each role. A good match between the levels of responsibility and authority for each
             team member generally produces the best results. This gives the team members a
             sense of ownership.
                          PLANNING HUMAN RESOURCES                            Chapter 5       145


Project organizational charts. A project organizational chart displays the project team mem-
bers and the reporting relationships among them. The level of formality and detail of these
charts depends upon the size and needs of the project at hand.
Staffing management plan. After you have determined the roles to perform the activities, you
need to identify individuals to fill those roles. The staff management plan describes when and
how human resource requirements for a project will be met. When preparing the staff man-
agement plan for your project, you must consider the following items:
     Staff acquisition. While planning staff acquisition, you might need to struggle with
     some of the following questions:
      What are the levels of expertise needed for the project, and what are the assigned
         costs?
      Will the human resources come from within the organization, outside the orga-
         nization, or both?
      Will the team members be required to work in a central location, or can they
         work from distant locations?
      Will you need the assistance of the human resources department of your organi-
         zation to acquire the staff?
     Timetable and release criteria. You need to have a timetable for the human
     resource requirements, describing when and for how long a staff member is needed.
     The project schedule will help you determine that. You should also determine the
     release criteria and time to release each team member from the project. Planning of
     release criteria is very important for a smooth transition of team members from one
     project to another, and for the optimal use of the resources.
     Training needs. If some team members lack the adequate level of skills needed for
     the project, a training plan can be developed as part of the project.
     Compliance and safety. The staff management plan can also include strategies for
     complying with relevant government regulations, union contracts, and human
     resource policies. Your organization might have some policies and procedures that
     protect the team members from safety hazards. These policies and procedures must
     be included in the staff management plan.
     Recognition and rewards. Recognition and rewards are good tools to promote and
     reinforce desired behavior. However, to use this tool effectively, you must have clear
     criteria for rewards based on activities and performance of team members. The
     potential candidate for a reward must have an appropriate level of control over the
     activity for which the reward will be offered. For example, if a team member is to be
     rewarded for completing the project within the budget, the team member must have
     an adequate level of control over the decision-making that affected the spending.
The human resource planning accomplishes two things: It determines roles to perform the
schedule activities, and it develops a staff management plan to fill those roles with team
members.
146   Chapter 5     PLANNING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE


       The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
            Various time management processes are used to produce schedule model data--a list
            of schedule activities and attributes for each activity, such as required resources and
            the duration of the activity.
            The schedule model data is used to develop the project schedule, which is an itera-
            tive process due to the uncertainties in the schedule data and due to the changes
            during the project execution. However, the approved version of the planned schedule
            is used as a baseline to track the project progress.
            The human resource planning process is used to determine roles to perform the
            schedule activities and to develop a staff management plan to fill these roles with
            team members.



   Summary
       Project schedule development is a journey that begins with decomposing the work packages in
       the WBS to project activities and ends with determining resources, including team members
       who will perform those activities at certain times. The schedule planning addresses some basic
       questions: What are the activities that need to be performed to complete the project, who is
       going to perform these activities, and when?
       The activity definition process is used to decompose the work packages in the WBS into sched-
       ule activities. The resulting activity list is used by the activity sequencing process to generate
       network diagrams, which display the dependencies among the activities. Two methods are com-
       monly used to construct network diagrams: the precedence diagramming method (PDM),
       which can be used to display any of the four kinds of dependencies, and the arrow diagram-
       ming method (ADM), which can be used only to show finish-to-start dependencies. The activ-
       ity list and attributes are also used to determine the resource requirements for the project. Given
       the available resource, you can estimate the activity duration--that is, the time it will take to
       perform the activity.
       By using various time-management processes discussed in this chapter, you identify schedule
       activities, arrange them in proper sequence, determine resource requirements for them, and esti-
       mate their durations. All these tasks and accomplishments are a means to an end called project
       schedule development. You typically use the critical path method to develop the project sched-
       ule from a network diagram. After you have a schedule, you can use schedule compression
       methods, such as fast tracking and crashing, to accommodate hard deadlines. Schedule devel-
       opment is an iterative process that can continue well into the project execution due to approved
       changes and risk occurrences. However, the approved planned project schedule is used as a base-
       line to track the project progress.
       The human resource planning process is used to determine roles to perform the activities in
       the project schedule and to develop a staff management plan to fill these roles with team
       members. When the project starts executing, it needs to be monitored, which is the topic of
       the next chapter.
                                                              SUMMARY                  Chapter 5     147


Exam's Eye View
Comprehend

 The major task of the activity definition process is to generate the activity list (output) by
    decomposing the work packages of the WBS (input) into activities.

 The major task of the activity sequencing process is to determine the dependencies among the
    activities in the activity list (input) and display those dependencies in the network diagrams
    (output).

 After the activity resource requirements have been determined, the duration for an activity can
    be estimated for a given resource.

 The approved project schedule acts as a baseline against which the project progress is tracked.
 The human resource planning process is used to determine roles to perform the schedule
    activities and to develop the staff management plan to fill the roles with team members.

Look Out

 Activity duration is estimated for a given resource. Changing the quantity of the resource will
    change the duration estimate.

 Activity duration measured in work periods does not include holidays, whereas the duration
    measured in calendar units does. For example, the activity duration from Friday to the follow-
    ing Tuesday is three days when measured in work units and five days when measured in calen-
    dar units, given that no work is done on Saturday and Sunday.

 Each activity on a critical path has zero float time and thus poses a schedule risk. Therefore,
    you must monitor the activities on all critical paths very closely during the execution of the
    project.

Memorize

 The activity list, generated as an output of the activity definition process, becomes a compo-
    nent of the project management plan.

 In PDM, finish-to-start is the most commonly used dependency relationship, whereas ADM
    only uses finish-to-start dependency.

 Fast tracking compresses the schedule by performing activities simultaneously that would oth-
    erwise be performed in sequence, whereas crashing compresses the schedule by assigning more
    resources.

Introduction
  After a project has been planned using the processes in the planning process group, it needs to
  be executed using the processes in the executing process group. The project team determines
  which of the processes in the executing process group is relevant to the project at hand. The
  goal of the execution stage is to complete the project work specified in the project manage-
  ment plan to meet the project requirements. To accomplish that, you will need to acquire,
  develop, and manage the project team. Your organization might not have the resources to fin-
  ish certain parts of this work. You will need to use procurement for those parts of the work.
  You also need to ensure that all the planned quality activities are performed. This is accom-
  plished by using the quality assurance process.
  So the core question in this chapter is how to execute a project as planned. In search of
  an answer, you will explore three avenues--performing the project work by acquiring, devel-
  oping, and managing the project team; implementing procurement; and performing quality
  assurance.



Executing a Project
  The project work defined in the project management plan is executed by using the processes
  in the executing process group, shown in Figure 6.1. It is up to the project team to determine
  which of these processes is relevant for the project at hand. The processes in this group are
  used to accomplish the following:
          Coordinate people and resources
          Integrate and perform project activities
          Implement the project scope
          Implement the approved changes
  The following list defines the processes shown in Figure 6.1:
       Direct and manage project execution. Process to manage various interfaces in the
       project to execute the project work smoothly.
       Acquire the project team. Process to obtain the project team members needed to
       perform the project work.
       Develop the project team. Process to improve the interaction among team members
       to enhance the project performance.
158   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT




          FIGURE 6.1 The processes used in executing a project. All of these processes (except the manage
                         project team process) belong to the executing process group.

            Manage the project team. Process to manage the project team, which includes
               tracking the performance of team members, providing feedback, resolving issues, and
               coordinating changes to improve project performance.
            Perform quality assurance. Process to implement the planned quality activities so
               that the project meets all the requirements.
            Distribute information. Process to keep the project stakeholders informed about
               the project progress in a timely manner.
            Request seller responses. Process to obtain responses in terms of quotations, bids,
               offers, and proposals from sellers outside the project team for their products or ser-
               vices needed for the project.
            Select seller responses. Process to select sellers based on their responses and to
               negotiate written contracts with the selected sellers.
       Once the project execution starts, it needs to be managed, which is accomplished using the
       direct and manage execution process.
   DIRECTING AND MANAGING PROJECT EXECUTION                                           Chapter 6   159


Directing and Managing
Project Execution
  The project work defined in the project management plan is performed using the direct and
  manage process. While executing this process, you will be interacting with other processes and
  departments in your organization. In general, a project team includes people from different
  departments. Usually the reporting relationships within the same department are very well-
  defined and structured. However, the relationships between different departments (especially
  between individuals from different departments at the same level of authority) are not well-
  defined. So, managing such project interfaces is a crucial function of a project manager during
  project execution. Generally speaking, project interfaces are the formal and informal bound-
  aries and relationships among team members, departments, organizations, or functions--for
  example, how the development department and the QA department interact with each other
  while working on the same project. Directing and managing project execution is the process
  used to manage various technical and organizational interfaces in the project to facilitate
  smooth execution of the project work.
  The main purposes of directing and managing project execution are
          Producing the project deliverables by executing the project management plan
          Implementing the approved changes, defect repairs, and other actions
          Implementing the planned methods, processes, and standards
          Producing and distributing the status information
  The key words during execution are implement, manage, and inform (status). Figure 6.2 shows
  the direct and manage project execution process with its input, tools and techniques, and output.

                    and output
160   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


   Input to Directing and Managing Project Execution
       The input to directing and managing project execution mainly consists of the items that need
       to be implemented. The information on the project work that needs to be performed to pro-
       duce project deliverables is the major input to this process. The specific input items are dis-
       cussed in the following list:
       Project management plan. The project management plan contains all the major subsidiary
       plans, such as the project scope management plan, the schedule baseline, the cost baseline, and
       the quality baseline. It describes how the work will be executed to meet the project objectives
       and produce deliverables.
       Approved items. The following approved items are input to the project execution because
       they must be implemented.
            Change requests. The approved requests for changes to the project schedule, scope,
            cost, policies, procedures, and project management plan need to be implemented,
            and therefore are the input to the execution process. These change requests are
            scheduled for execution by the project management team.
            Defect repairs. This is the list of the defects found during the quality assurance
            (QA) process that have been approved for repairs.
            Corrective actions. The QA process can recommend corrective actions to improve
            quality, which are directions for executing the project work to bring expected project
            performance into conformance with the project management plan. The approved
            corrective actions must be scheduled for implementation.
            Preventive actions. These are the directions to perform an activity that will reduce
            the probability of negative consequences associated with project risks. These preven-
            tive actions are recommended by the QA process during process analysis.
       Validated defect repairs. This is a list with information on whether a previously performed
       defect repair has been accepted or rejected. This will tell you whether you need to implement
       the defect repair again.
       Administrative closure procedure. This procedure describes how to properly close a can-
       celled or completed project. You might need to perform some work during the project execu-
       tion (such as creating some documents to archive information) that is required for the closure
       procedure. Therefore, you must consult this procedure during the project execution.
       There are mainly three kinds of items that need to be implemented and therefore are input to
       the direct and manage project execution process: the original deliverables, the approved
       changes, and defects. You direct and manage the execution by using some tools, which will be
       discussed in the next section.
    DIRECTING AND MANAGING PROJECT EXECUTION                                        Chapter 6        161


Tools and Techniques for Directing and
Managing Project Execution
   Project execution includes the execution of the project management plan. Each organization
   might have a different method to execute the project management plan, called a project man-
   agement methodology. Also, to manage the execution you might use a set of tools and tech-
   niques called the project management information system. So, project management methodology
   and the project management information system are the two main tools and techniques for the
   direct and manage project execution process.
   Project management methodology. The project management plan contains the output of the
   project planning processes. This plan defines how the project is executed, monitored/controlled,
   and closed. But how do we implement (that is, execute) the project management plan? Every
   organization will have its own method to implement the project management plan for its pro-
   jects, called a project management methodology. This is a high-level method on top of the pro-
   ject management processes. In other words, project management methodology defines a process
   that helps the project team in executing the project management plan.
   Project management information system. This is a collection of tools and techniques--man-
   ual and automated--used to gather, integrate, and disseminate the output of project manage-
   ment processes. This system is used to facilitate processes from the initiation stage all the way
   to the closing stage. Microsoft Project, a product that lets you create a project schedule, is an
   example of such a tool.
   The project is executed to produce some results, which will be the output of directing and man-
   aging the execution.


Output of Directing and Managing Project Execution
   When the project is being executed, at each point in time there are some deliverables com-
   pleted and there is a status for the project that can be reported to the stakeholders. These two
   important output items, along with others, are discussed in this section.
   Deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and identifiable product, service, or result identified in
   the project management plan that must be executed to complete the project. The main pur-
   pose of executing the project management plan is to produce deliverables.
   Change requests. During the execution of the project work, requests for changes in the fol-
   lowing areas might arise:
           Project scope
           Project cost
           Project schedule
           Policies or procedures
162   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       These change requests might come from inside or outside the performing organization and can
       be optional or mandated legally or contractually. These change requests must be approved
       before they can be processed and implemented.
       Implemented items. When you are directing and managing the project execution, obviously
       the items are being implemented. In addition to the work that produces original deliverables,
       the following items are implemented during project execution:
               Approved change requests
               Approved corrective actions recommended by the QA process
               Approved preventive actions recommended by the QA process
               Approved defect repairs recommended by the QA process
       Work performance information. Monitoring the project status is one of the crucial functions
       of a project manager during project execution. Work performance information is basically the
       project status information that is regularly collected and distributed among the stakeholders.
       It includes the following items:
            The schedule progress information:
             Schedule activities that have been finished and those that have started
             Estimate to complete the schedule activities that have started and hence are in
                  progress
                The portion of each in-progress activity completed in a percentage--for exam-
                  ple, activity A is 30% complete
                Deliverables that have been completed and those that have not yet been completed
               Incurred costs compared to authorized costs
               Resource utilization details
               How well the quality standards are being met
               Lessons learned and added to the knowledge base
       The main output of the direct and manage project execution process are the project deliver-
       ables specified in the project management plan. Between planning the project and producing
       the deliverables, many things need to happen, and you need processes for them too. Therefore,
       the direct and manage project execution process is a high-level process, and to execute it you
       need to perform some other processes too, which are discussed in this chapter. To start with,
       you need to put together a project team.



   Acquiring a Project Team
       The project work will be executed by the project team, and therefore the role of the team in
       the success of the project is crucial. Therefore, it is critical to acquire the right project team for
       your project. You accomplish this through the acquire project team process, shown in Figure
       6.3. Roles and responsibilities for the roles required to complete the project are defined during
                                  ACQUIRING A PROJECT TEAM                             Chapter 6   163




       FIGURE 6.3 The acquire project team process: input, tools and techniques, and output

   the human resource planning process, discussed in the previous chapter. Before the work can
   start, the roles need to be assigned to real individuals who will become the members of the
   project team. These individuals might comes from different departments, and the project
   management team might have no direct control over them. So, these team members need to
   be acquired through a process like the one shown in Figure 6.3.
   The major input to the acquire team process comes from the human resource planning dis-
   cussed in the previous chapter.


Input to Acquiring the Project Team
   The human resource planning process generates the output that contains the staffing manage-
   ment plan, the project organizational chart, and the roles and responsibilities. These items are
   major inputs into the process of acquiring a project team. These and other input items are dis-
   cussed in this section.
   Enterprise environmental factors. The enterprise environmental factors are important in
   obtaining the project team members because the team members can come from various sources
   inside and outside the performing organization. For example, the team might include current
   employees of the performing organization and contractors hired for the project. Depending on
   your enterprise environment, you, the project manager (or the project management team), may
   or may not be able to direct or influence the hiring and staff assignments. In either case, you
   must try to obtain the best team you can. To determine who will be the best team, you need
   to do your homework, which includes finding out the availability and abilities of the candidate
   team members.
164   Chapter 6      EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       When you do have an influence on making the staff assignments, you should consider the fol-
       lowing characteristics:
            Availability. It is important to know whether and when the candidate is available
                before you attempt to obtain that member.
                Competency. Does the candidate have the skills needed to complete the schedule
                activities?
                Experience. Has the candidate performed similar work well in the past?
                Interests. What is the candidate's interest level in this project and in the work that
                will be assigned to him or her?
                Cost. What is the cost attached to each candidate in terms of pay? This is even
                more important if the member is a contractor.
       Based on this information, build your dream team on paper and attempt to obtain that team.
       If the team is spread out over different departments and hence the team members are under
       the control of different functional managers, plan who you will ask for from each functional
       manager. To make a request, meet with the manager and ask for your most wanted team mem-
       ber first, even though it is very unlikely that you will get everyone you ask for. Before meeting
       the functional managers, you need to prioritize your staffing needs. The most complex activi-
       ties and the activities on the critical paths should get special attention, and you should make
       sure these activities have the best members because they have the highest risk potential. Hav-
       ing assigned staff to these activities first, you have more flexibility to agree to a different resource
       assigned to activities that are less complex and have a non-zero float time. Even though you
       want to negotiate for the best team, keep a backup plan--that is, if you don't get the best
       member, try to get the second best member, and so on.


                     NOTE
             In a traditional organizational structure, you will not have direct control over the pro-
             ject team members, and you will need to acquire them by negotiating with the func-
             tional managers. But you still need to do the homework that you would do if you were
             to interview the candidates because you still want to get the best members available
             for the job.


       Organizational process assets. In the process of acquiring the project team, you should con-
       sider the following organizational process assets:
            Guidelines, policies, or procedures governing staff assignments that your organiza-
            tion may have
            Help from the human resources department in recruitment of and orientation for
            the team members
                                 ACQUIRING A PROJECT TEAM                           Chapter 6        165


   Roles and responsibilities. Roles with specific responsibilities are defined in the human
   resource planning process based on the project work that needs to be performed. These roles
   will be the guide to finding suitable candidates for the project team, because the team mem-
   bers will play these roles.
   Project organizational chart. This chart gives you a quick overview of the number of team
   members needed and their relationships to each other.
   Staffing management plan. A staffing management plan is an important input item to acquir-
   ing the project team because it provides detailed information about the roles that need to be
   filled, such as the start and finish dates for a role. This information is necessary to match the
   candidates with the roles.



                TIP
         In the worst case scenario, you will not be able to negotiate for staff and you will have
         no influence on the staff assignments. Unless a team member is not qualified to do the
         job, you will have to live with the staff assignment decision and make the best of it. If
         you choose to challenge one of these assignments, make sure you are doing this based
         on hard facts, such as the lack of skills required to perform the assigned activity.


   To put together the best team, you need to understand the tools and techniques available for
   acquiring the team.


Tools and Techniques for Acquiring the Project Team
   You will either negotiate with the functional manager for a team member to fill a role, or you
   will acquire the team member from outside your organization, such as a contractor. Negotia-
   tion and acquisition are discussed in this section, along with other tools and techniques.
   Acquisition. If the performing organization does not have the human resources to fill one or
   more roles needed to finish the project, the required team member can be obtained from out-
   side the organization as a contractor, or the corresponding work can be given to the source
   outside the performing organization. We will talk more about this area of procurement man-
   agement later in this chapter.
   Negotiation. You will most likely need to negotiate with functional managers for the staff
   assignments for your project. In these negotiations, you have a two-prong goal--to obtain the
   best available person for an activity and to obtain the person for the required timeframe. As
   described in the previous section, you must do your homework in order to get the best results
   from the negotiations.
166   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT




                   TIP
             While negotiating with a functional manager, sometimes it's important to understand
             the functional manager's perspective in light of the politics of the organization. For
             example, a functional manager will weigh the benefits (for example, visibility of your
             project compared to that of competing projects) in determining where to assign the
             best performers. In this case, it is to your advantage to explain the importance of your
             project and the activity for which you are asking for the best performer.


       Pre-assignment. In some cases, there will be some staff members already assigned to the pro-
       ject. This can happen, for example, due to the following situations:
            A staff member was promised as part of a specific proposal to compete with another
            proposal. Acceptance of this proposal automatically affirms that staff-member
            assignment.
            There is only one person in the organization who has the expertise to perform a spe-
            cific activity.
            A staff assignment was specified in the project charter.
       Virtual teams. Welcome to the information age triggered by the Internet. The process of work-
       ing for an organization from outside its physical location is called telecommuting. The Internet
       (along with other technological advances, such as teleconferencing, cellular phones, and pagers)
       makes it possible to telecommute from your home in the same city where the organization is
       or from a location on the other side of the globe with almost the same ease. Teams composed
       of telecommuters are called virtual teams because the team works together on the same project
       without holding face-to-face meetings. It is not difficult to find people who have worked on
       virtual teams and have never seen the other team members face to face. I have worked on sev-
       eral such teams, and I'm sure you either have or you will in the near future. The virtual team
       format expands the team definition to offer the following benefits:
            People working for the same organization but living in different locations can join
               the same team.
            A needed expert can join a team even if the expert does not live in the same location
            as the rest of the team.
            The organization has the option to accommodate employees who can only work
            from their home offices for a certain period of time.
            Due to the availability of asynchronous communication means, such as e-mail and
            online bulletin boards, it is possible to form a team of members who have different
            work hours or shifts.
            Virtual teams eliminate or reduce the need to travel by using means of communica-
            tion that are abundantly available, such as e-mail, video conferencing, and the World
            Wide Web. This enables organizations to perform projects that were previously
            impossible due to the anticipated travel expenses.
                           DEVELOPING THE PROJECT TEAM                             Chapter 6      167


   Note that because the virtual team members are not at the same location and do not have reg-
   ular face-to-face meetings, the effective communication is that much more important for the
   success of the project being performed by the virtual team. Therefore, communication man-
   agement is crucial to the success of virtual teams.
   The team you are going to acquire could be a team at one location or a virtual team, and a
   team member might be from your organization or from outside your organization. Whatever
   the case may be, the team itself is the major output of the acquire team process--no surprise
   there.


Output of Acquiring the Project Team
   The major output of the acquire project team process are the staff assignments to fill the roles
   defined during human resource planning and the list of time periods for which the staff mem-
   bers will be available. These and other output items are discussed in the following list.
        Project staff assignments. This document contains the list of individuals assigned to
        the project. It can also include the memos sent to the team members, the project
        organization chart, and the schedule with the names inserted.
        Resource availability. This document includes the time periods for which each
        assigned member can work on the project. Possible schedule conflicts, commitments
        to other projects, and times when a team member is not available can also be recorded.
        Updates to the staffing management plan. The project team is acquired by match-
        ing the staffing requirements specified in the staffing management plan to the can-
        didates. Hardly ever is there a perfect match between the two. During the process of
        acquiring the project team, you might realize that the staffing management plan
        needs to be updated. The other updates to the staffing management plan might
        come from the following sources:
         Promotions
         Retirements
         Illnesses
         Performance issues
         Changing workloads
   After the staff assignments have been made, you have the raw material out of which you need
   to develop the special team for your project.



Developing the Project Team
   Your project team can consist of members from different departments and disciplines, regular
   employees and contractors, and experts from different disciplines. Some of these individuals
   might not have much appreciation for others' disciplines. You have a challenge to develop this
168   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       diverse group into a cohesive and efficient team that will perform the project on time, within
       budget, and with quality. There are two major goals for team development:
            Improve the competencies of team members
            Improve the interaction among team members
       This will help you develop a cohesive and competent team to meet the project objectives effec-
       tively.
       As Figure 6.4 shows, the output of the acquire project team process is the input to the develop
       project team process. The team development starts with a list of team members and the staff
       assignments made during the acquire project team process. The resource availability list pro-
       vides information about when the team members are available for the team development activ-
       ities. The following items of the staff management plan can be useful for team development:
            Training strategies
            Plans for developing the project team
            Recognition and rewards systems




           FIGURE 6.4 The develop project team process: input, tools and techniques, and output

       As discussed in the following list, there are some standard tools and techniques that you can
       use to develop a winning team.
       General management skills. You and the project management team can minimize problems
       and maximize cooperation by understanding the sentiments of each team member, anticipat-
       ing their actions, acknowledging their concerns, and following up on their issues. To accom-
       plish this, the following interpersonal management skills are necessary:
            Effective communication. This is needed to facilitate the smooth flow of necessary
               information among the team members.
                         DEVELOPING THE PROJECT TEAM                              Chapter 6       169


     Ability to influence the organization. This is needed to get things done.
     Leadership. This is needed for developing a vision and strategy and for motivating
     people to achieve that vision. During the time of possible uncertainty, such as
     changes in upper management, you should clarify the situation and help the team
     stay focused on the project.
     Motivation. This is needed for energizing team members to achieve high levels of
     performance and to overcome barriers to change. During the times when the team is
     in a low-morale mode, you should be able to lift the team morale and thereby con-
     tribute to team development.
     Negotiation and conflict management. This is needed to work with the team
     members to resolve their conflicts and facilitate negotiations when necessary in
     resolving conflicts or in task assignments. Depending on the nature of the conflict,
     you can take it as a team development opportunity. An effective resolution of a con-
     flict contributes to team building.
     Problem solving. This ability is needed to define, analyze, and solve problems.
Team management is further discussed later in this chapter.
Ground rules. A very important management technique is to establish clear expectations at
the very beginning of a project. The expectations can be established by establishing a set of
ground rules. Early commitment to these guidelines will increase cooperation and productiv-
ity by decreasing misunderstandings.
Team-building activities. Team-building activities can range from indirect team-building
activities, such as participating in constructing the WBS, to direct team-building activities, such
as social gatherings where the team members can get to know each other and start feeling
comfortable with each other. While planning such activities, you should keep in mind that the
team members might have different interests and different levels of tolerance for games and
different icebreakers.
The project kickoff meeting is another indirect method to start team development. This can
be used as a formal way to introduce team members and other stakeholders and spell out the
project goals for everyone at the same time. An ideal kickoff meeting is a combination of seri-
ous business and fun. The goal is to align the team with the project goals and to help the team
members feel comfortable with each other.
In planning the kickoff meeting, you can assume that team members have the following ques-
tions in their heads that need to be answered before the end of the meeting:
        Why am I here?
        Who are you and what are your expectations of me?
        What is this team going to do?
        How is the team going to do its work?
        How do I fit into all this?
170   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       Consider the following steps to make your kickoff meeting successful:
            Agenda. Putting the meeting agenda in the hands of the team members always
               helps to run the meeting more smoothly and effectively and keep it on track.
               Welcome. Take immediate charge of the meeting by introducing yourself and wel-
               coming the participants. Quickly walk through the agenda and set the stage for the
               rest of the meeting.
               Project overview. Define the project, its goals, and its deliverables. Introduce the pro-
               ject team members and briefly describe their roles. The goal is to provide a big picture
               and to help individual team members figure out how they fit into the big picture.
               Expectations. Many of the project team members might not already know you and
               your management style. You should take this opportunity to set expectations about
               how the team will function. For example, state that you expect all team members to
               attend the weekly status meetings. Remind the team to focus on the project goal, to
               do their part, and to look out for one another in a team spirit.
               Guest speakers. Depending upon the size and the visibility of the project, you
               might also invite relevant guest speakers, such as the project sponsor, the customer,
               or an executive stakeholder. Before the meeting, spend some time communicating
               with the guest speaker about the message to deliver.
               Closure. Ask for feedback and hold the question-and-answer session before closing
               the meeting.
       Remember that the main purpose of the kickoff meeting is to bring every team member onto
       the same page regarding the big picture of the project. Don't get bogged down discussing every
       item in detail.
       You should know that team development is not an instant process. Generally speaking, when
       you form a team it goes through five stages of development (according to the Tuckman model),
       as shown in Figure 6.5 and explained in the following list.
            Forming. This is the orientation stage, with high dependence on the leader (the
            project manager, in this case) for guidance and direction. Individual roles and
            responsibilities are unclear, and there is little agreement on the team goals other than
            those received from the leader. Processes are often ignored, and the team members
            test the tolerance of the system and the leader. It's time to establish the ground rules
            and clear expectations. The leader directs in this stage.
            Storming. This stage represents the struggle for control and power as team mem-
            bers work to establish themselves relative to other team members. The clarity of
            team goals increases, but some uncertainties persist. Compromises might be required
            to make progress. Coaching and training can play effective roles during this stage.
            Norming. This is the routine stage during which the consensus and agreement
            about team goals generally prevails among the team members. Roles and responsibil-
            ities are clear and accepted by the team members. Major decisions are made by
            group agreements, and smaller decisions can be delegated to the appropriate team
            members. During this stage, the leader facilitates.
                        DEVELOPING THE PROJECT TEAM                             Chapter 6     171




    FIGURE 6.5 The five progressive stages of team development in the Tuckman model

     Performing. This is the productivity stage in which the team knows what it's doing
     and why. The team is functioning in a cohesive mode and working toward the com-
     mon goal in a more autonomous fashion. Disagreements might arise, but they are
     resolved within the team in a constructive way. During this stage, the leader dele-
     gates and oversees.
     Adjourning. This is the closure stage. When the mission for which the team was
     formed is accomplished (or cancelled), the team is adjourned to free the team mem-
     bers to move on to other things.
Being aware of these stages of team development will help you to better understand the behav-
iors of the team members and thereby develop your team more effectively.
Training. The goal of training is to improve the competencies of the project team members,
which in turn helps in meeting the project objectives. It might be aimed at the individual mem-
bers or at the team as a whole, depending upon the needs. The training might be scheduled in
the staff management plan or it might result from the observations, conversations, and project
performance appraisals as the project progresses. Following are examples of some training
methods:
        Coaching
        Mentoring
        On-the-job training of a team member by another team member
        Online training
        Instructor-led classroom training
Co-location. This technique keeps all (or most) of the project team members in the same phys-
ical location to improve communication and to create a sense of community among the team
members. In this age of virtual teams, this is not an increasingly popular technique, but when
most of the team members are in the same location, this technique is a default choice. It can
include a war room, which is a meeting room used for regular face-to-face meetings.
172   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       Recognition and rewards. The recognition and rewards strategy set up during the human
       resource planning process can be used to develop the project team. Remember the following
       rules in setting up a fair reward system:
            Only desirable behavior should be rewarded.
            Any member should be able to win the reward.
            Win-lose rewards, such as team member of the month, can hurt the team cohesive-
               ness.
            The cultural diversity of the team should be considered and respected.
       The effects of the team development efforts are measured by the team performance assessment,
       which includes the following indicators:
            Improvement in individual skills that enables a team member to perform project
            activities more efficiently
            Improvement in team skills that help the team to improve overall performance and
            work more effectively as a group
            Reduced staff turnover rate
       The project team needs to be managed throughout the project. Managing the team is part of
       controlling the project, a topic discussed in the next chapter. However, I will discuss manag-
       ing the team in this chapter for sake of flow.



   Managing the Project Team
       You manage the project team by using the manage project team process, which is aimed at
       improving the project performance by executing the following tasks:
               Resolving issues
               Coordinating changes
               Tracking the performance of each team member
               Providing feedback to the team members
       Figure 6.6 depicts the manage project team process.


                   NOTE
            The manage project team process belongs to the monitoring and controlling process
            group, whereas all other processes discussed in this chapter belong to the executing
            process group.

       FIGURE 6.6 The manage project team process: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input to Managing the Project Team
   The main input to managing the project team comes from the output of the human resource
   planning, acquire project team, and develop project team processes.
   Output from human resource planning. The following output items from the human resource
   planning process are the input to the manage project team process:
        Roles and responsibilities. Used to monitor and evaluate performance.
        Project organizational charts. Used to find out the reporting relationships among
        project team members.
        Staffing management plan. Contains information such as training plans, compli-
        ance issues, and certification requirements, along with the time periods when the
        team members are expected to work.
   Performance information. The following items regarding performance are the input to the
   manage project team process:
        Team performance assessment. This is the output of the develop project team
          process discussed earlier in this chapter.
        Performance reports. Performance reports contain the progress of the project
          against the baseline data, such as the schedule baseline, the cost baseline, and the
          quality baseline. They basically reflect how the project resources are being used to
174   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


            achieve the project objectives. The information from the performance reports helps
            determine future human resource requirements, updates to the staffing management
            plan, and recognitions and rewards.
            Work performance information. This is an output item from the direct and man-
            age project execution process discussed earlier in this chapter. It involves observing
            the performance of each team member, which includes participating in meetings,
            following up on action items, effectively performing the assigned activities, and com-
            municating clearly.
       Organizational process assets. The project management team can use the following organi-
       zation assets in managing the project team:
            The organization's policies, procedures, and system for rewarding the team members
            Other items that should be available to the project management team for use in
              managing the team, such as organizational recognition dinners, certificates of appre-
              ciation, bulletin boards, newsletters, and internal Web sites for information sharing
       To manage the team effectively, you should be aware of the tools and techniques that can be
       used for that.


   Tools and Techniques for Managing the Project Team
       The tools and techniques used in managing the team include observation and conversation,
       conflict management, an issue log, and project performance appraisals.
       Observation and conversation. Observations and conversations are both means to stay in
       touch with the work and attitudes of the project team members. The indicators to monitor
       these include the following:
            Progress toward completion of assigned activities and therefore project deliverables
            Distinguished accomplishments contributing to the project performance
            Interpersonal issues
       Conflict management. The purpose of conflict management is to nourish the positive work-
       ing relationships among the team members that result in increased productivity. The common
       sources for conflicts include the following:
              Scarce resources resulting in unsatisfied needs
              Scheduling priorities
              Personal work styles
              Perceptions, values, feelings, and emotions
              Power struggles
       You can reduce the number of conflicts by setting ground rules, clearly defining roles and
       goals, and implementing solid project management practices.
                            MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                            Chapter 6          175



             TIP
      Differences of opinions should not be considered as sources of conflict. If managed
      properly, differences can be very healthy and can lead to better solutions and thereby
      increase productivity.


Initially, the project team members who are parties to a conflict should be given the opportu-
nity to resolve it themselves. If the team members fail to resolve the conflict and it becomes a
negative factor for the project, you, the project manager, should facilitate the conflict resolu-
tion, usually in private and using a direct and collaborative approach. If the conflict continues,
you might have no option other than to use formal procedures, such as disciplinary actions.
The first step in conflict management is analyzing the nature and type of conflict, which
might involve asking questions. You can meet with (interview) the parties involved in the con-
flict. The next step is to determine the management strategy. Different management strategies
are summarized here:
     Avoidance. In this strategy, at least one party to the conflict ignores (or withdraws)
     from the conflict and decides not to deal with the problem. This strategy can be
     used by the project manager as a cooling-off period, to collect more information, or
     when the issue is not critical. However, if the issue is critical, this is the worst resolu-
     tion strategy and can give rise to lose/lose situations if both parties withdraw or
     yield/lose situations if one party withdraws. This strategy is also called withdrawal
     strategy.
     Competition. In this approach, one party uses any available means to get its way,
     often at the expense of the other party. This is a win/lose situation. It can be justi-
     fied under some situations, such as when the basic rights of a party in conflict are
     at stake or when you want to set a precedent. However, if used unfairly from a
     power position (such as if it is a management style), it can be destructive for team
     development. This strategy can cause the conflict to escalate, and the losing party
     might attempt to retaliate. When used by a party in power, competition is also
     called forcing.
     Compromising. In this strategy, both parties gain something and give up some-
     thing. This is a lose-win/lose-win strategy. You can use this strategy to achieve tem-
     porary solutions and to avoid a damaging power struggle when there is a time
     pressure. The downside of this approach is that both parties can look at the solution
     as a lose/lose situation and can be distracted from the merits of the issues involved.
     In this way, this short-term solution can hurt the long-term objectives of the project.
     Accommodation. This strategy is opposite of the competition strategy. One party
     attempts to meet other party's needs at the expense of their own. This might be a
176   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT


            justifiable strategy when the concerns of the accommodating party are less signifi-
            cant than the concerns of the other party in the context of the project. Sometimes
            it's used as a goodwill gesture. However, it is a lose/win approach (the accommodat-
            ing party loses and the accommodated party wins), and the accommodating party
            runs the risk of losing credibility and influence in the future.
            Collaboration. This strategy is based on reaching consensus among the parties in
            the conflict. Both parties work together to explore several solutions and agree on the
            one that satisfies the needs and concerns of both parties. This is a win/win strategy
            and is generally considered the best of all the strategies because it helps build com-
            mitment and promotes goodwill between the parties involved.



                    TIP
             You should always look for how the different processes overlap and interact with each
             other. For example, conflict management is a technique for managing the team. How-
             ever, the purpose of conflict management is to nourish the positive working relation-
             ships among the team members that result in increased productivity, so resolving a
             conflict can also be looked upon as a team development activity.


       Issue log. Issues generally involve obstacles that can stop the project team from achieving the
       project objectives. A written log should be maintained that contains the list of team members
       responsible for resolving the issues by target dates. The purpose of the issue log is to monitor
       the issues until they are closed.
       Project performance appraisals. Conducting project performance appraisals includes evaluat-
       ing the performance of the project team members and providing them with feedback based on
       the evaluation. The evaluation is based on information collected from several people interact-
       ing with the team member. This method of collecting information is called the 360-degree
       feedback principle because the information comes from several sources.
       The objectives for conducting performance appraisals include the following:
               Providing positive feedback to team members in a possibly hectic environment
               Clarifying roles and responsibilities
               Discovering new issues and reminding of unresolved issues
               Discovering the needs of individual training plans
               Setting specific goals for the future
       While you are managing the team using these techniques, you might recommend some actions
       as an output of the manage project team process.
                              MANAGING THE PROJECT TEAM                           Chapter 6          177



               TIP
        You might find that the project managers in your organization are not responsible for
        performance appraisals. The need for formal or informal performance appraisals
        depends on the organization's policy, the contract requirements, and the size and
        complexity of the project.



Output of Managing the Project Team
   The output from managing the project team includes recommended corrective and preventive
   actions, change requests, and updates to organization process assets and the project manage-
   ment plan.
   Recommended actions. The manage project team process might generate recommendations
   for corrective and preventive actions, as discussed here:
        Recommended corrective actions. A corrective action is a direction for executing
           the project work to bring the future performance in line with what is expected in the
           project management plan. The corrective actions recommended during project team
           management might include the following:
            Staffing changes, such as changing assignments of the team members, replacing
               team members (for example, the ones who leave), and outsourcing some work
            Training for the team or for individual team members
            Recognition and rewards based on the reward system
            Disciplinary actions
        Recommended preventive actions. A preventive action is a direction to perform an
           activity to stop or reduce the probability of an anticipated event occurrence generally
           associated with a project risk. Preventive action can also be taken to reduce the
           anticipated impact of an event in case it happens. The preventive actions recom-
           mended during project team management might include the following:
            Cross-training so that in the absence of a team member, another team member
               can take over the assignment
            Role clarifications to ensure that all the responsibilities associated with the role
               are performed
            Planning for overtime in anticipation of extra work that might be needed to
               meet project deadlines
178   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       Change requests and updates. Managing the project team can generate the change requests
       and updates discussed here:
            Change requests. The team management activities can generate some change
            requests for the project management plan. For example, staffing changes can gener-
            ate requests for extending the schedule, increasing the budget, or reducing the scope.
            The change requests should be processed through the integrated change control sys-
            tem.
            Updates to organizational process assets. Two kinds of organizational process assets
            can be updated as a result of project team management:
             Performance appraisals. The project staff member that interacts with a project
                team member in a significant way can offer input to the performance appraisal
                for that team member.
             Lessons-learned database. The lessons-learned database should be updated with
                the lessons learned during team management, which can come from different
                areas that include the following:
                 Issues and solutions in the issue log
                 Special skills and competencies discovered during the project work for the
                    team members
                 Successful and unsuccessful ground rules, conflict management techniques,
                    and recognition events
            Updates to the project management plan. Approved change requests and corrective
            actions can result in updates to the staffing management plan, which is a part of the
            project management plan. New role assignments, training plans, and reward deci-
            sions are some examples of updates.
       In addition to performing the project work to produce the project deliverables, a significant
       task to perform during project execution is quality assurance.



                   TIP
            Managing the project team is a complex task when the team members are accountable
            to both the project managers and the functional managers--for example, in a matrix
            organization. Effectively managing this dual relationship is critical to the success of the
            project and is therefore generally the responsibility of the project manager.
                       PERFORMING QUALITY ASSURANCE                                  Chapter 6    179


Performing Quality Assurance
  Quality planning, discussed in Chapter 4, is used to identify which quality standards are rele-
  vant to the project at hand and to determine how to meet these standards. Implementing qual-
  ity management consists of the following two components:
       Quality assurance (QA). Quality assurance is the application of the planned sys-
       tematic quality activities. The perform quality assurance process is used for applying
       the planned systematic quality activities to ensure that the project employs all the
       planned processes needed to meet all the project requirements. This process is used
       during the execution of the project, and I discuss it in this section.
       Quality control. This refers to monitoring the project results to ensure they meet
       the agreed-upon quality standards. This topic is covered in the next chapter.
  Performing organizations typically have a department called quality assurance (QA) that over-
  sees the quality assurance activities and fosters continuous process improvement, which is an
  iterative method for improving the quality of all processes.
  Figure 6.7 depicts the perform quality assurance process.




      FIGURE 6.7 The perform quality assurance process: input, tools and techniques, and output
180   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT




                   TIP
             Continuous process improvement enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the
             processes by minimizing waste (unnecessary activities) and duplication of efforts. It
             includes identifying and reviewing the business processes inside the organization,
             such as coding of modules within software programs and the process of project
             approval.



   Input to Performing Quality Assurance
       The input to the quality assurance process comes largely from three sources: quality planning,
       direct and manage project execution, and quality control. The quality-related output items of
       these three processes become the input to the quality assurance process. These input items are
       discussed here.
       Output from quality planning. The following output items from the quality planning process
       become the input into the quality assurance process:
            Quality management plan. This plan is the output of the quality planning process
            discussed in Chapter 4, and it describes how QA will be performed for this project.
            Quality metrics. A quality metric is an operational criterion that defines in specific
            terms what something (such as a characteristic or a feature) is and how the quality
            control process measures it. The quality metrics developed during quality planning,
            such as defect density, failure rates, reliability, and test coverage, must be employed
            during QA.
            Process improvement plan. The process improvement plan, discussed in Chapter 4,
            helps improve the quality of the project and must be implemented during QA.
       Output from directing and managing project execution. When you are directing and man-
       aging the project execution, information about the work performance and the implementation
       of a few items will help you determine how the quality is being implemented. Therefore, dur-
       ing QA, you must consider the work performance information and a specific set of imple-
       mented items discussed here:
            Work performance information. Monitoring the project status is one of the crucial
               functions of a project manager during project execution. Work performance infor-
               mation is basically the project status information that is regularly collected and dis-
               tributed among the stakeholders. It includes the following items:
                Schedule progress information:
                    Schedule activities that have been finished and those that have started
                    Estimates for the completion of the schedule activities that have started and
                       hence are in progress
                        PERFORMING QUALITY ASSURANCE                               Chapter 6          181


                Percentages to show the portion of each in-progress activity--for example,
                   activity A is 30% complete
                Deliverables that have been completed and those that have not yet been
               completed
         Incurred cost as compared to authorized cost
         Resource utilization details
         How well the quality standards are being met
         Lessons learned added to the knowledge base
        Implemented items. When you are directing and managing the project execution,
        obviously the items are being implemented. The following quality-related imple-
        mented items must be considered during QA:
         Implemented change requests
         Implemented corrective actions
         Implemented defect repair
         Implemented preventive actions
   Quality control measurements. Quality control involves monitoring specific project results to
   verify whether they meet quality standards. The quality control process sends its results back
   to QA as feedback.
   Approved change requests. Approved change requests, such as modification of work meth-
   ods, product requirements, quality requirements, scope, and schedule, must be analyzed for their
   effect on the quality management plan and quality metrics.
   Some tools and techniques can be used to facilitate the QA process.



               TIP
         All approved changes should be formally documented. Unapproved and undocu-
         mented changes (for example, changes just verbally discussed) must neither be
         processed nor be implemented.




Tools and Techniques for Performing Quality Assurance
   Quality audits and process analysis along with the tools and techniques used in quality plan-
   ning and quality control processes can be used in the QA process.
   Quality audits. A quality audit is a structured and independent review to determine whether
   project activities comply with the policies, processes, and procedures of the project and the
   performing organization. It verifies the implementation of approved change requests, correc-
   tive actions, defect repairs, and preventive actions. The audits can occur as scheduled or at
182   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       random, and can be conducted by a third party or by the properly trained in-house auditors of
       the performing organization. These audits accomplish the following:
            Because one of the objectives of a quality audit is to identify inefficient and ineffec-
            tive policies, processes, and procedures being used for the project, audits reduce the
            cost of quality on the subsequent projects.
            Audits increase customer satisfaction and acceptance of the product or service deliv-
            ered by the project.
       Process analysis. This is a technique used to identify the needed improvements in a process
       by following the steps outlined in the process improvement plan. It examines the problems,
       constraints, and unnecessary (non-value-added) activities identified during the implementation
       of the process. Process analysis typically includes the following steps:
         1. Identify a technique to analyze the problem.
         2. Identify the underlying causes that led to the problem.
         3. Examine the root cause of the problem.
         4. Create preventive actions for this and similar problems.

       Other tools and techniques. The tools and techniques used in the following processes can
       also be used in the QA process:
            Quality planning, already discussed in Chapter 4
            Quality control, discussed in the next chapter
       The quality assurance process recommends corrective actions as an output item.


   Output of Performing Quality Assurance
       The main output of performing quality assurance includes recommended corrective actions and
       change requests. These and other output items are discussed in this section.
       Recommended corrective actions. This is an important output of the QA process. Imple-
       mentation of recommended corrective actions will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of
       the policies, processes, and procedures of the performing organization, and will also improve
       the quality of the product or service delivered by the project. Following are examples of the
       types of recommended actions:
            Audits
            Process analysis that itself might produce a list of preventive actions
            Defect repair, such as bug fixes in a software program
       Requested changes. The goal of quality assurance is improving quality, which involves taking
       actions to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the policies, procedures, and processes of
       the performing organization. One way of accomplishing this is to implement the quality-related
               PROCUREMENT OF PROJECT RESOURCES                                   Chapter 6          183


  changes recommended and approved during the process of directing and managing the project
  execution, including:
       Modifications to policies and procedures
       Modifications to project scope, cost, and schedule
  Updates. As a result of the QA process, you might need to add updates to the following:
       Organizational process assets. The quality standards, policies, procedures, and
       processes of the performing organization are the organization assets that can be
       updated during the QA process.
       Project management plan. The quality assurance process can result in updates to
       the project management plan in the following ways:
        Changes to the quality management plan, which is a part of the project manage-
           ment plan
        Changes to the quality assurance processes
  In some projects you might not find the resources in your organization to complete certain parts
  of the project. This is where the concept called procurement comes into the picture.


Procurement of Project Resources
  Procurement refers to obtaining (purchasing or renting) products, services, or results from out-
  side the project team to complete the project. Procurement management is an execution of a set
  of processes used to obtain (procure) the products, services, or results from outside the project
  team to complete the project. There are two main roles involved in procurement management:
       Buyer. The party purchasing (procuring) the product or service.
       Seller. The party delivering the product or service to the buyer.
  Procurement management includes the following processes:
       Plan purchases and acquisitions. This is the process used to determine what needs
          to be obtained and when and how it will be obtained.
          Plan contracting. This is the process used to determine and document the require-
          ments for the products, services, or results to be obtained and to identify the poten-
          tial sellers.
          Request seller responses. This is the process used to solicit information, quotations,
          bids, offers, or proposals from potential sellers.
          Select sellers. This is the process of selecting sellers by reviewing offers, choosing
          from the candidate sellers, and negotiating a written contract with the sellers.
          Contract administration. This is the process used to manage the contract and the
          relationship between the buyer and the seller by monitoring the seller's performance.
          Contract closure. This is the process used to complete a contract by resolving an
          open issue.
184   Chapter 6       EXECUTING THE PROJECT


   Planning for Procurement
       The plan purchases and acquisitions and plan contracting processes are used to plan the pro-
       curement, whereas the request seller responses and select seller processes are used to imple-
       ment the procurement. Although the procurement planning should be done early in the project,
       like any other planning, it might be necessary at any stage of the project as the need arises due
       to approved changes or other circumstances.


       Make or Buy Decision
       Obviously, procurement refers to buying something as compared to making it in-house. The
       decision to buy or make can be based on one or more of the reasons listed in Table 6.1. Buy
       can mean to purchase or rent. The decision to purchase or rent should be based on the effec-
       tive cost in the long term. For example, if it is a piece of hardware that will be used only in this
       project, you do not anticipate its use in any future project, and renting is significantly cheaper
       than buying, you should probably rent it. You might decide to buy it if this hardware is of com-
       mon use in the kind of work your organization does and therefore it will be used in other pro-
       jects as well.

                     NOTE
               An output of the procurement planning process is the statement of work (SOW),
               which is a document summarizing the work to be performed. The SOW can be writ-
               ten by the buyer or the seller to specify what products will be delivered or what ser-
               vices will be performed. It is also called the contract statement of work.

Before you can buy, you need to get information from the sellers. In other words, you need to
request seller responses. Make or buy analysis is a technique used in the plan purchases and
acquisitions process. Also in this process, you need to use a technique to determine the type of
contract you will use for the procurement.


Determining Contract Types
A contract is a mutually binding agreement between a buyer and a seller that obligates the seller
to provide the specified product, service, or result and obligates the buyer to make the payment
for it. Contracts generally fall into the three categories discussed in this list.
Fixed-price (lump-sum) contracts. A fixed-price contract, also called a lump-sum contract or
a firm fixed-price contract, is an agreement that specifies the fixed total price for the product,
service, or result to be procured. An example of a fixed-price contract is a purchase order for
the specified item to be delivered by a specified date for a specified price. This category of con-
tracts is generally used for products and services that are well-defined and have good histori-
cal information. A fixed-price contract for a poorly defined product or a service with very little
historical record is a source of high risk for both the seller and the buyer.
Cost-reimbursable contracts. A contract in this category includes two kinds of costs:
     Actual cost. This is the payment (reimbursement) to the seller for the actual cost of
     the item, which includes the direct cost and the indirect cost (overhead). An actual
     cost, such as the salary of the project staff working on the item, is incurred directly
     from the work on the item, whereas an indirect cost, such as the cost of utilities and
     equipment for the office of the staff member, is the cost of doing business. Indirect
     cost is generally calculated as a percentage of the actual cost. The actual cost is also
     called the project cost. The project here refers to the project of the seller to produce
     the items for the buyer.
     Fee. This typically represents the seller's profit.
As discussed in the following list, there are three types of cost-reimbursable contracts:
     Cost plus fee (CPF) or cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC). The payment to the
     seller includes the actual cost and the fee, which is a percentage of the actual cost.
     Note that the fee is not fixed; it varies with the actual cost.
     Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF). The payment to the seller includes the actual cost and a
     fixed fee, which can be calculated as a percentage of the estimated project cost. Note
     that the fee is fixed and does not vary with the actual project cost.
     Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF). The payment to the seller includes the actual cost
     and a predetermined incentive bonus based on achieving certain objectives.
186   Chapter 6       EXECUTING THE PROJECT



                      NOTE
             Both fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts can optionally include
             incentives--for example, a bonus from the buyer to the seller if the seller meets
             certain target schedule dates or exceeds some other predetermined expectations.


       Because cost overrun can occur in any type of cost-reimbursable contract, and the cost over-
       run will be paid by the buyer, this category of contract poses risk to the buyer.
       Time and material (T&M) contracts. This category of contracts is a hybrid that contains some
       aspects from both the fixed-price category and the cost-reimbursable category. The contracts
       in this category resemble the contracts in the cost-reimbursable category because the total cost
       and the exact quantity of the items is not fixed at the time of the agreement. The contracts
       resemble fixed-price contracts because the unit rates can be fixed in the contract. These types
       of contracts are useful when you do not know the quantity of the procured items. For exam-
       ple, you do not know how much time a contract programmer will take to develop a software
       program, so you determine the hourly rate in the contract, but not the total cost for writing
       the program. In this category of contracts, the risk is high for the buyer because the buyer
       agreed to pay for all the time the seller takes to produce the deliverables.
       Table 6.2 lists different types of contracts and the corresponding risk bearers.


        Table 6.2 Risk Bearers in Different Categories of Contracts
        Contract Type          Risk Bearer        Explanation

        Fixed price            Buyer and seller   The cost overrun is borne by the seller, whereas the price

        Time and material      Buyer              The increased cost due to the increased quantity of
                                                  resources, such as work hours by a contractor, is borne by
                                                  the buyer.

   The major tasks of procurement planning are making buy or make decisions, preparing the pro-
   curement management plan, preparing the statement of work, determining the suitable type of
   contract, and preparing or acquiring the procurement documents. Once you have these ele-
   ments in place, you are ready to implement the procurement plan.


Implementing the Procurement of Project Resources
   The plan purchases and acquisitions and the plan contracting processes are used to plan the
   procurement, whereas the request seller responses and select seller processes are used to imple-
   ment the procurement.


   Requesting Seller Responses
   Seller responses are requested by using the request seller responses process. The responses can
   be solicited in form of bids, quotations, proposals, or offers. The major input to the request
   seller process comes from the procurement management plan.


   Input to the Request Seller Responses Process
   The input items to the request seller responses plan include the procurement management plan,
   procurement documents, and procurement-related organizational process assets. These input
   items are discussed in the following list.
   Procurement management plan. The major input to the request seller responses process is
   the procurement management plan, which in turn is an output of the plan purchase and acqui-
   sition process. The procurement management plan includes the following:
           Identifying any prequalified selected sellers
           Procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts and evaluate sellers
           Types of contracts to be used and the format for the contract statement of work
           Assumptions and constraints that could affect planned purchases and acquisitions
           Scheduled dates for the contract deliverables
           Directions to be provided to the seller on developing and maintaining a contract
           work breakdown structure
   Procurement documents. Another input item is the set of procurement documents, which is
   an output of the plan contracting process. The buyer structures these documents with two goals
   in mind:
        To facilitate an accurate and complete response from each prospective seller
        To facilitate easy evaluation of the responses
188   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       These documents include the following:
            A description of the desired form of the response
            A relevant contract statement of work
            Any required contractual provisions, such as a copy of a model contract, and non-
               disclosure provisions


                    TIP
             In government contracting, some or all of the content and structure of a procurement
             document might already be defined by regulations.


       Different terms are used for these documents for different purposes:
            A term such as bid, tender, or quotation is used when the seller selection decision will
               be based on the price, when buying commercial or standard items.
            A term such as proposal is used when multiple factors are considered, such as cost,
            technical skills, and technical approach.
            Common names for these different kinds of documents include invitation for bid,
            request for quotation, tender notice, request for proposal, and contractor initial response.
       The procurement documents should be rigorous enough to ensure consistent responses from
       different sellers that can be fairly compared with one another and flexible enough to allow the
       sellers to offer suggestions on better ways to satisfy the requirements. How are the requests
       sent to the potential sellers? This is done according to the policies of the buyer's organiza-
       tion--for example, publication of the request in the public media, such as newspapers, maga-
       zines, and the Internet.


                    NOTE
             Bids and quotations are typically used to ask for prices, whereas proposals are used to
             ask for solutions. Invitations for bid, requests for quotation, and requests for proposal travel
             from buyer to seller, whereas bids, quotations, and proposals travel from seller to buyer.


       Organizational process assets. The organizational process assets relevant to requesting seller
       responses include the following:
            A list of prospective sellers
            A list of previously used or qualified sellers
            Information about the past experiences with previously used sellers
       With the availability of this input, requests can be facilitated using various techniques.

Tools and Techniques for the Request Seller Responses Process
The goal for the tools and techniques here is to find the sellers and provide them with the
information about the requests for responses. Main techniques used in requesting seller
responses are advertising and bidder conferences. These and other techniques are discussed in
this section.
Developing a list of qualified sellers. The list of potential sellers can be developed from var-
ious sources, such as the World Wide Web, library directories, relevant local associations, trade
catalogs, and the performing organization's internal information base.
Advertising. The request for seller responses can be advertised in the public media or in rele-
vant professional journals. Whether to use advertising depends on the organization's policy.
However, some government jurisdictions require public advertising of pending government
contracts.
Bidder conferences. This refers to meetings with prospective sellers prior to preparation of a
response to ensure that the sellers have a clear understanding of the procurement, such as the
technical and contractual requirements. These meetings can generate amendments to the doc-
uments. All potential sellers should be given the same amount of information (or help) during
this interaction so that each seller has an equal opportunity to produce the best response.
These conferences are also called contractor conferences, vendor conferences, or pre-bid conferences.
By using these techniques, you can generate the output of the request seller responses process.

Output from the Request Seller Responses Process
The output of the request seller responses process includes the list of qualified sellers, the
request material to be submitted to the sellers, and the responses submitted by the sellers. These
output items are discussed in the following list.
     List of qualified sellers. This is the list of sellers who will be asked to submit a
        response for this procurement, such as a bid, quotation, or proposal.
     Procurement document package. This is a set of documents that comprises the for-
     mal request prepared by the buyer that will be sent to the qualified sellers.
     Proposal. A proposal is a response provided by a qualified seller to a request by the
     buyer. In other words, a proposal constitutes a formal and legal offer in response to a
     buyer's request.


             NOTE
      In some cases, after a proposal is submitted the buyer can request the seller to sup-
      plement its proposal with an oral presentation to provide some additional information,
      which can be used to evaluate the seller's proposal.
190   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       After proposals (responses) have been submitted, you need to evaluate those proposals and
       select the sellers.


       Selecting Sellers
       Proposals obtained during the request seller responses process are evaluated in the select sell-
       ers process--that is, the process used to select one or more sellers for procurement. The main
       tasks performed during the select sellers process are the following:
            Review seller responses to buyer requests
            Select one or more sellers based on their responses
            Negotiate written contracts with the selected sellers
       Figure 6.8 shows the select sellers process.




           FIGURE 6.8 The select sellers process: input, tools and techniques, and output


       Input to Selecting Sellers
       The procurement management plan and the output from the request seller responses process
       are the major input items to the select sellers process. These and other input items are discussed
       in this section.
             PROCUREMENT OF PROJECT RESOURCES                                    Chapter 6       191


Output from the request seller responses process. The following output items from the
request seller responses process, discussed earlier in this chapter, become the input items to the
select sellers process:
     Proposals
     Procurement document package
     Qualified sellers list
Evaluation criteria. The buyer develops the evaluation criteria to rate the responses from the
sellers. The evaluation criteria could be as simple as the price for off-the-shelf standard items,
or it could be a combination of factors for a more complex proposal. Following is a list of some
examples of evaluation criteria:
     Cost. To evaluate the overall cost, you should consider all cost-related factors, such as:
      Purchase price
      Delivery cost
      Operating cost
     Business aspects. This can include the following factors:
      Business size and type. Does the business size or type meet a condition set forth
         in the contract, such as being a small business or a disadvantaged small business?
         Financial capacity. Does the seller have the financial capacity to do the job, or is
         the seller in a position to obtain the necessary financial resources to do the job?
         Production capacity and interest. Does the seller have the capacity and the
         interest to meet future potential requirements?
         References. Can the seller provide reliable references (such as from previous cus-
         tomers) verifying the seller's work experience and history of compliance with
         contractual requirements?
     Management approach. If the procurement itself involves a project, does the seller
     have the ability to execute management processes and procedures to run a successful
     project?
     Rights. The following rights can be considered:
      Intellectual property rights. Will the seller own the intellectual property rights
         for the work processes or services that will be used to produce the deliverables?
      Proprietary rights. Will the seller have the proprietary rights for the work
         processes or services that will be used to produce the deliverables?
     Technical aspects. This includes the technical approach and capability:
      Technical approach. Will the technical methodologies, techniques, solutions, or
         services proposed by the seller meet the procurement requirements, or will they
         provide more than the expected results?
      Technical capability. Does the seller have or is the seller capable of acquiring
         the technical skills and knowledge required to produce the deliverables?
192   Chapter 6    EXECUTING THE PROJECT


       Procurement management plan. I discussed this plan earlier in this chapter.
       Project management plan. As you know by now, the project management plan provides an
       overall plan for managing the project, and it consists of subsidiary plans and components. Out
       of these the following can be useful in the select seller process: the procurement management
       plan, the risk management plan, the risk register, and the risk-related contractual agreements.
       Organizational process assets. The buyer organization might have formal policies that could
       affect the evaluation of responses from the sellers.
       With this input in place, you use some tools and techniques to select the sellers.

       Tools and Techniques for Selecting Sellers
       The tools and techniques used to select the sellers include contract negotiations, a screening
       system, and selection techniques.
       Evaluation techniques. These techniques are used to make the final selection of the sellers.
       These techniques are discussed in the following list:
            Independent estimates. The purpose of independent estimates is to have a check on
            the proposed pricing by the seller. The procuring organization prepares the indepen-
            dent estimate in-house or has it done by a third party. Significant differences
            between the proposed price and the independent estimate mean that either the mar-
            ket has changed or the seller has failed to offer reasonable pricing due to reasons
            such as failure to understand the contract statement of work. The independent esti-
            mates are also called should-cost estimates.
            Seller rating system. A seller's rating does not depend on a specific response that
            you are evaluating. Rather, the seller's rating comes from the seller's rating system,
            which is developed by multiple organizations based on multiple factors related to
            seller's past performance, such as delivery performance, contractual compliance, and
            quality rating.
            Weighting system. The purpose of putting a weighting system in place is to have an
               objective evaluation as opposed to a subjective evaluation influenced by personal
               prejudice. The weighting system uses a method to quantify the qualitative data and
               typically involves the following steps:
               1. Assign a numerical weight to each of the evaluation criteria according to its
                    importance, such as w1, w2, and w3 for three criteria, and make these weights
                    the same for each seller.
               2. Rate the seller on each criterion, such as r1, r2, and r3. These ratings depend
                    upon the seller.
               3. Multiply the weight by the rate for each criterion.
               4. Add the results in the previous step to compute an overall score, such as s1 for
                    seller 1: s1 = r1 * w1 + r2 * w2 + r3 * w3.
             PROCUREMENT OF PROJECT RESOURCES                                     Chapter 6       193


     Expert judgment. The expert judgment is made by an experts committee that con-
     sists of experts from each of the disciplines covered by the procurement documents
     and the proposed contract. The committee can include experts from functional disci-
     plines, such as accounting, contracts, engineering, finance, legal, manufacturing, and
     research and development.
     Proposal evaluation techniques. Different techniques can be used to evaluate
     responses from sellers. All these techniques can use expert judgment and evaluation
     criteria. The factors that can be considered in the evaluation include the following:
      Price. This can play a primary role in the selection of off-the-shelf standard
          items. However, you should consider that the lower price does not mean lower
          cost if the seller does not deliver in time.
      Multiple aspects. Proposals are usually evaluated for different aspects, such as
          technical and commercial. Technical refers to the overall approach, whereas com-
          mercial refers to the cost.
      Multiple sources. For products critical to the project, multiple sources (sellers)
          might be required. This redundancy will help mitigate such risks as failure to
          meet the delivery schedule or quality requirements.



             TIP
      Sellers in procurement are sometimes also called sources.


        The evaluation criteria are discussed in detail as the input to the select sellers
        process.
Screening system. A screening system consists of minimum requirements as a threshold that
must be met if the seller has to stay in the list of candidate sellers. It might, for example, con-
sist of one or more evaluation criteria. The screening system can also use the weighting system
and independent estimates.
Contract negotiations. The contract negotiations have the following goals:
     Clarify the structure and requirements of the contract
     Reach an agreement
The subjects covered during the negotiations might include the following:
        Applicable terms and laws
        Authorities, rights, and responsibilities
        Business management and technical approaches
        Contract financing
194   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT


               Payments and price
               Proprietary rights
               Schedule
               Technical solutions
       The conclusion of contract negotiations is a document, the contract, which can be signed by
       both the buyer and the seller. The final contract signed by both parties can be an offer by the
       seller or a counteroffer by the buyer. Sometimes for simple procurement items, the contract is
       non-negotiable.



                    TIP
             A contract is a mutually binding legal relationship subject to remedy in the court. The
             project manager might not be the lead negotiator on the contract. However, the pro-
             ject manager might be required to be present during negotiations to provide any nec-
             essary clarification on the project requirements.


       In the select sellers process, you basically evaluate, screen, and negotiate. In general, multiple
       tools and techniques are used to evaluate responses and make a selection.


       Output of Selecting Sellers
       Using the select sellers process, the sellers are selected, the contracts are signed, and the con-
       tract management plan is prepared. These and other output items of the select sellers process
       are discussed in this section.
       Selected sellers. This is the list of sellers that you have selected as a result of response evalu-
       ations.
       Contract management. The contract management includes the contract and its management
       plan.
            Contract. This is the contract awarded to a selected seller. It is a legal document
               that obligates the seller to provide the specified products, services, or results, and
               obligates the buyer to make the payment to the seller. The contract can be a simple
               purchase order or a complex document, depending on the nature of the procure-
               ment. A contract can include, but is not limited to, the following sections:
                Acceptance criteria
                Change-request handling
                Inflation adjustments
                Insurance

         Limitation of liability
         Penalties and incentives
         Pricing and payment
         Product support
         Roles and responsibilities
         Schedule
         Statement of work
         Termination and dispute-handling mechanism
         Warranty
     Contract management plan. Depending upon the size and complexity of the pro-
     curement, a contract can be administered through its lifecycle by a contract manage-
     ment plan, which becomes a subset of the project management plan.
Resource availability. This contains the information on the quantity and availability of the
resources--for example, the dates on which a resource will be active or idle.
Changes and updates. The select sellers process can generate the following changes and
updates:
     Change requests. The selection process can generate change requests for the project
     management plan and its subsidiary plans and components, such as the project
     schedule and the procurement management plan. These change requests must be
     processed through the integrated change control system before implementation.
     Updates to the procurement management plan. If a procurement-related change
     request is approved, the procurement management plan should be updated to reflect
     the change.
The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
     Direct and manage project execution is a high-level process to produce the project
     deliverables. To accomplish this, you need to do two things:
      1. Acquire the project team, develop it, and manage it to perform the project
          activities.
      2. Procure the items that cannot be produced by the project team.
     Procurement involves preparing the procurement management plan and implement-
     ing the plan by requesting seller responses, evaluating seller responses, selecting sell-
     ers based on the evaluation, and negotiating and signing contracts with the selected
     sellers.
     Use the perform quality assurance process to apply the planned systematic quality
     activities to ensure that the project employs all the planned processes needed to meet
     all the project requirements.
196   Chapter 6     EXECUTING THE PROJECT



   Summary
       The project management plan is executed using the processes in the executing process group.
       The high-level process in this group is the direct and manage project execution process, whose
       main goal is to produce the project deliverables. To make that happen, you need to put together
       a project team, and then you and the team need to perform multiple actions, such as perform-
       ing schedule activities, training and managing the project team members, and obtaining pro-
       posals from the seller for the project items that need to be procured. These actions are
       performed using processes discussed in this chapter. For example, you put together a project
       team using the acquire project team process. The main output of the acquire project team
       process are the project staff assignments, which become the input to the develop project team
       process. This process uses training, recognition and rewards, and other team-building tech-
       niques to develop a cohesive and efficient team with high performance. You manage the pro-
       ject team using the manage project team process to improve the team performance.
       Due to a lack of resources in the performing organization, you might need to obtain some prod-
       ucts, services, or results from outside the project team to complete the project. This is called
       procurement. The plan purchases and acquisitions as well as the plan contracting processes are
       used to plan the procurement, which includes preparing the procurement management plan
       and the procurement documents. The request seller responses and select sellers processes are
       used to implement the procurement plan, which involves obtaining seller responses, selecting
       sellers based on the responses, and reaching an agreement with the selected sellers, such as a
       contract to obtain (procure) the products, services, or results.
       In addition to performing the project work to produce the project deliverables, a significant
       task to perform during the project execution is quality assurance. The goal of quality assurance
       is to improve quality, which involves taking actions to increase the effectiveness and efficiency
       of the policies, procedures, and processes of the performing organization.
       The project execution, along with initiation, planning, and closing, needs to be monitored and
       controlled. This is the topic of the next chapter.
                                                               SUMMARY                  Chapter 6        197


Exam's Eye View
Comprehend

 The goal of the acquire project team process is to fill the roles defined in the staffing manage-
    ment plan with real individuals who will perform those roles to execute the project.

 Regardless of how much control you have over staff assignments, always try to obtain the best
    person for the job by doing your homework, which includes finding out the availability and
    competencies of the candidate team members.

 The staff assignments made in the acquire project team process are the input to the develop
    project team process, which uses techniques such as training, recognition and rewards, and
    other team-building activities.

 The main output items from the human resource planning, acquire project team, and develop
    project team processes become the input to the manage project team process.

Look Out

 Invitations for bid, requests for quotation, and requests for proposal travel from buyer to seller,
    whereas bids, quotations, and proposals travel from seller to buyer.

 Of all the contract types discussed in this chapter, only the firm fixed-price contract can pre-
    sent risk to the seller.

 The contract type that presents the most risk to the buyer is the cost plus percentage of cost
    contract because the fee (which is a percentage cost) also increases if cost overrun occurs.

Memorize

 Team development goes through five progressive stages: forming, storming, norming, per-
    forming, and adjourning.

 The strategies used to resolve conflicts include avoidance, competition, compromise, accom-
    modation, and collaboration. Collaboration is the best strategy because it offers a win/win res-
    olution.

 The input of the quality assurance (QA) process comes from the output of three processes:
    quality planning, quality control, and direct and manage project execution.

 In procurement, a term such as bid, tender, or quotation is used when the seller selection deci-
    sion will be based on the price when buying commercial or standard items, whereas a term
    such as proposal is used when multiple factors are considered, such as cost, technical skills, and
    technical approach.

   Key Terms
            asynchronous communication. A communication in which the two communicating
              entities do not have to be present on both ends of the communication line at the
              same time. E-mail is an example of asynchronous communication because when the
              sender of the e-mail pushes the send button, the intended recipient of the e-mail
              message does not have to be logged on to the e-mail server.
              contract. A mutually binding agreement between a buyer and a seller that obligates
              the seller to provide the specified product, service, or result and obligates the buyer
              to make the payment for it.
              corrective actions. Directions for executing the project work to bring expected pro-
              ject performance in conformance with the project management plan. This is an out-
              put item of the QA process.
              perform quality assurance. A process used for applying the planned systematic
              quality activities to ensure that the project employs all the planned processes needed
              to meet all the project requirements.
              preventive actions. Directions to perform an activity that will reduce the probability
              of negative consequences associated with project risks. These preventive actions are
              recommended by the QA process during process analysis.

                              risk monitoring and controlling process. You should
                              also be familiar with the risk response techniques,
                              such as acceptance, transference, and mitigation, dis-
                              cussed in Chapter 4.
Introduction
  You need to continually monitor and control your project. Executing a project means execut-
  ing the project work according to the project management plan based on some baselines, such
  as a schedule baseline, a scope baseline, and a cost baseline. In general, monitoring means
  watching the course, and controlling means taking action to either stay the course or change
  the wrong course. You monitor the project by generating, collecting, and distributing infor-
  mation about project performance against the baselines. Deviations of the performance results
  from the plan might indicate that some changes to the original project plan are required.
  Other change requests might come from stakeholders, such as expanding the project scope by
  adding new requirements. You control all these changes by influencing the factors that gener-
  ate them, processing them through a system called the integrated change control system that con-
  tains a process called the integrated change control process, evaluating their impact across the
  project, and ensuring the implementation of the approved change requests.
  In addition to the schedule activities that need to be executed, the project management plan
  also contains a list of risks and the risk management plan. You monitor the risks by looking
  out for the risk triggers (the alerts that tell you a risk has occurred or is about to occur) for the
  already identified risks and by identifying new risks as the project progresses. You control the
  risks by executing the risk response plan and taking corrective and preventive actions.
  Therefore, the core question in this chapter is, how do you monitor and control a project? In
  search of an answer, we will explore three avenues in the area of monitoring and controlling:
  performance, changes, and risks.



Monitoring and Controlling the
Project Work
  You monitor and control your project by monitoring and controlling the project performance,
  changes, and risks. Monitoring includes measuring the project performance, collecting and dis-
  tributing information about the project performance, and evaluating the performance infor-
  mation to see the trends. Continuous monitoring helps the project management team identify
  the areas that need to be controlled closely by, for example, taking corrective or preventive
  actions.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT WORK                                       Chapter 7     205


  Some of the major tasks involved in monitoring and controlling the project are the following:
       Monitoring project performance by measuring it against the project management
          plan in terms of parameters such as cost, schedule, and scope
          Monitoring the project by collecting information to support status reporting,
          progress measurement, and predictions, and then distributing this information
          among the stakeholders
          Evaluating performance to determine whether it needs to be controlled by taking
          corrective or preventive actions
          Monitoring risks by tracking and analyzing the already identified project risks and
          by identifying new risks
          Controlling risks by managing the execution of risk response plans when the risks
          occur
          Maintaining an accurate and timely information base regarding the project as it
          progresses
          Monitoring and controlling changes and monitoring the implementation of
          approved changes


              NOTE
       Monitoring and controlling does not start only after the project starts execution.
       Rather, the project needs to be monitored and controlled all the way from initiation
       through closing.


  A project is monitored and controlled using the monitor and control project work process,
  which is a high-level process that is performed by executing more specific processes, such as
  cost control, schedule control, and scope control, as shown in Figure 7.1. All these processes
  are in the monitoring and controlling process group.




      FIGURE 7.1 Some processes in the monitoring and controlling process group
206   Chapter 7    MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       The change requests arising from monitoring and controlling the project or originating from
       any other source, such as the stakeholders, must be processed through the integrated change
       control process.



   Integrated Change Control Process
       The integrated change control process is used to manage changes to the project from project
       initiation through project closure. A project rarely runs exactly according to the project man-
       agement plan, and therefore changes will inevitably appear. The change requests can come from
       evaluating the project performance to bring the project in line with the project management
       plan, or they can come from other sources, such as the stakeholders. Regardless of where they
       originate from, all changes need to be managed (monitored and controlled), which includes
       getting the changes rejected or approved, seeing the approved changes implemented, and
       changing the affected plans accordingly. You, the project manager, must manage changes proac-
       tively, which includes the following activities:
            Identifying a change that has occurred and receiving a change request.
            Getting the requested changes approved or rejected. Depending on the project and
            the performing organization, the authority to determine whether a change is eventu-
            ally rejected or approved might lie with the project manager, a customer, a sponsor,
            or a committee.
            Monitoring and controlling the flow of approved changes, which includes:
             Making sure they are implemented.
             Maintaining the integrity of the project baseline (cost, schedule, and scope) by
                updating it to incorporate the approved changes.
             Coordinating changes and their impact across the project and updating the
                affected documentation. For example, an approved schedule change might
                impact cost, quality, risk, and staffing.
            Controlling project quality--for example, through defect repairs and recommended
            corrective and preventive actions.
            Making sure that only the approved changes are implemented.


                   TIP
             Especially in a startup organization, you will notice quite often the changes making
             their way through the back door--for example, a product manager talking to an engi-
             neer directly and introducing changes. Do not consider yourself an opponent of
             changes by default, but you do need to manage changes and make sure each
             change goes through the integrated change control process. So, when it comes to
             changes, the keyword is control, and not necessarily oppose.

   Figure 7.2 shows the integrated change control process. The change requests that need to be
   approved are the obvious input to this process.




       FIGURE 7.2 The integrated change control process: input, tools and techniques, and output


Input to Integrated Change Control
   Each requested change and recommended action must be processed through the integrated
   change control process. The approved changes have their effects on the project management
   plan, and therefore the plan needs to be updated accordingly. Following are the input items to
   the integrated change control process:
        Requested changes. This is the obvious input. A requested change goes through the
           integrated change control process.
        Recommended items. The following recommended items should also go through
        the integrated change control process.
         Recommended corrective actions
         Recommended preventive actions
         Recommended defect repairs
        These recommendations might arise from performance evaluations, and they are the
        output of various processes discussed in this chapter.
        Project management plan, including deliverables. This is needed to help identify
        the changes and make updates after the changes have been approved.
        Work performance information. The performance information is the input because
        performance deviations from the plan will trigger change requests or recommended
        corrective or preventive actions to improve the situation.
   So what tools and techniques are available to process these requests and recommendations?
   Read on....
208   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


   Tools and Techniques for Integrated Change Control
       You can use project management methodology and project management information systems
       to implement the integrated change control process. You can also use the expertise of the stake-
       holders to approve and reject change requests. Following are the tools and techniques available
       for the integrated change control process.
       Project management methodology. Recall that the project management plan contains the out-
       put of the project planning processes. This plan defines how the project is executed, moni-
       tored/controlled, and closed. But how do you implement (that is, execute) the project
       management plan? Every organization will have its own method for implementing the project
       management plan for its projects; this is called its project management methodology. This is a
       high-level method on top of the standard project management processes discussed in this book.
       The project management methodology of an organization will also define the high-level
       process for the project management team to implement the integrated change control for the
       project. For example, different organizations might have different answers to the following
       questions:


                    NOTE
             It's important to distinguish between the project management body of knowledge
             (which is essentially a set of processes) canned by PMI and the project management
             methodology, which is a structured approach to developing and executing the project
             management plan. The methodology refers to the issues such as which of the PMI
             processes to implement and how to implement them. It facilitates the implementation
             through, for example, templates, best practices, and procedures.


            How will the change requests be submitted?
            Who will reject or approve the change requests?
       Once you have the methodology in place, you need a system to implement the methodology.
       Project management information system. This is a collection of tools and techniques (man-
       ual and automated) used to gather, integrate, and disseminate the output of project manage-
       ment processes. This system is used to facilitate processes from the initiation stage all the way
       to the closing stage. Microsoft Project, a product that lets you create a project schedule, is an
       example of such a tool. Another example of the components of the project management infor-
       mation system could be a document management system to create, review, change, and approve
       the documents to facilitate the change control procedure.
       The project management information system might also have tools that can help the project
       management team implement the integrated change control process.

   Expert judgment. The project management team can use the experts on the change control
   board to make approval or rejection decisions about change requests.
   The rejection or approval of the change request is an obvious output of the integrated change
   control process.


Output from Integrated Change Control
   The changes that are processed through the integrated change control process will either be
   rejected or approved. As a result of the approved changes, the project management plan might
   need to be updated. Accordingly, following are the output items of the integrated change con-
   trol process:
   Approved and rejected items. The items processed through the integrated change control
   process will either be approved or rejected. These items include change requests, suggested
   defect repairs, recommendations for corrective actions, and recommendations for preventive
   actions.
   Validated items. Some change-related items that have been implemented, such as defect
   repairs, will be validated.
   Updates. As a result of approved changes, items such as the project management plan and the
   project scope statement might need to be updated.
   So, the requested changes are either rejected or approved in the integrated change control
   process.
   Project performance, a factor that you monitor and control, is closely related to quality, which
   is the degree to which the project requirements are fulfilled. For example, a good-quality pro-
   ject is a project that is completed within its planned cost, scope, and schedule. Any variations
   from the planned cost, schedule, and scope performance indicate the degradation of project
   quality. So, controlling the performance correlates strongly to controlling the quality.



Controlling Quality
   Controlling quality involves monitoring specific results to determine whether they comply with
   the planned quality standards, which include project processes and product goals, and control-
   ling the results by taking actions to eliminate unsatisfactory performance. The perform qual-
   ity control process is used to monitor and control quality by accomplishing the following goals:
        Monitor specific project results, such as cost performance and schedule performance,
        to determine whether they comply with the planned quality standards, which
        include project processes and product goals.
        Identify ways to eliminate the causes of unsatisfactory performance.
210   Chapter 7    MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       The results under scrutiny include both deliverables and performance measurements by the pro-
       ject management team. Quality control is performed throughout the project. While dealing
       with quality control, you must be able to distinguish the two terms in each of the following
       pairs from each other:
            Prevention and inspection
             Prevention is a direction to perform an activity that will keep an error from
               entering the product and the process.
             Inspection is a technique to examine whether an activity, component, product,
               result, or service complies with planned requirements. The goal of inspection is
               to ensure that errors do not reach the customer.
            Attribute sampling and variable sampling
             Attribute sampling is a technique to determine whether a result conforms to the
               specified standard.
             Variable sampling is a technique to rate a result on a continuous scale that mea-
               sures the degree of conformity.
            Common cause and special cause
             Common cause is a source of variation that is inherent to the system and is pre-
               dictable. Such variations are also called normal variations, and the common
               causes for them are also called random causes.
             Special cause is a source of variation that is not inherent to the system and is
               removable. It can be assigned to a defect in the system.
            Control limits and tolerances
             Control limits are the area occupied by three standard deviations on either side
               of the central line or the mean of a normal distribution of data plotted on a con-
               trol chart that reflects the expected variation of the data. If the results fall within
               the control limits, they are within the quality control.
             Tolerance is the range within which a result is acceptable if it falls within the
               limits of the range.
       Figure 7.3 shows the perform quality control process.



                   TIP
            QC can be performed by the QA department or by the QC department if the perform-
            ing organization has one. Nevertheless, the project management team should have a
            working knowledge of statistical aspects of quality control, such as sampling and
            probability. This will help evaluate the QC output.

Input to Quality Control
    The goal of quality control is to ensure that the performance from the project execution meets
    the planned quality standards. Therefore, the outputs from the project execution and from the
    quality planning are the obvious inputs to the perform quality control process. These and other
    input items are discussed here:
         Quality planning output. The following items from the output of the quality plan-
         ning process, discussed in Chapter 4, are the input into the perform quality control
         process:
          The quality management plan lets you know how the quality standards are sup-
             posed to be implemented.
          Quality metrics specify which quality features to monitor and how to measure
             them.
          Quality checklists show which quality steps need to be performed.
         Output from direct and manage project execution. The following items from the
         output of the direct and manage project execution process, discussed in Chapter 6,
         are input into the perform quality control process:
          A list of deliverables from the project execution to ensure that all the required
             deliverables are produced before the project completion
          Work performance information to monitor performance
212   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


            Approved change requests. You need this list to ensure that all the approved
            changes are implemented in a timely fashion. The list of approved change requests
            also includes modifications, such as revised work methods and a revised schedule.
            Organizational process assets. These include quality policies and procedures,
            change control procedures, and quality-related historical data. These items will be
            used in the quality control process.
       Quality control is a very involved process and has a plethora of tools and techniques, discussed
       next.


   Tools and Techniques for Quality Control
       The tools and techniques used for quality control include inspection, defect repair reviews, and
       the so-called seven basic tools of quality.


       Seven Basic Tools of Quality
       Table 7.1 shows the seven kinds of charts used in quality control, also known as the seven basic
       tools of quality. These tools are described in the following sections, too.

       Flowcharts
       A flowchart is a diagram that depicts inputs, actions, and outputs of one or more processes in
       a system. Flowcharts, commonly used in many disciplines of knowledge, show the activities,
       decision points, and order of processing. They help to understand how a problem occurs. You
       can also use flowcharts to anticipate what quality problems might be, where they might occur,
       and how you might deal with them.

Run Charts
Run charts are used to perform trend analysis, which is the science of predicting future per-
formance based on past results. In quality control, trend analysis can be used to predict such
things as the number of defects and the cost to repair them. You can use the results of trend
analysis to recommend preventive actions if needed.

Scatter Diagrams
A scatter diagram is used to show the pattern of the relationship between two variables--an
independent variable and another variable that depends on the independent variable. The
dependent variable is plotted corresponding to the independent variable. For example, a vari-
able representing a cause can be the independent variable, and a variable representing the
effect can be a dependent variable. The closer the data points are to a diagonal line, the stronger
the relationship (called the correlation) is between the two variables.


Histograms
A histogram is a bar chart that shows a distribution of variables. Each bar can represent an
attribute, such as defects due to a specific cause, and its height can represent the frequency of
the attribute, such as number of defects. This tool helps to identify and rate the causes of
defects.
You might wonder how the defects can be repaired efficiently. Pareto diagrams, which are exam-
ples of histograms, have the answer for you.


Pareto Diagrams
A Pareto diagram is used to rank the importance of each error (problem) based on the frequency
of its occurrence over time in the form of defects. A defect is an imperfection or deficiency that
keeps a component from meeting its requirements or specifications. A defect is caused by an
error (problem) and can be repaired by fixing the error. An error in a product can give rise to
multiple defects, and by fixing the error you repair all the defects caused by that error.
However, all errors are not equal. Some errors cause more defects than others. According to
Pareto's law, which is also known as the 80/20 rule, 80 percent of project defects are caused by
20 percent of errors (or types of errors). Qualitatively, it means that most defects are caused by
a small set of errors. The Pareto diagram lets you rank errors based on the frequency of defects
they cause. You begin by having the error that causes most of the defects fixed and make your
way to other errors that cause smaller numbers of defects. This way the efforts of the project
team are optimized: You get the maximum number of defects repaired with minimal effort.
The advantages of a Pareto diagram are twofold:
     It ranks errors according to the frequency of defects they cause.
     It optimizes efforts to repair the defects by working on the errors that cause most of
        the defects.
214   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       As an example, Table 7.2 presents data on the frequency of defects caused by certain errors.
       The data is displayed in Figure 7.4 in the form of a Pareto diagram. In this example, 200
       defects are caused by seven errors, and error A alone causes 75 defects, which is 37.5% of all
       the defects. Similarly, you can understand the impact of other errors by looking at Table 7.2
       and Figure 7.4. The Pareto diagram tells you that you should address error A first, error B sec-
       ond, and so on.

                   NOTE
             Pareto's Law, in its original form, was presented as an economic theory by Vilfredo
             Pareto, a 19th-century Italian economist, and it states that 80 percent of income is
             earned by 20 percent of the population. Since then, it has been applied to other
             fields, such as project management.


       You might ask: How many defects are acceptable? To find an answer to this question, you need
       to understand another tool, called the control chart.


       Control Charts
       Control charts are used to monitor whether the variance of a specified variable is within the
       acceptable limits dictated by quality control. A variance is a measurable deviation in the value
       of a project variable, such as cost from a known baseline or expected value. This is a way to
       monitor the deviations and determine whether the corresponding variable is in or out of con-
       trol. The values are taken at different times to measure the behavior of a variable over time.
                                       CONTROLLING QUALITY                      Chapter 7      215




    FIGURE 7.4 An example of a Pareto diagram

The mean value in the control chart represents the expected value, and a predetermined spread
from the mean value (usually 3) is used to define the limits within which an acceptable value
can fall.
Control charts can be used to monitor the values of any type of output variables. To illustrate
their main features, consider the example of a control chart shown in Figure 7.5. In this exam-
ple, assume that a manufacturer produces 100 units of a product each day and it is expected
that 95 out of 100 units should have no defect--that is, the expected number of defective units
is equal to five. The control limits are set to 3. In other words, 95 units out of 100 must be
correct, give or take three. That puts the lower limit at 92 and the upper limit at 98. Crossing
the lower limits is not acceptable to the customer, and crossing the upper limits might require
an unjustifiable cost.
Controlling quality includes dealing with defects and problems that cause them. So, studying
causes of a problem is critical to quality control.

           FIGURE 7.5 An example of a control chart


       Cause and Effect Diagram
       A cause and effect diagram is used to explore all the potential causes (inputs) that result in a
       single effect (output), such as a problem or a defect. This type of diagram is the brainchild of
       Kaoru Ishikawa, who pioneered quality management processes in the Kawasaki shipyards, and
       therefore these diagrams are also called Ishikawa diagrams. Due to the shape of these dia-
       grams, they are also known as fishbone diagrams. To construct and use cause and effect dia-
       grams effectively, perform the following simple steps:
         1. Identify the problem. Write down the problem in the box drawn on the right side of
            a large sheet of paper. This represents the head of the fish. Starting from the box,
            draw a horizontal line across the paper. This represents the spine of the fish.
         2. Identify the possible areas of causes. Identify the areas or factors from where the
            potential causes of the problem might come. Environment, people, materials, mea-
            surements, and methods are some examples of areas (factors) of causes. For each factor
            relevant to the problem under study, draw a line off the spine and label it with the
            name of the factor. These lines represent the fish bones.
         3. Identify the possible causes. For each factor, identify possible causes. Represent each
            possible cause with a line coming off the bone that represents the corresponding factor.
         4. Analyze the diagram. Analyzing the diagram includes narrowing down the most
            likely causes and investigating them further.
                                        CONTROLLING QUALITY                       Chapter 7        217


Figure 7.6 shows an example of a cause and effect diagram. The problem in this example is the
delay in the release of a Web site. The factors considered are environment, methods, people,
and time. Of course, the diagram is incomplete in the sense that more factors and related causes
can be explored, and causes for each factor can be explored further. But you get the point.




    FIGURE 7.6 An example of a cause and effect diagram: Explore the causes for a delay in a Web
                   site release.



             TIP
      While constructing the cause and effect diagram, you can use the brainstorming
      method for identifying the potential factors of causes and the potential causes for
      each factor.



A cause and effect diagram offers a structured way to think through all possible causes of a
problem. You can use these diagrams to carry out a thorough analysis of a problematic situa-
tion. This kind of analysis is useful in complex situations when, to discover the real causes, you
need to explore all the potential causes and not just the obvious ones.
In addition to the seven quality tools we have discussed, there are some other tools that you
can use for quality control.
218   Chapter 7    MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       Other Quality Control Tools
       In addition to the seven quality tools, the following tools can also be used for controlling
       quality:
            Statistical sampling. Statistical sampling involves randomly selecting a part of the
            population for study. In quality control, you can select a subset of features for inspec-
            tion. This can save a substantial amount of resources.
            Inspection. This is a technique to examine whether an activity, component, product,
            service, or result conforms to specific requirements. Inspections can be conducted at
            various levels of project execution. For example, you can inspect the results of a sin-
            gle activity, or you can inspect the final product of the project. Nevertheless, inspec-
            tion generally includes measurements. There are various forms of inspections, such
            as reviews, peer reviews, audits, and walkthroughs.
            Defect repair review. This review is conducted by the QC department or body to
            ensure that the defects are repaired to bring the defective product, service, or results
            in conformance with the specified requirements.
       These tools can be used to make quality control measurements, which in turn can be used to
       recommend preventive and corrective actions: the output of quality control.


   Output of Quality Control
       The quality control measurements and the recommendations based on those measurements
       are the obvious output items of the quality control process. These and other output items are
       discussed in this section.
       Quality control measurements. These are the results of the QC activities and are fed back to
       the QA process. They are also used to make recommendations for corrective and preventive
       actions.
       Recommended items. The quality control process can generate the following kinds of recom-
       mendations:
            Recommended corrective actions. These actions are recommended as a result of
               the QC process to meet the established quality goals.
            Recommended preventive actions. These actions are recommended as a result of
            the QC process to avoid future failure to meet the established quality goals.
            Recommended defect repair. A defect is an imperfection or deficiency that keeps a
            component from meeting its requirements or specifications. Such a component
            needs to be repaired or replaced.
            Requested changes. The recommended corrective or preventive actions might
            require changes to the project. The changes are requested and processed through the
            integrated change control process.
CONTROLLING CHANGES IN COST, SCHEDULE, AND SCOPE                                    Chapter 7       219


    Validated items. These are the items that have been validated through the QC process:
         Validated defect repair. Once a component has been repaired from a defect, it needs
         to be inspected so the repair will be accepted or rejected. The rejected items might
         need to be repaired again. The accepted repair is a validated defect repair.
         Validated deliverables. This refers to verifying the correctness of project deliver-
         ables. A deliverable accepted through a QC process is a validated deliverable.
    Updates. The quality control process might generate updates to the following items:
         Organizational process assets. The completed checklists become part of the project
         record. Furthermore, you can update the lessons-learned database and documenta-
         tion. These might include the causes of variances, the reasons for corrective and pre-
         ventive actions, and the actions that worked and those that did not.
         Project management plan. The project management plan should be updated to
         reflect the changes to the quality management plan resulting from the QC process.
         Quality baseline. The quality baseline might need to be updated to reflect the
         changes to the quality plan resulting from the QC process.
    High-quality projects deliver the promised product, service, or result within the planned cost,
    schedule, and scope. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and control changes to these three
    parameters: cost, schedule, and scope.



Controlling Changes in Cost,
Schedule, and Scope
    Changes to cost, schedule, and scope are controlled using the cost control, schedule control,
    and scope control processes, respectively. These three project parameters comprise a triple con-
    straint that is a framework for evaluating competing demands. A triple constraint is often
    depicted as a triangle, with each corner (or side) representing one of the three parameters. Fig-
    ure 7.7 shows the triple constraint for the cost, schedule, and scope. This means if one of these
    parameters changes, at least one of the other two must change as well.
    For example, assume you are being interviewed by a functional manager for a project manager
    position. Don't be surprised if you are asked a question based on the following situation:
      1. The project is way behind the schedule.
      2. No extra resources, such as money or project team members to perform activities, are
          available.
      3. You have to implement all the planned features.
220   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS




           FIGURE 7.7 Triple constraint: cost, schedule, and scope. You cannot change one side of the triangle
                          without changing at least one of the other two sides.

       The question is, what will you do to meet the deadline that is approaching within a week? From
       a project management viewpoint, this situation is a good example of the triple constraint. The
       project is behind schedule, which means there is a schedule change (or a change in time avail-
       able to finish the remaining project). Therefore, at least one of the other two parameters must
       change. If you want to meet the deadline, either you should be allotted more funds to hire
       more human resources, or the scope of the project should be changed, which means some of
       the features would be left out. Depending upon the knowledge level of the functional manager
       about project management, this answer might not get you the job, but as a project manager,
       you must stand your ground. Project management is not magic; it involves dealing with cold,
       hard reality in a realistic way, thereby establishing clear and achievable objectives.


                    NOTE
             While considering the cost-schedule-scope constraint, you should also remember the
             schedule compression techniques, such as crashing and fast tracking, discussed in
             Chapter 5. Also remember that those techniques do not guarantee that no additional
             cost (or resources) will be required.


       You can see the relationship of triple constraint with quality by recalling that a high-quality
       project delivers the required product on time and within planned scope and budget. Therefore,
       while balancing between these three constraints, the quality (and as a result, customer satis-
       faction) might be affected. The triple constraint is also a good example of how one change can
       give rise to other changes across the project. This highlights the importance of managing and
       controlling changes.
       Cost control is discussed in a later section, and schedule control and scope control are dis-
       cussed in the next section.
CONTROLLING CHANGES IN COST, SCHEDULE, AND SCOPE                                     Chapter 7       221


Schedule Control
    Schedule control has two-pronged goal--to ensure that the project is progressing on time as
    planned, and to monitor any changes to this progress. As a project manager, you should be out
    in front of the project, performing the following tasks on regular basis:
         Determine the current status of the project schedule.
         Influence the factors that generate schedule changes.
         Determine whether the project schedule has changed--for example, if some activi-
         ties are running late.
         Manage the changes as they occur.
    You detect a schedule change by comparing the execution time against the time in the sched-
    ule baseline, which is a major input item to the schedule control process.


    Input to Schedule Control
    To control the project schedule, you need to know what the schedule baseline (that is, the
    expectation) is, how the project is performing from the perspective of schedule, and what the
    plans are to monitor the schedule. Accordingly, the input items to the schedule control process
    are the following:
         The schedule management plan. This plan specifies how to monitor and control
         the project at hand.
         Schedule baseline. This is the approved version of the schedule, against which the
         schedule performance of the project will be measured.
         Performance reports. These reports provide information on the schedule perfor-
         mance of the project, such as missed and met planned dates.
         Approved change requests. These are requests to change the schedule or other
         change requests that will affect the schedule. Approved change requests can update
         the schedule baseline.


    Tools and Techniques for Schedule Control
    The schedule is monitored by progress reporting and performance measurements and is con-
    trolled using the schedule control system. These and other tools and techniques are discussed
    in this section.
    Progress reporting. Progress reports and current schedule status are key items to monitor the
    schedule. They can include the finished activities, the percent of in-progress activities that has
    been completed, and remaining durations for unfinished activities.
    Schedule change control system. This is the system you use to receive, evaluate, and process
    schedule changes. It can include forms, procedures, approval committees, and tracking systems.
222   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       Performance measurement and analysis. The following tools and techniques can be used to
       measure and analyze the schedule performance of the project:
            Performance measurement techniques. These techniques are used to calculate the
            schedule variance and schedule performance index and are discussed in the "Measur-
            ing Performance" section later in this chapter. The schedule variance discussed there
            is in terms of cost, but you can also perform a barebones schedule variance analysis
            based on the start and end dates of the schedule activities.
            Variance analysis. Performing a barebones schedule variance analysis is crucial to
            schedule monitoring because it reveals the deviation of the actual start and finish
            dates from the planned start and finish dates of schedule activities. It might suggest
            corrective actions to be taken to keep the project on track.
            Schedule comparison bar charts. Bar charts can be used to facilitate the schedule
            variance analysis. You can draw two bars corresponding to one schedule activity--
            one bar shows the actual progress, and the other bar shows the expected progress
            according to the baseline. This is a great tool to visually display where the schedule
            has progressed as planned and where it has slipped.



                   TIP
             A schedule variance does not necessarily mean that a schedule change is required.
             For example, a delay on a schedule activity that is not on the critical path might not
             trigger any schedule change.


       Project management software. You can use project management software for scheduling to
       track planned start/finish dates versus actual dates for schedule activities. This software also
       enables you to predict the effects of project schedule changes. These are important pieces of
       information for monitoring and controlling the schedule.

       Schedule performance measurements and recommendations for actions based on the measure-
       ments and progress reports are the important output items of the schedule control process.
       Performance measurements. The results from schedule performance measurements, such as
       the schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI), should be documented and
       communicated to the stakeholders. These measurements might trigger recommendations for
       corrective actions and change requests.
CONTROLLING CHANGES IN COST, SCHEDULE, AND SCOPE                                     Chapter 7         223


    Recommended corrective actions. The goal of schedule-related corrective actions is to bring
    the future schedule performance in line with the schedule baseline--that is, the approved ver-
    sion of the planned schedule. To that end, the following actions can be taken:
         Expedite the execution to ensure that schedule activities are completed on time or
         with minimal delay.
         Perform a root cause analysis to identify the causes of the schedule variance.
         Make plans to recover from the schedule delay.


                TIP
         Remember that corrective actions are not about going back and fixing past mistakes.
         Rather, they're about ensuring that future results match with the plan. You can do this
         by influencing the future results, such as expediting the execution, or by changing the
         plan.


    Updates. The following updates can result from the schedule control process:
         Schedule updates. Schedule changes can happen at the activity level (the start/end
            date of an activity has changed) or at the project level (the start/end date of the pro-
            ject has changed). A schedule change at the project level is called a schedule revision.
            For example, when the schedule scope is expanded, the project end date might have
            to be changed to allow the extra work. All significant schedule changes must be
            reported to the stakeholders.
         Activity updates. The schedule changes and the project progress will cause changes
            in the activity list and in the list of activity attributes. These changes must be docu-
            mented.
         Project management plan. The schedule management plan, a component of the
            project management plan, is updated to reflect the changes that occur during the
            schedule control process.
         Organizational process assets. The lessons learned from the schedule control
            process can be documented to the historical database. Following are some examples:
             The causes of schedule variance
             The reasons for choosing the corrective actions that were taken
             The effectiveness of the corrective actions
            Future projects can make use of this information.
    Change requests. The schedule performance analysis and progress report review can result in
    requests for changes to the project schedule baseline. These changes must be processed through
    the integrated change control process for approval. As with any other change, you must think
224   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       through whether a change to the schedule baseline has any other effect across the project. If it
       does, you might need to update the corresponding component of the project management plan
       accordingly.
       The project schedule is there to execute the project work within the scope of the project. So,
       the project scope must be controlled as well.


   Scope Control
       Controlling the project scope includes influencing factors that create changes to the scope, as
       well as managing change requests and controlling their impact when the change actually occurs.
       While controlling the scope, you focus on the following tasks:
            Watch out for scope creep: Determine whether it has happened and correct the situ-
            ation. Scope creep refers to scope changes applied without processing them though
            the change control process.
            Process the scope change requests through the integrated change control process for
            approval.
            Manage the implementation of scope changes after approval, as well as their impact
            across the project.



                   TIP
             In real life, scope creeps occur for various reasons. For example, perhaps a develop-
             ment engineer thought something was a cool feature to implement, or the customer
             spoke directly with the engineer to make a request for a minor additional feature, or
             various other similar situations. If scope creep has taken your project off track, you
             need to take corrective actions to get the project back on track. You should also inves-
             tigate how the scope creep happened and take steps to prevent it in the future--for
             example, by educating team members about the proper scope change process.


       The obvious input items to the scope control process are the elements that define the scope,
       such as the project scope statement, the scope baseline, the WBS, the WBS dictionary, and a
       scope management plan that describes how to manage the scope. The performance reports
       might help to detect a scope change, and some change requests in other areas can result in scope
       change, as well.
       The main output of the scope control process is the update to scope-related input elements,
       such as the project scope statement, the WBS, the WBS dictionary, and the scope baseline. The
       components of the project management plan affected by these changes might also need to be
       updated. Change requests and recommendations for corrective actions are other obvious out-
       put items from the scope control process.

   The main tools used in the scope control process are the change control system and the pro-
   ject performance analysis, including the scope variance and the schedule variance. Schedule
   variance can have an effect on the scope if you want to finish the project on time and there are
   no additional resources available. The change control system of an organization is a collection
   of formal documented procedures that specify how the project deliverables and documents will
   be changed, controlled, and approved.
   You monitor the project by watching its progress, which is a measure of its performance. There-
   fore, performance measurement and analysis are an important category of tools and techniques
   in monitoring and controlling the project.



Measuring Performance
   Project performance is measured by comparing the project execution against the performance
   measurement baseline, which is an approved integrated plan for scope, schedule, and cost for
   the project, as explained here:
        Cost baseline. This is the planned budget for the project over a time period, used as
        a basis against which to measure, monitor, and control the cost performance of the
        project. The cost performance is measured by comparing the actual cost with the
        planned cost over a time period.
        Schedule baseline. This is a specific version of the project schedule developed from
        the schedule network analysis and the schedule model data, discussed in Chapter 5.
        This is the approved version of the schedule with a start date and an end date, and it
        is used as a basis against which the project schedule performance is measured.
        Scope baseline. This is the approved project scope that includes the approved pro-
        ject scope statement, the WBS based on the approved project scope statement, and
        the corresponding WBS dictionary.
   The elaborate nature of the performance measurement analysis can be seen in the cost control
   process.


Performance Measurement Analysis for Cost Control
   Cost control includes influencing the factors that can create changes to the cost baseline. But
   to detect the arising changes, you need to detect and understand variances from the cost base-
   line by monitoring cost performance.
   In general, variance is a measurable deviation in the value of a project variable (or parameter),
   such as cost or schedule from a known baseline or expected value. Variance analysis is a tech-
   nique used to assess the magnitude of variation in the value of a variable, such as cost from the
   baseline or expected value, determine the cause of the variance, and decide whether a correc-
   tive action is required. A common technique to assess the cost variance is called the earned value
226   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       technique (EVT); in this technique you calculate the cumulative value of the budgeted cost of
       work performed in terms of the originally allocated budgeted amount and compare it to the
       following:
         1. Budgeted cost of work scheduled--that is, planned
         2. Actual cost of work performed

       Don't worry if these terms sound confusing right now; I will go through an example soon.
       However, as you will see, the greatest difficulty in understanding EVT stems from the cou-
       pling of cost and schedule. You must realize that the project cost and the project schedule are
       inherently related to each other. Schedule relates to performing certain work over a certain time
       period, whereas cost refers to the money spent to perform the work on a project (or a project
       activity) over a certain period of time. The relationship between cost and schedule can be real-
       ized by understanding that it costs money to perform a schedule activity. The "time is money"
       principle is at work here. For example, a project activity can be looked upon in terms of an
       amount of work that will be needed to complete it or in terms of its monetary value, which will
       include the cost of the work that needs to be performed to complete the activity.
       The EVT involves calculating some variables where you will see the interplay of schedule
       (work) and cost. I will work through an example to help you understand the variables. Assume
       you are a project manager for the construction of a 16-mile road. Further assume that the work
       is uniformly distributed over 12 weeks. The total approved budget for this project is $600,000.
       At the end of first four weeks of work, $125,000 has been spent, and four miles of road have
       been completed.
       I will use this example to perform the cost performance analysis and the schedule performance
       analysis in terms of cost.


       Cost Performance
       Cost performance refers to how efficiently you are spending money on the project work, mea-
       sured against the expectations set in the project management plan--that is, the cost baselines.
       The total cost approved in the baseline is called the budget at completion (BAC).


                    NOTE
             The variables discussed here, such as BAC, EV, and AC, can be calculated either for
             the whole project or for a part of the project, such as a project activity.


       Budget at completion (BAC). This is the total budget authorized for performing the project
       work (or a project activity), also called the planned budget. In other words, it is the cost origi-
       nally estimated in the project management plan. You use this variable in defining almost all
       the following variables. In our example, the value of BAC is $600,000.
                                MEASURING PERFORMANCE                            Chapter 7       227


Earned value (EV) or budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP). This is the value of the
actually performed work expressed in terms of the approved budget for a project or a project
activity for a given time period. In this variable, you see the relationship of schedule (work)
and cost in action. BAC represents the total value of the project. But when you perform some
work on the project, you have earned some of that value, and the earned value is proportional
to the fraction of the total work performed, as shown by the formula here:
        EV = BAC * (work completed / total work required)
So, in our example, EV can be calculated as:
        EV = $600,000 * (4 miles / 16 miles) = $150,000
This is the earned value of the work, which may or may not be equal to the actual money that
you spent to perform this work.
Actual cost (AC) or actual cost of work performed (ACWP). This is the total cost actually
incurred until a specific point on the timescale in performing the work for a project. In our run-
ning example, $125,000 has already been used up to this point. So the actual cost at this point
in time is $125,000. This cost is to be compared with the earned value to calculate the cost vari-
ance and cost performance.
Cost variance (CV). This is a measure of cost performance in terms of deviation of reality from
the plan, and is obtained by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the earned value (EV), as
shown in the formula here:
        CV = EV - AC
So, in our example, CV can be calculated as shown here:
        CV = $150,000 - $125,000 = $25,000
The expected value of CV is zero because we expect the earned value to be equal to the actual
cost. The positive result indicates better cost performance than expected, whereas a negative
result indicates worse cost performance than expected. Deviation is one way of comparison,
and ratio is another.
Cost performance index (CPI). Earned value represents the portion of the work completed,
and actual cost represents the money spent. So, the CPI indicates whether you are getting a
fair value for your money. This is a measure of cost efficiency of a project calculated by divid-
ing earned value (EV) by actual cost (AC), as shown in the formula here:
        CPI = EV / AC
So, the CPI for our example can be calculated as:
        CPI = $150,000 / $125,000 = 1.2
This means you are getting $1.20 worth of performance for every dollar spent. A value of CPI
greater than one indicates good performance, whereas a value less than one indicates bad per-
formance. The expected value of CPI is one.
228   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       So both the CV and the CPI indicate that you are getting more value for each dollar spent.
       Hold back a little before opening the champagne, though. If you read the text of our example
       again, note that four out of 12 weeks have already passed, and only four out of 16 miles of road
       have been built. That means that only one-fourth of the work has been accomplished in one-
       third of the total scheduled time. This means we are lagging behind in our schedule. Although
       cost performance is good, schedule performance needs to be investigated, too.


       Schedule Performance in Terms of Cost
       Schedule performance refers to how efficiently you are executing your project schedule as mea-
       sured against the expectations set in the project management plan. It can be measured by com-
       paring the earned value to the planned value, just like cost performance is measured by
       comparing the earned value to the actual cost. Planned value refers to the value that we planned
       to create in the time spent so far.
       Planned value (PV) or budgeted cost for the work scheduled (BCWS). This is the autho-
       rized cost for the scheduled work on the project or a project activity up to a given point on the
       timescale. The planned value is also called the budgeted cost for the work scheduled (BCWS). PV
       is basically how much you were authorized to spend in the fraction of schedule time spent so
       far, as shown in the formula here:
               PV = BAC * (time passed / total schedule time)
       Therefore, the planned value for the project in our example at the end of first four weeks is cal-
       culated as shown here:
               PV = $600,000 * (4 weeks / 12 weeks) = $200, 000
       So, PV represents the planned schedule in terms of cost. You can calculate the schedule per-
       formance by comparing the planned schedule to the performed schedule in terms of cost.
       Schedule variance (SV ). This is the deviation of the performed schedule from the
       planned schedule in terms of cost. No confusion is allowed here because you already know that
       the schedule can be translated to cost. SV is calculated as the difference between EV and PV,
       as shown in the formula here:
               SV = EV - PV
       So, the SV in our example can be calculated as:
               SV = $150,000 - $200, 000 = -$50,000
       The negative value means we are behind schedule. Deviation represented by schedule variance
       is one way of comparison, and ratio represented by schedule performance index is another.
       Schedule performance index (SPI). Earned value represents the portion of work completed
       in terms of cost, and planned value represents how much work was planned by this point in
       time in terms of cost. So, the SPI indicates how the performed work compared to the planned
                                MEASURING PERFORMANCE                              Chapter 7       229


work. This is a measure of the schedule efficiency of a project calculated by dividing earned
value (EV) by planned value (PV), as shown in the formula here:
        SPI = EV / PV
So, the SPI for our example can be calculated as shown here:
        SPI = $150,000 / $200, 000 = 0.75
This indicates that the project is progressing at 75% of the planned pace--not good.
You should note that all these performance variables except the BAC are calculated at a given
point in time. As shown in Figure 7.8, you can maintain a graphic that presents the values of
these variables against points in time as the project progresses. Note that the value of the BAC
does not change with time because it is the cost at completion time. Further note that given
the BAC, the PV can be calculated at any point in time, even before the project execution starts.
EV and EC are accumulated as the project execution progresses.
By using the variables discussed so far, you can monitor the project performance as the time
progresses. Not only that, you can also make predictions about the future performance based
on the past performance.

                  variable BAC is independent of time.
230   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       Forecasting Techniques
       Forecasting refers to predicting some information about the project in the future based on the
       performance in the past. The forecasting is regularly updated as the project progresses and more
       data of the past performance becomes available.
       Estimate to complete (ETC). This is the prediction about the expected cost to complete the
       remaining work for the project or for a project activity. This is basically how much value remains
       to be earned in terms of the BAC. Therefore, the value of the ETC is obtained by subtracting
       the earned value (EV) from the budget at completion (BAC), as shown in the formula here:
               ETC = BAC - EV
       So, in our example, the value of ETC can be calculated as:
               ETC = $600,000 - $150,000 = $450,000
       The next question that can be asked about the future is how much it will cost to complete the
       whole project.
       Estimate at completion (EAC). This is the estimate made at the current point in time for
       how much it will cost to complete the project or a project activity. The value of the EAC is
       obtained by adding the value of ETC to AC, as shown in the formula here:
               EAC = ETC + AC
       Accordingly, the value of EAC for our example can be calculated as:
               EAC = $450,000 + $125,000 = $575,000
       Another useful prediction to be made is how much performance you need in the future to
       complete the remaining work within budget.
       To complete performance index (TCPI). This is the variable to predict the future performance
       needed to finish the work within budget. It is calculated as the ratio of the remaining work to
       the remaining budget, as shown in the formula here:
               TCPI = Remaining work % Remaining funds = (BAC - BCWP) % (BAC -
               ACWP) = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
       Therefore, the value of TCPI in our example can be calculated as:
               TCPI = ($600,000 - $150,000) / ($600,000 - $125,000) = 450,000 / 475,000 =
               0.95 = 95 %.
       Table 7.3 summarizes all these performance variables.
       So, during the executing stage, the obvious items that need to be executed are the schedule
       activities, and while these activities are being executed, the attached cost, schedule, and scope
       need to be monitored and controlled. However, there is another important component of the
       project that needs to be monitored and controlled--the risk.

   Monitoring and Controlling Risks
       The project management plan contains the list of risks you identified during risk planning and
       the responses you will execute if the risks occur. You must actively monitor the identified risks
       and identify and respond to the new risks as they appear. The risk monitoring and controlling
       process is used to monitor and control risks and includes the following goals:
            Tracking identified risks
            Monitoring residual risks (the risks that remain after risk responses have been
            implemented)
            Identifying new risks and preparing responses for them
            Executing the risk plan and evaluating its effectiveness
       Figure 7.9 shows the risk monitoring and controlling process.




           FIGURE 7.9 The risk monitoring and controlling process: input, tools and techniques, and output

       To monitor and control risks, you must have a list of identified risks, a plan to deal with the
       risks, and the signs of risk occurrence. Accordingly, the input items to risk monitoring and con-
       trolling are risk management plans, risk registers, approved change requests, and work perfor-
       mance information. These items were discussed in Chapter 4. The tools and techniques to risk
       monitoring and the output from it are discussed in the following sections.


   Tools and Techniques for Risk Monitoring and Controlling
       There are some tools and techniques available to detect risk triggers, to respond effectively to
       the risks that have occurred, and to identify new risks.
               MONITORING AND CONTROLLING RISKS                                  Chapter 7       233


Risk audits. A risk audit is conducted to examine the following:
     Root causes of the identified risks
     Effectiveness of responses to the identified risks
     Effectiveness of the risk management processes
Risk reassessment. The risks should be continually reassessed as the project progresses. For
example, a risk on the watch list might become important enough that you might need to pre-
pare a response plan for it.
Risk analyses. Risk analyses are necessary to effectively respond to the risks that have occurred,
to detect the risk triggers, and to identify new risks. The following two kinds of analyses are
appropriate for risk monitoring:
     Variance and trend analysis. Trends in the project performance should be reviewed
     on a regular basis as the project execution progresses. These trends can be deter-
     mined by analyzing the performance data based on various performance control
     techniques, such as variance and earned value analysis, discussed earlier in this
     chapter. This analysis can help in detecting new risks.
     Reserve analysis. Recall that the contingency reserve is the amount of funds or time
     (in the schedule) in addition to the planned budget reserved to keep the impact of
     risks to an acceptable level when the project is executing. The risks occurring during
     the project execution can have positive or negative effects on contingency reserve.
     You perform the reserve analysis at a given time to compare the remaining reserve
     amount to the remaining risk to determine whether the remaining reserve amount is
     adequate.
Technical performance measurement. Technical performance measurements compare actual
versus planned parameters related to the overall technical progress of the project. The devia-
tion determines the degree to which system requirements are met in terms of performance, cost,
schedule, and progress in implementing risk handling. The parameters chosen to measure tech-
nical performance could be any parameters that represent something important related to the
project objectives and requirements; software performance, human resource performance, and
system test performance are some examples.
Status meetings. You should always put risk management as an agenda item at project status
meetings. The time spent on this item will depend on the number of identified risks, their pri-
orities, and the complexity of the responses planned for them. Nevertheless, keeping risk on
your agenda and discussing risks with the team on a regular basis help make risk management
smoother and more effective.
These tools and techniques are used to monitor the risks that might generate recommenda-
tions for actions, which are part of the output of the risk monitoring and controlling processes.
234   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


   Output from Risk Monitoring and Controlling
       The output of monitoring risks includes recommendations for actions and requests for changes
       to control the risks. These and other output items are discussed in the following list.
       Recommended actions. There are two kinds of actions recommended as a result of risk mon-
       itoring: corrective actions and preventive actions. Corrective actions include contingency plans
       and workaround plans. A workaround is a response to a negative risk that has occurred. A
       workaround is based on a quick solution and is not planned in advance of the risk occurrence
       event. Preventive actions are recommended to bring the project into compliance with the pro-
       ject management plan. Recommended corrective and preventive actions are input to the inte-
       grated change control process.
       Updates. The risk monitoring and controlling processes might require updates to the follow-
       ing items:
            Risk register. You might need to include the following updates to the risk register:
             Outcomes of risk reassessments, risk reviews, and risk audits
             Outcomes of risks and responses to risks
            Project management plan. The project management plan might need to be updated
            as a result of risk monitoring and controlling. For example, the change requests
            might change the risk management processes, which in turn will change the project
            management plan.
            Organizational process assets. As a result of the risk monitoring and controlling
            processes, some organizational process assets might need to be updated, such as tem-
            plates for the project management plan, the historical information database, for such
            information as actual costs and durations of project activities, the lessons-learned
            knowledge database, and checklists.
       Change requests. You will need to make some change requests as a result of risk monitoring
       and controlling. For example, recommended actions, such as contingency plans and
       workarounds, might result in requirements to change some elements of the project manage-
       ment plan to respond to certain risks. Of course, the change requests will need to go through
       the integrated change control process for approval, and the approved change requests will
       become the input to the direct and manage project execution process for implementation.
       Figure 7.10 shows the big picture of monitoring and controlling the project. The recommended
       actions and change requests from the monitoring processes as a result of monitoring the pro-
       ject go through the integrated change control process for approval. If approved, the execution
       of these actions and changes is managed using direct and manage project execution, a process
       in the executing process group.
                                                            SUMMARY               Chapter 7       235




      FIGURE 7.10 The big picture of monitoring and controlling a project

  The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
       A project is monitored by continually measuring its performance as it progresses.
       Based on the performance measurements, actions can be recommended and changes
          can be requested to control the project and thereby bring it in line with the project
          management plan. These actions and changes are processed through the integrated
          change control process for approval and, if approved, their execution is managed
          using the direct and manage project execution process.
       The risk monitoring and controlling processes are used to monitor and control the
          identified risks and to look out for new risks.



Summary
  You need to monitor and control your project throughout its lifecycle, which includes moni-
  toring and controlling performance, changes, and risks. Change requests might arise from the
  evaluation of performance results to bring the performance in line with the project manage-
  ment plan, or they might originate from other sources, such as project stakeholders. Regard-
  less of their origin, all change requests must go through the integrated change control process,
  which will approve them or reject them.
236   Chapter 7     MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECTS


       In an ideal world, there should be no changes to or variations from the planned baselines, such
       as cost, schedule, and scope baselines. A good-quality project is completed within the planned
       cost, schedule, and scope. However, in the real world, there are changes and variations, and
       therefore quality needs to be monitored and controlled, which involves monitoring certain
       project results by making measurements and taking actions based on those measurements.
       The three project parameters--cost, scope, and schedule--are collectively known as a triple
       constraint because if one of them changes, at least one of the other two parameters must change.
       Therefore, project monitoring and controlling includes monitoring and controlling these three
       parameters, which involves measuring cost, schedule, and scope performance and taking actions
       based on performance. The most commonly used technique to measure cost and schedule per-
       formance is known as the earned value technique (EVT), and it measures the performance by
       comparing the earned value of the actual work performed to the actual cost and to the planned
       value that was supposed to be earned according to the plan. In addition to monitoring and
       controlling the cost, schedule, and scope of the project work, you also need to monitor and con-
       trol the identified risks and watch out for new risks that might appear. The recommendations
       for actions and change requests from monitoring and controlling the project go through the
       integrated change control process for approval and, if approved, go though the direct and
       manage project execution process for implementation.
       After the execution of the last schedule activity is complete, you are not done yet. You need to
       give a proper closure to the project, which is the topic I discuss in the next chapter.


       Exam's Eye View
        Comprehend

         You monitor and control the project by monitoring and controlling project performance,
            changes, and risks.

         All the individual control processes, such as risk control and quality control, can generate
            change requests and recommended actions, which must be processed through the integrated
            change control process, in which each of these requests and recommendations will either be
            rejected or approved.

         The approved change requests and recommendations for actions will be processed through the
            direct and manage project execution process for implementation.

         The three project parameters--cost, schedule, and scope--form a triple constraint, which
            means if one of these three parameters changes, at least one of the other two must change.

   Look Out

    Cost variance (CV) is calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the earned value
      (EV), and not from the planned value (PV).

    Schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are calculated in terms of cost:
      EV and PV.

    It is possible for CV and SV to run in opposite directions--for example, CV has a positive
      value when SV has a negative value.

   Memorize

    For cost performance analysis:
      EV = BAC * (Work completed / Total work required)
      CV = EV - AC
      CPI = EV / AC

    For schedule performance analysis:
      PV = BAC * (Time passed / Total schedule time)
      SV = EV - PV
      SPI = EV / PV




Key Terms
       actual cost (AC). The total cost actually incurred until a specific point on the
          timescale in performing the work for a project or a project activity.

              project start date, end date, or both.
              scope baseline. The approved project scope, which includes the approved project
              scope statement, the WBS based on the approved project scope statement, and the

              a known baseline or expected value.
              variance analysis. A technique used to assess the magnitude of variation in the value
              of a variable (such as cost from the baseline or expected value), determine the cause
              of the variance, and decide whether a corrective action is required.
              workaround. A response to a negative risk that has occurred. A workaround is based
              on a quick solution and is not planned in advance of the risk occurrence event.

                          the approved changes that were supposed to be
                          implemented.

      he last deliverable on the project schedule has been completed. However, put that cham-
  T   pagne bottle back into the refrigerator; the project has not ended yet. It has just reached
  another stage called the project closing stage, and, as a project manager, you need to continue
  monitoring and controlling the project through this stage. Also, recall that there are two kinds
  of project work--in-house and procured. The procured work involves some kind of legal
  agreement, such as a contract. Accordingly, there are two components of project closure--the
  work-related closure, called administrative closure, and the contract closure called, well, contract
  closure. So that nothing falls between the cracks, you should establish procedures to perform
  both of these closures.
  The main issue in this chapter is project closure. To enable you to wrap your arms around
  this issue, we will explore three avenues--administrative closure, contract closure, and closure
  procedures.



Understanding Project Closure
  Project closure refers to a set of tasks that are required to formally end the project. There are
  two kinds of projects that you need to close formally:
       Completed projects. A project that has met its completion criteria falls into this
          category.
       Terminated projects. A project that was terminated before its completion falls into
          this category. A project can be terminated at various stages for various reasons. Fol-
          lowing are some examples:
           The project management plan is not approved for whatever reason.
           The project has been executing but you have run out of resources, and no more
              resources are available.
           The project has been cancelled because it was going nowhere.
           The project has been indefinitely postponed because there is not a large enough
              market for the product it would produce.


               NOTE
        The processes of the closing process group can be used to close a project, as well
        as to close a phase of a project.
246   Chapter 8     CLOSING THE PROJECT


       The process of closure consists of two kinds of tasks:
            Establish procedures to coordinate the activities needed to close the project.
            Implement the procedures.
       There are two aspects of closing a project--administrative closure and contract closure. As
       described in the following list, you define the procedures for carrying out both aspects of the
       project closure.
            Administrative closure procedure. Performing administrative closure of a project
            includes obtaining final acceptance for the project deliverables, analyzing the pro-
            ject's success or failure, gathering lessons learned, archiving project information, and
            releasing project resources. How will these activities be performed and coordinated,
            and by whom? For that, you establish an administrative closure procedure for your
            project that will take into account the relevant policies and procedures of the per-
            forming organization.
            Contract closure procedure. Contract closure includes settling and closing all the
            contracts associated with the project. To carry out and coordinate the activities
            needed for the contract closure, you define the contract closure procedure.
       These procedures are defined and implemented using the processes in the closing process
       group. This process group contains the following two processes:
            The close project process. This is the process used to finalize all activities across all
            of the process groups to formally close the project. It's also used to establish the pro-
            cedures for administrative and contract closures.
            The contract closure process. This is the process used to complete and settle each
            contract, which includes resolving any open item and closing each contract applica-
            ble to the project.
       The relationship between these two processes is shown in Figure 8.1. The procedures for
       administrative and contract closure are established by using the close project process.

Performing Project Closure
   A project is closed using two processes in the closing process group--close process and con-
   tract closure. The close project process is used to close the project work portion of the project
   (as opposed to the contract portion). This includes finalizing all activities completed across all
   process groups to formally close the project. Figure 8.2 shows the close project process.




       FIGURE 8.2 The close project process: input, tools and techniques, and output



                TIP
         It is the project sponsor who signs the final project closure documents. The sponsor
         can also authorize the closure of the project at any stage.


   The items that describe what the project was planned to deliver and what it has delivered are
   the obvious input to the close project process.


Input to the Close Project Process
   You need a list of project deliverables that will go through the acceptance procedure. The pro-
   ject management plan contains guidelines on how to close the project. These and other input
   items are discussed in the following list:
        Project management plan. This defines how to close this project and will be useful
        in establishing the project closure procedure.
        Deliverables. These will need to go through the acceptance procedure.
248   Chapter 8     CLOSING THE PROJECT


            Work performance information. This has the important information for the project
            closure, such as deliverables that have been completed, the extent to which the qual-
            ity standards have been met, authorized and incurred costs, lessons learned, and the
            like.
            Contract documentation. This is needed to establish the contract closure procedure.
            Organizational process assets. These can include project closure guidelines or
            requirements--for example, product validation and acceptance criteria, final project
            audits, and project evaluations.
            Enterprise environmental factors. These include tools, such as a project manage-
            ment information system used to perform tasks involved in closing the project, such
            as updating the lessons learned database.
       These input items provide information about what the project was supposed to deliver and
       what it has delivered. You use this input and some tools and techniques to carry on the project
       closure.


   Tools and Techniques for the Close Project Process
       The tools and techniques available to develop and implement the project closure procedures
       are discussed in the following list:
            Project management methodology. This is used to define a process (or set of
            processes) that will help the project management team execute both the administra-
            tive and the contract closure procedures for the project.
            Project management information system. This system, owned by the performing
            organization, can include tools that will help the project management team perform
            the administrative and contract closure of the project.
            Expert judgment. Help from relevant experts can be used to both develop and
               implement the closure procedures.
       You use these tools to carry on the project closure.



                    TIP
             Although the fundamental project processes are the same for each organization, the
             manners in which they are implemented might be different for different organizations.
             Each organization can have its own project management methodology that consists
             of items such as detailed steps for how to carry on the project processes, templates,
             meetings, and procedures. However, the name "project management methodology,"
             given to this tool/technique used for various processes in the PMBOK, might be con-
             fusing for some folks for whom the whole PMBOK is the project management
             methodology.

Output of the Close Project Process
   The output of the close project process contains three kinds of elements--closing procedures,
   acceptance of the project deliverables by the customer, and archival of project-related docu-
   ments. These elements are described in this section.
   Administrative closure procedure. This procedure specifies the step-by-step methodology
   for the administrative closure of the project, which includes specifying all the necessary activ-
   ities, roles, and responsibilities of the project team members who will participate in the closure
   process. The activities defined by this procedure include the following:
        Activities to define the requirements for getting approval from the stakeholders, such
        as customers and the sponsor on the project deliverables, and the approved changes
        which were supposed to be implemented
        Activities that are necessary to satisfy the project completion or exit criteria
        Activities related to the project completion, such as:
         Confirm that the project has met all requirements
         Verify that all deliverables have been provided and accepted
         Verify that the completion or exit criteria have been met
   Formal acceptance for the final product. This includes handing over the final product to the
   customer and getting formal acceptance for it--for example, in the form of a receipt that con-
   tains a formal statement to the effect that the requirements of the project have been met,
   including the terms of the contracts.
   Updates to organizational process assets. The closure process will add the following docu-
   ments to the organizational process assets:
        Acceptance documentation. This is the documentation that proves that the fulfill-
        ment of the project requirements have been confirmed, completion of the project has
        been verified, and the product has been formally accepted by the customer. In the
        case of a project termination, of course, the documentation should show that the exit
        criteria have been met.
        Project closure documentation. In addition to the acceptance documentation, you
        should also archive the other project closure documents, such as the closure proce-
        dure and the handing-over of project deliverables to an operation group. If the pro-
        ject was terminated, then the formal documentation indicating why the project was
        terminated should be included in the archive.
        Project files archive. This includes the documents from the project's lifecycle, such
        as the project management plan, risk registers, planned risk responses, and baselines
        for cost, schedule, scope, and quality.
        Lessons-learned database. The documentation on lessons learned should be saved
        in the organization's knowledge database so that future projects can benefit from it.
250   Chapter 8     CLOSING THE PROJECT


       Contract closure procedure. This procedure is developed to formally close all contracts asso-
       ciated with the project. It specifies a step-by-step methodology to execute activities needed to
       close the contracts. The roles and responsibilities of the team members who will be involved
       in the closure process are also specified.


                    NOTE
             A procedure and a process are not the same thing. For example, the administrative
             closure procedure and contract closure procedure are two of several output items of
             the close project process.


       The contract closure procedure established by using the close project process becomes an input
       item to the contract closure process.



   Performing Contract Closure
       A project might include work that was procured, and that's where legal agreements, such as
       contracts, come into the picture. The contracts are closed at the end of a project or a phase by
       using the contract closure process. Strictly speaking, the contract closure process is used to
       accomplish the following two goals:
            Close all the contracts applicable to the project.
            Receive verification (if you are a seller) or issue verification (if you are a buyer) that
               all the procured deliverables were received and accepted. In this respect, the contract
               closure process supports the administrative closure of the project.
       If the project terminates without completion, you still need to go through the contract closure
       process, if there is a contract. Usually a contract contains the contract termination clause, which
       contains the terms of the project termination, including the rights and responsibilities of the
       parties in case of the project's early termination.
       Figure 8.3 shows the contract closure process.The contract closure procedure that you estab-
       lished in the close project process becomes an input item to the contract closure process.


   Input to the Contract Closure Process
       The input items to the contract closure process are what you need to close the contract. They
       are discussed in the following list:
            Contract closure procedure. This is needed to close the contract in an effective
            manner.
            Contract management plan. This contains the requirements for formal contract
            closure.

       FIGURE 8.3 The contract closure process: input, tools and techniques, and output

        Contract documentation. This is obviously needed to close the contract.
        Procurement management plan. This is needed to check whether the procurement
           requirements are met; it might have some procedures that you need to follow during
           closure.
   You implement the contract closure procedure by using the available tools and techniques, dis-
   cussed in the next section.


Tools and Techniques for the Contract Closure Process
   The tools and techniques for the contract closure process are the items you need to facilitate
   the contract closure. They are discussed in this section.
   Procurement audits. This is a structured review of the procurement process with the purpose
   of identifying successes and failures from the planning through the executing stage of the pro-
   ject. The lessons learned from the audit can be applied to other phases of the same project (if
   it is a phase closeout) or to other projects within the same performing organization.
   Records management system. This is a part of the project management information system
   and can be used to manage contract documentation and records. For example, you can use this
   system to archive documents, maintain an index of contract and communication documents,
   and retrieve documents.
   Now, I'll ask you the easiest question in this book: What is the output of the contract closure
   process?


Output of the Contract Closure Process
   Yes, you are right. The output of the contract closure process is the closed contract. But you
   also need to get the acceptance notice and save some documents, as discussed in this section.
252   Chapter 8     CLOSING THE PROJECT


       Closed contracts. Closing the contract means the procured work is completed with all its
       requirements and is accepted. Generally, it is accomplished by a formal notice from the buyer
       to the seller, which might come, for example, through the buyer's authorized administrator. The
       requirements for the formal contract closure are usually defined in the terms of the contract
       and are included in the contract management plan, an input item to the contract closure
       process.
       Updates to organizational process assets. The following items should be added to the orga-
       nizational process assets:
            Contract documentation, including the closed contract with the closure notice
            Acceptance of deliverables through a notice from the buyer to the seller, notifying
            that the procurement deliverables have been accepted
            Lessons learned from this procurement that can be used in the future projects
       Note that the contract closure process supports the close project process in the sense that it
       includes the administrative activities, such as acceptance of (procured) deliverables and addi-
       tions to the documentation archive, including the lessons learned database.
       Some elements of the administrative closure demand a closer look.



   The Finishing Touch
       Reviewing the project, releasing the project resources, and turning over the project deliverables
       to another group are the elements of the administrative closure that need to be explored fur-
       ther.


   Reviewing the Project
       Part of the administrative closure is to analyze project success or failure. You can accomplish
       this by collecting and generating the project evaluation information, such as what went well
       and what did not. Some of this information already exists in the work performance (status)
       reports. However, the final information can be gathered in various ways, such as a post-project
       review meeting with the team or a questionnaire. The most important output (and the whole
       purpose) of the review are the lessons learned. The review should be comprehensive and
       should cover the following:
            Both the technical and non-technical components
            Both positive and negative aspects--that is, the things that went well and the things
            that did not go well
            All stages and phases of the project
                                            THE FINISHING TOUCH                     Chapter 8       253



                TIP
         The purpose of the post-project review, also called the post-project assessment, is to
         learn lessons that can be applied to future projects to run them more effectively. Do
         not let the review turn into a finger-pointing show.


   As part of the project review, you should also measure customer satisfaction from the customer
   feedback collected by using techniques such as interviews and surveys. This will help the orga-
   nization establish and maintain a long-term relationship with the customer.
   The findings of the review should be recorded in a document that might have different names
   in different organizations, such as the post-project review report or the project assessment
   report. Your organization might even have a template or standard for such a report. Depend-
   ing upon the size of the project, the review report might be a part of the project closure report
   or a separate report. The report will be distributed among the stakeholders and will be added
   to the project archive. The project closure report can also include the final project performance
   as compared to the baselines, as well as a description of the final project product.


Releasing the Resources
   For the effective and efficient use of the organization's resources, it is imperative that they be
   released in an efficient and proper manner. The release procedure might be included in the
   resource planning--for example, the staff management plan should address the issue of releas-
   ing the human resources. Well-planned release or transfer of team members reflects manage-
   rial professionalism, which requires that employees be treated with respect and dignity. By
   ensuring a well-planned release and a smooth transition to other projects, you are helping the
   employees focus wholeheartedly on the project toward the very end, rather than worrying about
   the next assignment. This will obviously improve the productivity of the team members and
   the efficiency of the project. Following are some suggestions to consider for properly releasing
   the human resources:
        Although it is possible that different team members will be released at different
        times, at the project closure you should organize some closure event to honor and
        thank the project team members, including the contractors, for their contributions.
        However, you must check your company policy regarding including the contractors
        in company-sponsored events and giving them rewards.
        Plan ahead, and do not wait until the last minute. Communicate with the functional
        manager ahead of time about when a staff member is going to be released.
        Work closely with your organization's human resources department, which might
        have some guidelines or procedure that you need to follow.
        Write (or offer to write) recommendation letters for team members who have made
        outstanding contributions to the project.
254   Chapter 8     CLOSING THE PROJECT


       Once all the closure tasks are completed and the documents are finalized, the project might
       need to be turned over to another group in the organization--for example, to the maintenance
       or operations group.


   Saying Goodbye: The Project Turnover
       Depending upon the project, you might need to coordinate the turnover of the project deliv-
       erables to another group, such as a maintenance or operations group. The turnover require-
       ments, such as training the help-desk employees, should have been included in the project
       management plan.
       The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
            The administrative closure refers to closing the work part of the project, and it
            includes obtaining product acceptance, compiling project records, reviewing the pro-
            ject for lessons learned, and archiving all this information so future projects can ben-
            efit from it.
            Contract closure refers to closing all the contracts applicable to the project; it is per-
            formed using the contract closure process.
            The administrative closure procedure and the contract closure procedure are both
            established using the close project process.



   Summary
       All projects, big or small, terminated or completed, should go through the closure stage, which
       involves administrative closure and contract closure. The administrative closure accomplishes
       closure of the work portion of the project and includes obtaining final acceptance for the pro-
       ject deliverables, analyzing the project's success or failure, gathering lessons learned, archiving
       project information, and releasing project resources. The contract closure includes settling and
       closing all the contracts associated with the project.
       You use the close project process to perform the administrative closure as well as to establish
       the procedures for the administrative and contract closures. The contract closure process is used
       to close the contracts associated with the project.
       Like every other profession, project management has its integrity and ethics that you need to
       uphold. You'll explore this topic in the next chapter.
                                                              SUMMARY               Chapter 8        255


Exam's Eye View
Comprehend

 You, the project manager, manage the project closure. You can even recommend the project
    closure to the project sponsor--for example, if you run out of resources and no more resources
    are available, but the authorization for the project closure must come from the sponsor.

 The project, in general, can have two kinds of work--in-house and procured. Accordingly
    there are two components of closure--administrative closure and contract closure.

 The contract closure process also has some administrative closure elements, such as acceptance
    of the (procured) product and additions to the documents archive and the lessons-learned
    database.

Look Out

 Not only the completed projects, but also the terminated projects, should be formally closed
    using the processes of the closing process group.

 Administrative closure procedure is an output of the close project process, not an input to it.
 The contact closure procedure is the output of the close project process, not of the contract
    closure process. However, it is an input into the contract closure process.

Memorize

 The project sponsor signs the final project closure documents. The sponsor can also authorize
    the closure of the project at any stage.

 The product acceptance is carried out using the close project process.
 The contracts are closed using the contract closure process.
 The contributions to the documentation archive, including the lessons learned database, are
    made by both the close project and the contract closure processes.

   Review Questions
         1. Which of the following scenarios will not trigger the closure stage of the project?
               A. The project plan was not accepted, and therefore the project never went to the

                           professional and cooperative manner by showing respect
                           for personal and cultural differences. For all these objec-
                           tives, you must understand the Project Management
                           Institute PMP Code of Professional Conduct.
      s the name of the certification suggests, you are going to become a project management
  A   professional, if you are not one already. A professional is an individual who practices an
  occupation with professionalism, which is a bond that binds a professional with the code of
  conduct for that occupation.
  Professionalism is not Einstein's theory of relativity. You might need to learn a few things in
  the beginning, but during the course of practicing a profession, professional conduct (that is,
  professionalism) becomes common sense. All professions share the essence of professionalism.
  It is as simple as doing the right thing. As a project manager, remember one golden rule: Deal
  with unprofessional situations directly, openly, and fairly, rather than ignoring them. Profes-
  sionalism starts with individual integrity, which is based on truth, honesty, and openness.
  Therefore, the key question in this chapter is, how can you practice project management with
  professional responsibility? In search of an answer, we will explore three avenues--individual
  integrity, interaction with clients and project stakeholders, and professional competence and
  contribution to the project management knowledge base.



Ensuring Individual Integrity
  Professionalism begins with individual integrity, which is a state of being complete and incor-
  ruptible. You can look at integrity as a point of reference based on truth and honesty, and you
  can maintain your integrity by using this point of reference as a guideline for your behavior
  and decision-making. Integrity identifies you as who you are. If you don't have integrity, peo-
  ple won't know who you really are and they won't trust you. So, individual integrity is a very
  significant part of professionalism in any profession.
  In project management, you maintain your integrity by being honest and truthful everywhere--
  in the PMP exam, as well as while working in the project management field.
  Dealing with the PMP exam and PMI. While going through the process of obtaining PMP
  certification, individual integrity demands that it is your responsibility to adhere to the fol-
  lowing practices:
       While going through the process of obtaining PMP certification, provide accurate
       and true information.
       Maintain the confidentiality of the content of the PMP examination. For example,
       do not disclose the questions in the exam to other PMP candidates.
       Cooperate with PMI concerning any ethical violation and in collecting the related
       information.
              CONTRIBUTING TO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE                                     Chapter 9         261


  The same honesty, truthfulness, and openness that you exhibit during the process of obtaining
  PMP certification also applies while you are working in the field of project management.
  Working in the project management field. The activities that you perform as a PMP include
  representing yourself as a PMP, advertising your organization and your services, and running
  projects. To maintain your individual integrity during these activities, it is your responsibility
  to adhere to the following practices:
       Be accurate and truthful in advertising and representing your qualifications, experi-
          ence, and the services you can perform.
       Be accurate and truthful to the public in advertising and public statements. For
       example, if your project is going to damage the environment, don't say it's going to
       help the environment.
       Maintain and satisfy the scope and objectives of the services promised to the customer.
       Follow the applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards of the city, state, and
       country of your workplace. For example, don't say something like, "This is not how
       we do it back in Texas."
       Neither offer nor accept inappropriate payments in any form, such as gifts, which
       might qualify as bribery.



               TIP
        When you are in a foreign country, sometimes it can be tricky to figure out the right
        thing to do in a given situation. The trick here is if you are being asked to do some-
        thing, such as pay some money to an official for getting something done, that is not
        legal or ethical in your country and culture, first investigate whether it is legal and eth-
        ical in the country you are in now. If you find it to be illegal and unethical there as
        well, but you are told it's a common practice, do not do it.


  As you practice project management, you will learn lessons you can share with the community
  of project managers--that is, you can contribute to the project management knowledge base.



Contributing to the Knowledge Base
  Professionalism demands (or encourages) that project managers (or PMPs) contribute to the
  project management knowledge base by publishing, teaching, and sharing lessons learned dur-
  ing practice.
262   Chapter 9    PERFORMING PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY


       While doing so, you should adhere to the following practices:
            Share the information in an accurate, truthful, and complete manner.
            Recognize and honor the intellectual property developed or owned by others, and
            give credit where credit is due when you use it.
            Follow the PMP Code of Professional Conduct and disseminate it among the PMP
            community.



                   TIP
             PMI expects a PMP to stay engaged and help advance the project management pro-
             fession by completing tasks such as contributing to the knowledge base. So partici-
             pating in project management training, mentoring, sharing lessons learned, and
             promoting best practices are all recommendations by PMI that might appear in some
             exam questions, even if you think they have nothing to do with running projects.


       Contributing to the knowledge base is one side of the coin; the other side is obtaining the
       knowledge, or enhancing your individual professional competence.



   Enhancing Individual Professional
   Competence
       Professionalism in project management, as in any other field, demands that while practicing
       your profession you continue to learn and grow professionally. This is important for your indi-
       vidual success and for the advancement of the profession.
       Project management is a very involved and growing field. PMP certification and this book
       only introduce you to the field. For example, you can focus on any of the nine knowledge areas,
       such as risk management or quality management, and explore it further. Exploring the exist-
       ing dimensions further is one area of learning, and adding new dimensions is another. For
       example, how about managing virtual teams--that is, teams that are spread out geographi-
       cally? This new dimension in project management is quickly becoming an important and inte-
       gral part of the project management profession, even faster than PMI can digest.
       Exploring existing dimensions further and practicing new dimensions enhances your individ-
       ual professional competence, as well as enables you to contribute to the knowledge base.
       Working in the field will also expose your professional weaknesses, which you will need to work
       on. This is also an integral part of enhancing your individual professional competence.
   GETTING IT STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH                                         Chapter 9       263


  Whether you are enhancing your individual professional competence or contributing to the
  knowledge base, you are interacting with other members of your professional community.
  During the course of a project, the most important interaction is the interaction among the
  project stakeholders.


Promoting Interaction among
Stakeholders
  A project manager needs to have a host of skills, and all of them are important. However, if I'm
  forced to name the most important skill a project manager has and the most important activity
  a project manager should perform, the answer would be communication. On that note, as a pro-
  ject manager, it is your responsibility to facilitate interaction among the project stakeholders. You
  use communication for various purposes, such as to keep everybody on the same page regard-
  ing the status and issues of the project so there is no confusion or misunderstanding.
  While dealing with stakeholders and facilitating interaction among them, professionalism
  demands that you adhere to the following practices:
       Treat the stakeholder with respect and show respect for cultural diversity.
       Be accurate and truthful when presenting services and preparing estimates for costs
       and expected results.
       Be open and honest in your dealings with stakeholders, especially when you are
       resolving an issue.
       Honor confidentiality for the information you collect during your interactions with
       stakeholders.
       Disclose to stakeholders (clients, customers, owners, or contractors) significant cir-
       cumstances that could be construed as conflicts of interest. It is your responsibility to
       ensure that a conflict of interest does not compromise the legitimate interests of a
       stakeholder and does not influence your professional judgments.
  The material in this chapter is largely based on the PMP Code of Professional Conduct state-
  ment by PMI.


Getting It Straight from the
Horse's Mouth
  The PMI's philosophy on professional responsibility is not covered in the project management
  book of knowledge (PMBOK). However, you sign the PMP Code of Professional Conduct
  statement by PMI when you apply to take the PMP exam. I recommend that you study this
  statement carefully because most of the questions based on this topic will be directly or indi-
  rectly based on this statement. The statement is presented here in its entirety.

266   Chapter 9     PERFORMING PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY



   Dealing with Unprofessional Conduct
       Working as a project manager, you will encounter minor to serious unprofessional conduct from
       time to time. The key here is, again, to be honest, truthful, and open.


                    TIP
             You might encounter small ethical violations, which might be painful to resolve. How-
             ever, as a professional, you should choose to address them instead of ignoring them,
             and you should address them openly, fairly, and in a timely fashion.


       As you already know, we live in a world of duality--good and bad, pleasure and pain, profes-
       sionalism and unprofessionalism, and the like, all living side by side. Scary! However, if you
       stick to your professionalism, then you do not need to be afraid of a lack of professionalism in
       others. Do not focus on the person; focus on the conduct and remember that the only weapon
       you have to defeat a lack of professionalism is professionalism. If you are unprofessional, you
       cannot defeat a lack of professionalism; you can only promote it.
       So, when you encounter a lack of professionalism, stay professional, focus on the issue and not
       on the person, maintain a smile on your face, and deal with the situation honestly, openly, and
       truthfully.
       The three most important takeaways from this chapter are as follows:
            You should practice your profession with professionalism, supported by individual
            integrity based on honesty, truthfulness, and openness.
            You should interact with your clients and project stakeholders with respect, truthful-
            ness, and openness. Show your respect to diversity in cultures, and follow the law of
            the land for your workplace.
            You should continue enhancing your professional competence and contributing to
            the project management knowledge base.


   Summary
       As a PMP, you must practice project management with professionalism--that is, with profes-
       sional responsibility--which includes following the rules and policies of the certification process
       and of the organization for which you are managing the project. The key to professionalism is
       individual integrity based on honesty, truth, and openness. Professionalism requires that you
       interact with your client and with the project stakeholders with mutual dignity and respect,
       and show respect to diversity of cultures and beliefs. If you encounter an unprofessional situa-
       tion, rather than ignoring it, you deal with it honestly, openly, and truthfully. Your professional
       responsibility as a PMP also demands that you continue enhancing your professional compe-
       tence and contributing to the project management knowledge base.
                                                               SUMMARY                  Chapter 9       267


Keep in mind that while honesty, truth, and openness are essential elements of individual
integrity regardless of where you are, the definitions of right versus wrong, acceptable versus
unacceptable, and to some extent ethical versus unethical might vary across cultures. Some-
times you will need to think hard to do the right thing when faced with tricky situations. For
example, just because bribery is a common and acceptable practice in a country, that does not
make it the right thing to do, especially if it is illegal. When you are not sure which option is
the right one, investigate whether it is legal and ethical in that country.


Exam's Eye View
 Comprehend

  Honesty, truthfulness, and openness define integrity, which is the key to professionalism.
  While managing a project, you will perform the selected process for the project and will not
     cut corners--for example, to save money. A process is in place for the overall efficiency of the
     project, not as a formality.
  If an option sounds sneaky, manipulative, and as if it favors one stakeholder against another, it
     is not the option you want to choose.
  Disclose any conflict of interest to the relevant client and don't let this conflict influence your
     professional judgment.

 Look Out

  Do not do something that is illegal, unethical, or both in the country and culture of your
     workplace, even if it is legal and ethical back home.
  Do not do something that is illegal, unethical, or both, even if you are told that it is a com-
     mon and acceptable practice.
  When you encounter an unprofessional attitude or situation, deal with it quickly, honestly, and
     openly even when it is hard to do so and easy to ignore the problem.
  Beware of the options that offer you easier ways out or shortcuts. Those options are usually
     wrong.
  Showing respect to other cultures does not mean getting involved in something illegal.

 Memorize

  Follow the law of the land for your workplace.
  Show respect to other individuals and cultures.
  Honor the confidentiality of information that you learn during the course of getting certified,
     dealing with customers, and managing projects.
  Help advance the profession of project management by enhancing your individual professional
     competence and by contributing to the project management knowledge base.

4. You are managing a project in a country foreign to you and the project is in the plan-
    ning stage. The project sponsor asks you to inflate the cost estimate by 30 percent. He
    says, "We're not in Kansas anymore, buddy; if you want to get the license for a pistol
    here, you would have to apply for a machine gun." He insists that this is the only way
    he can get the required money because the management always reduces the estimate
    before allotting the money. Which of the following is the best step you could take?
      A. Report the project sponsor to PMI.
      B. Inflate the cost estimate as the sponsor said; after all, he is the sponsor.
      C. Prepare an accurate estimate along with a risk report that explains the risks
           involved if the adequate funds are not available.
      D. Prepare two cost estimates--one for the management and another one for actual
           implementation.
      E. Quit the project.

5. You are the project manager of a project that needs to procure a bunch of activities as
    a subproject due to the lack of skills in the organization. Your sister-in-law owns a

    shown an interest in this procurement. Which of the following steps would be the
    best to take?
      A. Allot this work to your sister-in-law. After all, her firm specializes in this area.
      B. Allot this work to your sister-in-law and make sure you don't let your relation-
          ship affect your professional judgment.
      C. Disclose your relationship with your sister-in-law to the stakeholders and allow
          multiple vendors to bid for the opportunity. Excuse yourself from the final deci-
          sion-making.
      D. Insist that this is part of networking and you can get the best deal from your
          sister-in-law.

6. Which two of the following are not expected by the PMP Code of Professional Con-
    duct? (Remember, choose two.)

Review Questions
Learning Objectives

   Understand why the correct answers are correct

   Understand why the incorrect answers are incorrect
Chapter 1
   1. Answer: D and E
      D and E are the correct answers because the defining characteristics of a project are
      that it must be temporary (with a start and finish date), and it must produce a unique
      (new) product.
      A and B are incorrect because it's possible to have a project that will involve only one
      person, and there could be a project without an individual called the project manager.
      The only two defining characteristics of a project are that it is temporary and unique.
      C is incorrect because an operation can have a budget too.

   2. Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because building a library is temporary--that is, it will have a
      start and a finish date, and it will be new library.
      A, C, and D are incorrect because running a donut shop, keeping a network up and
      running, and running a warehouse are all ongoing operations.

   3. Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because there is no process group in project management
      called implementing. The five process groups representing the five stages of the pro-
      ject lifecycle are initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling, and closing.
      A, B, D, and E are incorrect because the five process groups representing the five
      stages of the project lifecycle are initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/control-
      ling, and closing.

   4. Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because team management is part of the knowledge area
      called human resource management.
      A, B, C, and E are incorrect because all these are four of the nine project management
      knowledge areas.
       ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS                                     Appendix A           273


   5. Answer: A
      A is the correct and the best answer because the project plan is developed starting
      from the concept and going through progressive elaboration.
      B and C are incorrect because B includes project lifecycle and C is the lifecycle. Pro-
      gressive elaboration does not include the lifecycle of the project; its goal is to plan the
      project. Because the project planning can develop (or change) throughout the project
      lifecycle, progressive elaboration can continue through the project lifecycle, but it does
      not include the work of the lifecycle.
      D is incorrect because decomposing the project into smaller, more manageable work
      pieces is a technique used in creating the WBS.

   6. Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the matrix organization provides the greatest authority
      for the project manager.
      A and B are incorrect because the authority of the project manager is none to low in a
      functional organization and low to high in a matrix organization.
      D is incorrect because there is no organizational structure called leveled.

   7. Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the authority of the project manager is none to low in
      a functional organization.
      B and C are incorrect because the authority of the project manager is high to full in a
      projectized organization and low to high in a matrix organization.
      D is incorrect because there is no organizational structure called leveled.



Chapter 2
   1. Answer: A
      A is correct because the management of the performing organization issues the pro-
      ject charter.
      B is incorrect because issuing a project charter is the responsibility of the performing
      organization, and a stakeholder does not have to be even a member of the performing
      organization.
      C is incorrect because issuing a project charter is the responsibility of the performing
      organization, and a customer does not have to be even a member of the performing
      organization.
      D is incorrect because the charter authorizes the project manager and not vice versa.
274   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS


        2. Answer: B and D
           B and D are correct because the project charter and preliminary statement of work are
           two documents that are the output of the initiation process group.
           A is incorrect because the statement of work is an input to the initiation process
           group and not a result (output) of it.
           C is incorrect because the scope plan document does not belong to the initiation phase.

        3. Answer: B and C
           B and C are correct because the project charter names the project manger and pro-
           vides the project manager the authority to use organizational resources to run the pro-
           ject.
           A is incorrect because the sponsor is not authorized by the project charter; the oppo-
           site might be true.
           D is incorrect because it will be your responsibility to identify all the stakeholders.
           E is incorrect because the project team is not formed in the initiation phase.

        4. Answer: D
           D is correct because the initial defined risks item is part of the preliminary project
           statement, not a part of the project charter.
           A, B, C, and E are incorrect because all these items may be included in the project
           charter.

        5. Answer: F
           F is correct because the statement of work is an input into developing the preliminary
           project statement, not a part of it.
           A, B, C, D, and E are incorrect because all these items may be included in the prelim-
           inary project scope statement.

        6. Answer: A
           A is correct because the statement of work is an input to the project charter and the
           preliminary scope statement, and the project charter is an input to the preliminary
           scope statement.
           B is incorrect because the statement of work is an input to the project charter, so it
           must be available before the project charter.
           C is incorrect because both the statement of work and the project charter are input to
           the preliminary scope statement, so they must be developed before the scope state-
           ment can be.
           D is incorrect because the project charter is an input to the preliminary scope state-
           ment and not vice versa.

 7. Answer: B
     B is correct because a hard deadline imposed on a project is an example of a constraint.
     A is incorrect because an assumption is a factor that you believe to be true; it is not a
     condition such as a hard deadline.
     C is incorrect because a hard deadline tells very little about the actual schedule.
     D is incorrect because crashing is the process of assigning more resources to finish a
     project by a given deadline. Just because a deadline is given does not necessarily mean
     that you need crashing.

 8. Answer: B
     B is correct because assumptions represent uncertainty and hence risk. Assumptions
     must be validated and analyzed as part of the risk management at various stages of the
     project.
     A is incorrect because assumptions by definition represent uncertainty, and as a project
     manager, it is your responsibility to validate the assumptions at various stages of the
     project.
     C is incorrect because it is not the correct definition of assumption.
     D is incorrect because you can start the project with the assumptions. All you have to
     do is validate them at various stages of the project and analyze them as part of the risk
     management.

 9. Answer: E
     E is correct because enterprise environmental factors are an input to the project char-
     ter and the preliminary project statement, not a project selection method.
     A, B, C, and D are incorrect because expert judgment, scoring models, benefit cost
     ratio, and constrained optimization methods are all project selection methods.

10. Answer: A
    A is correct because adding parental guide notices is a business (legal) requirement.
    B is incorrect because adding these notices is not an opportunity to make revenues; it
    is a requirement that must be met to keep the Web site up without offending the cus-
    tomers or the legal system.
    C and D are incorrect because the project at hand does not solve any organizational
    problem and is not launched to meet any internal organizational need.
276   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS



   Chapter 3
        1. Answer: D
           D is the correct answer because the work packages don't have to appear in the order
           the work will be performed. This sequencing will be done later.
           A, B, and C are the incorrect answers because theses are the characteristics of the WBS.

        2. Answer: D
           D is correct because the project charter is created in the initiation stage and it is an
           input item to creating the preliminary project scope statement.
           A is incorrect because the project charter and the preliminary project scope statement
           are input items into creating the project scope statement.
           B is incorrect because the project scope statement is an input item into creating the
           WBS.
           C is incorrect because the project charter is an input item into creating the prelimi-
           nary project scope statement.

        3. Answer: A
           A is correct because the create WBS process is used to create the WBS.
           B is incorrect because the scope definition process is used to create the project scope
           statement.
           C is incorrect because there is no such process named creating project scope.
           D is incorrect because project initiation is a process group that includes two processes
           to develop the project charter and the preliminary project scope statement.

        4. Answer: B
           B is correct because the scope definition process is used to create the project scope
           statement.
           A is incorrect because the create WBS process is used to create the WBS.
           C is incorrect because there is no such process named creating project scope.
           D is incorrect because project initiation is a process group that includes two processes
           to develop the project charter and the preliminary project scope statement.

        5. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because the scope statement, the WBS document, and the
           WBS dictionary combined make the scope baseline against which all the change
           requests will be evaluated.
           A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are true statements about the project scope
           management plan.

 6. Answer: A
     A is correct because the components in the lowest level of the WBS hierarchy are
     called work packages.
     B is incorrect because a milestone might consist of more than one work package.
     C is incorrect because if a phase is represented in the WBS it will be represented at a
     much higher level.
     D is incorrect because a feature does not necessarily correspond to one work package.

 7. Answer: E
     E is correct because the four constraints common across all the projects are resources,
     scope, time, and quality.
     A, B, C, and D are incorrect because the four constraints common across all the pro-
     jects are resources, scope, time, and quality. Cost (resources), scope, and schedule
     (time) are the constraints collectively called a triple constraint because if one of them
     changes, at least one of the other two must change.

 8. Answer: D
     D is correct because the detailed scope statement, the WBS document, and the WBS
     dictionary combined make the scope baseline for the project.
     A is incorrect because the preliminary scope statement does not need to be included in
     the baseline, whereas you must include the WBS document and the WBS dictionary.
     B is incorrect because you must include the WBS document and the WBS dictionary
     in the scope baseline.
     C is incorrect because you must include the scope statement and the WBS dictionary
     in the scope baseline.
     E is incorrect because you must include the scope statement in the scope baseline.

 9. Answer: D
     D is correct because you, the project manager, create the WBS with help from the
     project team.
     A is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with help from the team.
     B is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with help from the team;
     however, the project sponsor can help as part of the team.
     C and E are incorrect because neither the customer nor the upper management of the
     performing organization creates the WBS.

10. Answer: B
    B is correct because the WBS is not part of the project statement; it is an output of
    the create WBS process, to which the scope statement is an input item.
    A, C, D, and E are incorrect because all these items are parts of the scope statement.
278   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS



   Chapter 4
        1. Answer: B
           B is the correct answer because a risk can have a negative or a positive effect on
           a project.
           A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements about project risks.

        2. Answer: A
           A is correct because the risk register is the output of the risk identification process,
           but it is not used as an input because it does not exist before this process.
           B, C, and D are incorrect because the risk register is an input item to qualitative risk
           analysis, quantitative risk analysis, and risk response planning, whereas the updated
           risk register is an output from each of these processes.

        3. Answer: D
           D is the correct answer because you cannot identify risks in your specific project based
           on the information collected from the Web.
           A, B, and C are incorrect answers because brainstorming, Delphi technique, and
           SWOT analysis are valid information-gathering techniques used for identifying risks.

        4. Answer: A
           A is the correct answer because depending upon the experience of the team, a risk can
           be moved directly after the identification process to the quantitative process without
           performing the qualitative analysis.
           B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are true statements.

        5. Answer: B
           B is correct because building redundancy into a system is an example of mitigating the
           risk.
           A is incorrect because the risk can still happen because you have not changed the
           plan, such as moving the server center to some other city.
           C is incorrect because accepting a risk means no action or conditional action.
           D is incorrect because you have not transferred the risk to a third party.

        6. Answer: D
           D is correct because you have transferred the risk to a third party.
           A is incorrect because the risk can still happen because you have not changed the
           plan, such as eliminating the need for that part of the system.
           B is incorrect because mitigating the risk does not involve transferring the risk to a
           third party.
           C is incorrect because accepting a risk means no action or conditional action.

 7. Answer: C
     C is correct because the numerical analysis of a risk is called quantitative analysis.
     A is incorrect because assigning numbers does not necessarily mean you are perform-
     ing a Monte Carlo simulation, although it is one of the tools to perform quantitative
     analysis.
     B is incorrect because qualitative analysis does not involve numerical analysis, such as
     EMV calculations.
     D is incorrect because risk response planning will be based on the results of risk
     analysis.

 8. Answer: D
     D is correct because the probability of the risk is 50% and the probability of the
     positive impact is 40%, so the total probability for the positive impact to happen is
     0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
            EMV = Probability * Value of the outcome = 0.2 * $200, 000 = $40,000
     A, B, and C are incorrect because they show wrong values for EMV.

 9. Answer: A
     A is correct because the probability of the risk is 50%, and the probability of the
     positive impact is 40%, so the total probability for the positive impact to happen is
     0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
            EMV = Probability * Value of the outcome = 0.2 * $200, 000 = $40,000
            Similarly, EMV for threat = 0.3 * $50,000 = -$15,000
            Therefore, EMV for the risk = $40,000 - $15,000 = $25,000
     B, C, and D are incorrect because they show wrong values for EMV.

10. Answer: E
    E is correct because secondary risks are those risks that arise as a result of risk
    responses.
    A is incorrect because a residual risk is a risk that remains after a response has been
    performed.
    B is incorrect because depending upon the nature of the secondary risk, it may have
    any priority.
    C and D are incorrect because the risk response will depend upon the analysis results
    of the risk.

11. Answer: E
    E is the correct answer because there is no such risk response named risk rejection.
    A, B, C, and D are all incorrect answers because these are valid risk responses.

        12. Answer: A
            A is correct because SWOT is a risk identification technique that identifies the risks
            by examining the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of a
            given project.
            B is incorrect because this is a wrong statement about SWOT.
            C and D are incorrect because SWOT is a technique used in risk identification, not in
            risk response planning, nor in quantitative risk analysis.

        13. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because you need to perform quantitative risk analysis to cre-
            ate a list of risks prioritized based on the total effect of each risk on the overall project
            objectives.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because these are the possible output items from the quali-
            tative risk analysis.

        14. Answer: E
            E is the correct answer because a risk-related contractual agreement can be an output
            of the risk response planning, not the quantitative risk analysis.
            A, B, C, and D are incorrect because all these are the possible output items from the
            quantitative risk analysis.

        15. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because benchmarking is a quality planning technique that
            compares practices, products, or services of a project with those of some reference pro-
            jects for the purpose of learning, improving, and creating the basis for measuring per-
            formance.
             A is incorrect because you can always brainstorm, but it does not have to compare the
             results of similar activities.
             C is incorrect because although it is a quality planning technique, it involves striking a
             balance between cost and benefit (which are not similar).
             D and E are incorrect because quality metrics and quality checklists are not quality
             planning techniques; these are the output items of the quality planning process.

Chapter 5
   1. Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the precedence diagramming method is the most
      commonly used network diagramming method that can be used in the activity
      sequencing process to represent any of the four kinds of dependencies.
      A and B are incorrect because CPM and CCM are the network diagram analysis
      methods that are used in the schedule development process.
      D is incorrect because the arrow diagramming method is not the popular method, and
      it can only be used to represent one of the four kinds of dependencies: the finish-to-
      start dependency.

   2. Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because crashing is used to compress the schedule by adding
      more resources to the project.
      A and D are incorrect because the network diagramming method and the sequencing
      method do not need crashing.
      C is incorrect because crashing does not reduce cost. It may well increase cost when
      you commit additional resources.

   3. Answer: E
      E is the correct answer because the critical path is the longest sequence in the network
      diagram, and therefore it controls the finish date for a given start date; also, each
      activity on the critical path has a zero float time.
      Because both A and B are true, and you are allowed to choose only one, you choose E.
      C is incorrect because the critical path controls the finish date for a given start date.
      D is incorrect because the critical path is the longest sequence, not the shortest.

   4. Answer: B
      B is the correct answer because an activity has external dependency when it relies on
      factors outside the project.
      A is incorrect because activity Y has a mandatory dependency on activity X when Y
      inherently depends on X.
      C is incorrect because there is no such dependency called internal.
      D is incorrect because we have an external dependency here.
      E is incorrect because the finish-to-start relationship is not relevant to this dependency.
282   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS


        5. Answer: B and E
           B and E are correct because finish-to-start dependency means that the successor (B)
           activity cannot start until the predecessor (A) activity is finished.
           A is incorrect because the start-to-finish relationship means that the successor activity
           cannot finish until the predecessor activity is started.
           C is incorrect because we do not have enough information to say that this dependency
           is mandatory.
           D is incorrect because just because there is a dependency between two activities, that
           does not mean they are on the critical path.

        6. Answer: A
           A is the correct answer because each activity on the critical path has a zero float time,
           and therefore if an activity is delayed it will delay the entire project.
           B, C, and D are incorrect because these are incorrect statements about the activities
           on the critical path.

        7. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because the analogous estimating technique estimates the
           duration of an activity based on the duration of a similar activity in a previous project.
           A is incorrect because parametric estimating uses parameters such as the productivity
           rate of the resource assigned to the activity.
           B is incorrect because the individual in this example used the analogous method and
           not the expert judgment method, even though he happened to be an expert.
           D is incorrect because the Delphi technique is used for risk identification, not for
           activity duration estimating, and also there are multiple experts involved in the Delphi
           technique.

        8. Answer: C
           C is correct because the team member is offering a valid reason for the change, and it
           does not affect the finish date of the project. However you must change the schedule
           to reflect the new duration estimate.
           A and F are incorrect because you do not need to consult with the functional manager
           or the project sponsor in making this decision because the team member is offering a
           valid reason for the change, and it does not affect the finish date of the project.
           B is incorrect because the schedule should reflect the current reality. Because you
           accepted the schedule change, the schedule must reflect it.
           D is incorrect because this change does not qualify to be processed through the inte-
           grated change control process.
           E is incorrect because the proposed change does not mean that the team member
           does not have the skills to perform the activity.

 9. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because float time is the positive difference between the
     allowed late start date and the early start date of a schedule activity, without changing
     the schedule finish date.
     B, C, and D are incorrect because these are not the valid terms used to describe delay-
     ing an activity without changing the schedule finish date.

10. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because by doing some activities in parallel (fast tracking) you
    might be able to compress the schedule without adding cost.
    A is incorrect because crashing usually results in increased cost because it involves
    adding extra resources.
    C is incorrect because the project sponsor is sponsoring (paying for) the project. So,
    asking for a new sponsor does not make sense; it can only trigger the sponsor to ask
    for a new project manager.
    D is incorrect because you do not want to bypass the sponsor on budgetary matters
    because the budget will need the sponsor's approval.
    E is incorrect because your role is of a project manager, and that's what you should do.
    By performing the activities yourself, you might be stepping on other people's toes--
    and, how many projects can you finish in time by applying this technique?

11. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because it has the longest sequence: 8 + 6 + 8 = 22.
     A is incorrect because this path is only 20 units long.
     B is incorrect because there is no such path as Start-I-G-E-Finish in this network
     diagram.
     D is incorrect because this path is only 21 units long, which is less than 22.
     E is incorrect because there is no such path as Start-I-G-H-E-Finish in this network
     diagram.

12. Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because the float time for G is zero because it is on the critical
     path.
     A, B, and C are incorrect because G is on the critical path and must have a float time
     of zero.

13. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because if you consider all the paths in the network diagram,
     the path Start-F-G-H-Finish adds up to 22, which is longer than any other path in
     the diagram.
     A, B, D, and E are incorrect because they do not add up to the correct total for the path.
284   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS


        14. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because in the three-point method the duration estimate is
            calculated as the average of the three values: (9 + 18 + 12) / 3 = 13.
            B is incorrect because the average should be taken of the three points, not just
            between the smallest and the largest number.
            C, D, and E are incorrect because the duration estimate is the average of the three points.

        15. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the activity duration is calculated after an activity has
            been defined.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because the WBS, project scope statement, and WBS dic-
            tionary are valid input items to the activity definition process.

        16. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because a chart that displays the resource requirements for
            each activity is an example of a resource assignment matrix (RAM).
            A is incorrect because a project organization chart represents the relationships
            between the different roles in the project, and that is not what the management
            wants.
            B is incorrect because the WBS contains the work packages, not the activities and the
            resource requirements.
            C is incorrect because the management wants the resource requirements for each
            activity, not just a list of roles and responsibilities.

        17. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the project schedule is the output of the schedule
            development process.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are the output of the human resource
            planning process.

        18. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the project manager (along with the project manage-
            ment team) is responsible for the staff management plan, and it is created as an out-
            put of the human resource planning process.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because these are the false statements about the staff man-
            agement plan.

Chapter 6
   1. Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because corrective actions are recommended by the QA
      process.
      A, B, and C are incorrect answers because deliverables and work performance infor-
      mation (status) are generated, and defect repairs are implemented by the direct and
      manage project execution process.

   2. Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because corrective actions are an output item of the QA
      process.
      A, B, and C are incorrect answers because quality metrics are generated by quality
      planning, work performance information (status) is generated, and defect repairs are
      implemented by the direct and manage project execution process, and they all become
      input to the QA process.

   3. Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because cost overrun is paid by the buyer, and the fee increases
      with the increase in cost as well.
      A is incorrect because the firm fixed price presents risk to both buyer and seller
      because the fixed price might turn out to be above or below the actual cost.
      B and D are incorrect because the fee in these cases does not rise with the rise of the
      actual cost.
      E is incorrect because in a time and material contract, there could be a cost overrun to
      be paid by the buyer, but unlike a contract, in the category of cost plus percentage of
      cost there is no increasing fee attached to the increasing cost.

   4. Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because a firm fixed price presents a risk to the seller if the
      fixed price turns out to be lower than the actual cost.
      B, C, D, and E are incorrect because only the firm fixed price can present risk to the
      seller.

   5. Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the buy or make analysis is a technique used in the
      procurement planning process called plan purchases and acquisitions.
      A, B, and D are incorrect because you must know if you are going to buy or make
      before you start implementing the procurement.
286   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS


        6. Answer: A
           A is the correct answer because you can fairly estimate the cost for one program, and
           you do not know the number of programs required.
           B and C are incorrect because the reimbursable cost does not make sense in this case,
           and you don't have to add a fee to the cost.
           D is incorrect because you cannot correctly estimate the total price because you do not
           know how many programs are required.

        7. Answer: D
           D is the correct answer because the procurement documents should be rigorous
           enough to ensure consistent responses from different sellers that could be fairly com-
           pared with one another, and flexible enough to allow the sellers to offer suggestions
           on better ways to satisfy the requirements.
           A is incorrect because it does not allow the sellers to be creative in offering solutions.
           B is incorrect because the documents must be rigid enough that each seller under-
           stands the requirements.
           C is incorrect because the requirements are set by the buyer and not by the seller.

        8. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because the amount of work, and hence the cost, cannot be
           determined at this point.
           A is incorrect because the amount of work, and hence the cost, cannot be determined
           at this point.
           B is incorrect because a time and material contract is used when the cost of an item
           can be fairly estimated but the number of needed items is unknown. This is not the
           case here.
           D is incorrect because there is no such contract type as cost plus time.

        9. Answer: E
           E is the correct answer because collaboration offers a win/win resolution.
           A is incorrect because avoidance ignores the problem rather than solving it.
           B is incorrect because in compromising both parties give up something and might
           look at the resolution as a lose/lose proposition.
           C is incorrect because accommodation offers a win/lose resolution; one party gives up
           something to accommodate the interests of the other party.
           D is incorrect because in competition one party attempts to get its way at the expense
           of the other party, and it could cause the conflict to escalate. Even using this tech-
           nique from a power position (forcing) is not a good idea, when you have a choice.

10. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because quality planning is the process to plan for quality,
    which is the degree to which the project requirements are met.
    A is incorrect because quality control is the process to monitor the specific project
    results to ensure they meet the planned quality standards.
    C is incorrect because quality assurance is the process of applying (not planning) the
    planned quality activities to ensure (and verify) that the requirements are met.
    D is incorrect because this answer is not relevant to the given scenario.

11. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the quality audit is a technique for performing quality
    assurance.
    B and C are incorrect because the quality audit is a technique for performing quality
    assurance, whereas quality planning is about determining which quality standards are
    relevant to the project, and how to satisfy them. Quality assurance is about applying
    the planned quality activities.
    D is incorrect because there is no such quality management process as quality
    inspection.

12. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because you are forcing your way on the other party.
    A and B are incorrect because you are neither ignoring the problem nor compromising.
    C is incorrect because you are not accommodating the other side.

13. Answer: E
    E is the correct answer because change in budget has very little to do directly with the
    team development.
    A and B are incorrect answers because the project kickoff meeting is an indirect
    method to start team development, and an effective resolution of a conflict does con-
    tribute to team building.
    C and D are also incorrect answers because during the times when the team is in a
    low-morale mode, you should be able to lift the team morale and thereby contribute
    to team development. Also, during the organizational changes, some team members
    might start wondering what it means to them, which might disrupt the project work.
    So, it is your responsibility to help the team keep their eyes on the ball, and this way
    you contribute to the team development.

           fishbone diagram, is used to explore all the possible causes of a problem.
           C is incorrect because a Pareto diagram is used to identify and rank the errors based

           variables, such as cause and effect, or two causes.

        4. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because a Pareto diagram can be used to rank the problems
           based on the frequency of defects caused by them. Then, you will direct the team
           effort to fix those problems that caused most of the defects.

        10. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the formula for earned value is:
                  EV = BAC x (work completed % total work required)
            which means
                  EV = $600,000 x (5 miles % 15 miles) = $200,000
            A is incorrect because $160,000 is the actual cost (AC) and not the earned value
            (EV).
            C is incorrect because earned value is proportional to the fraction of work performed
            and not the fraction of time passed.
            D is incorrect because $600,000 is the budget at completion (BAC), not EV.

        11. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the formula for planned value is:
                   PV = BAC x (time passed % total schedule time)
            which means
                   PV = $600,000 x (3 weeks % 12 weeks) = $150, 000
            A is incorrect because $160,000 is the actual cost (AC) and not the planned value
            (EV).
            B is incorrect because planned value is proportional to the fraction of time passed, not
            the fraction of work performed.
            D is incorrect because $600,000 is the budget at completion (BAC), not PV.

        12. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the formula for cost variance is:
                   CV = EV - AC
            which means
                   CV = $200,000 - $160,000 = $40, 000
            B is incorrect because CV is equal to EV - AC, not EV - PV.
            C is incorrect because it calculates the total cost for 12 weeks based on AC for three
            weeks and then subtracts it from BAC, which is the wrong method to calculate CV.
            D is incorrect because it calculates the total cost for 15 miles based on AC for five
            miles and then subtracts it from BAC, which is the wrong method to calculate CV.
            E is incorrect because CV is not equal to PV - AC.

   13. Answer: B
       B is the correct answer because the formula for schedule variance is:
              SV = EV - PV
       which means
              SV = $200,000 - $150,000 = $50, 000
       A is incorrect because SV is equal to EV - PV, not EV - AC.
       C and D are incorrect because SV is measured in units of cost, not in units of time.

   14. Answer: B
       B is the correct answer because a CPI value greater than one means the cost perfor-
       mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than one
       means the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.
       A, C, and D are incorrect because a CPI value greater than one means the cost perfor-
       mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than one
       means the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.



Chapter 8
    1. Answer: E
       E is the correct answer because if the project is behind the planned schedule, it does
       not mean it should be closed. You can bring it back on schedule or you can change
       the plan accordingly.
       A, B, C, and D are incorrect because all these scenarios will cause the project to close,
       and when a project is closed it must be closed by using the processes in the closing
       process group.

    2. Answer: A
       A is the correct answer because the future projects can benefit the most from the review
       if all the stages of the project are covered with both positive and negative aspects.
       B and D are incorrect because all the stages and aspects of the project should be reviewed.
       C is incorrect because both positive and negative aspects should be covered with equal
       emphasis.

    3. Answer: D
       D is the correct answer because if the project is to be successful, it must have been
       executed and controlled successfully before the closure begins.
       A, B, and C are incorrect because if a project has not made it to the closing stage by
       the time closing begins, the project is being terminated without completion.
       E is incorrect because there is no such project stage called completing.
292   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS


        4. Answer: D
           D is the correct answer because no project, small or large, should skip the closing
           stage.
           A, B, C, and E are incorrect because no project should skip the closing stage. Each
           project must go through a proper closure.

        5. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because it is the project sponsor who signs the final closure
           documents and can send the project to closure at any stage of the project.
           A is incorrect because the project manager is responsible for managing all the activi-
           ties needed to close the project, but the closure must be authorized by the sponsor.
           B and E are incorrect because neither the customer nor the functional manager can
           authorize the project closure.
           D is obviously incorrect because it is almost equivalent to saying that any person on
           the street can close your project, because the definition of the stakeholder is so wide.

        6. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because closing contracts is part of the contract closure, not
           the administrative closure.
           A, B, and D are incorrect because all these activities are part of the administrative clo-
           sure.

        7. Answer: A
           A is the correct answer because the administrative closure procedure is the output of
           the close project process, not the input.
           B, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are valid input to the close project
           process.

        8. Answer: C
           C is the correct answer because the closed contracts are the output of the contract clo-
           sure process.
           A and B are incorrect because both administrative and contract closure procedures are
           the output of the close project process.
           D is incorrect because project closure documentation should be archived as an output
           of the close project process.

        9. Answer: D
           D is the correct answer because the work portion of the project, also called the admin-
           istrative closure, is closed by using the close project process.
           A and C are incorrect because these are not the valid process names.
           B is incorrect because the contract closure process is used to close the contracts.

   10. Answer: A and B
       A and B are the correct answers because you can review the project work as well as the
       procurement work and procedure and learn from both.
       C and D are incorrect because these are no closing processes with these names.



Chapter 9
    1. Answer: D
       D is the correct answer because the PMP code of professional conduct states that
       upon a reasonable and clear factual basis, it is your responsibility to report possible
       violations of the PMP Code of Professional Conduct by individuals in the field of
       project management.
       A and B are incorrect because you can do it if you feel like it, but this is not the best
       answer.
       C is incorrect because you don't know whether a law was violated, and according to
       the code of conduct statement, D is the best answer.

    2. Answer: A
       A is the correct answer because if in a foreign land you are being asked to do some-
       thing that is unethical and illegal, you are supposed to investigate whether it is illegal
       and unethical there as well.
       B and D are incorrect because you don't know yet whether the sponsor is asking you
       to do something illegal.
       C is incorrect because you think it is unethical and illegal, so you must investigate it.

    3. Answer: B
       B is the correct answer because you should share your findings that this is an illegal
       activity with the project sponsor.
       A is incorrect because it clearly disobeys the law of the land.
       C, D, and E are incorrect because B is the best answer.

    4. Answer: C
       C is the correct answer because honesty, openness, and truthfulness are part and parcel
       of professional behavior, and this is true inside and outside of Kansas. Regardless of
       where you are, the professional code of conduct is the same.
       A is incorrect because you do not have enough information to take this step.
       B and D are both incorrect because you are not being truthful, honest, and open.
       E is incorrect because it's not necessary to quit the project at this stage.
294   Appendix A ANSWERS TO CHAPTER REVIEW QUESTIONS


         5. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because this is a case of possible conflict of interest, and option
            C is the right thing to do.
            A and B are incorrect because you are not disclosing a possible conflict of interest.
            D is incorrect because this is a possible conflict of interest or can be looked upon as
            such by others, rather than as mere networking.

         6. Answer: C and F
            C and F are the correct answers because these are not part of the PMP Code of Pro-
            fessional Conduct.
            A, B, D, and E are all incorrect because these activities are included in the PMP
            Code of Professional Conduct.

         7. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because you want to make sure that Best Deals is making the
            estimate based on the same information about the work that the other vendors are.
            A and C are incorrect because you are violating the confidentiality.
            D is incorrect because it is an unnecessary activity.

         8. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because as a project manager it is your responsibility to facili-
            tate interaction among the stakeholders and resolve conflicts.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because it is your responsibility to resolve this conflict.

         9. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because as a project manager it is your responsibility to keep
            the stakeholders informed of the project status.
            A is incorrect because you are not performing your responsibility to provide true pro-
            ject status to the stakeholders.
            C is incorrect because you don't have enough information to take this action.
            D is incorrect because it is your responsibility to investigate the situation and propose
            a solution.

        10. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because it is not your job to investigate the legality of the
            company procedures.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are parts of the professional responsibility
            of a project manager.

Answers and Explanations
   1. Answer: E
      E is the correct answer because cost variance is not a project selection method. In fact,
      you will not be able to determine the cost variance until the project starts executing.
      A, B, C, and D are incorrect because these are valid project selection methods.

   2. Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because internal and external investors can be the stakeholders
      in your project, but they are not the key stakeholders.
      B, C, D, and E are incorrect because these are the key stakeholders. The CEO of your
      company is an influencer.

   3. Answer: C
      C is the correct answer because the project charter, which is an output of a process of
      the initiating process group, must be approved before the project can start.
      A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not the outputs of the processes in the ini-
      tiating process group.

   4. Answer: A
      A is the correct answer because the project charter approval officially starts the project.
      B is incorrect because the project scope statement determines the scope of the project,
      whereas the project charter must be approved before you start the project.
      C is incorrect because there is no such document as the project initiation plan docu-
      ment.
      D is incorrect because the project management plan is produced in the planning stage
      of the project, and the project does not move to the planning stage until the project
      charter is approved.

   5. Answer: D
      D is the correct answer because the perform quality control process is used to recom-
      mend corrective or preventive actions to meet quality standards.
      A is incorrect because testing is not a project management process.
      B is incorrect because quality planning is used to identify the quality standards rele-
      vant to the project and to determine how to satisfy them.
      C is incorrect because the risk response planning process is used during the planning
      stage for the identified risks, not during the control stage.
      E is incorrect because executing is not a process; it is a process group.

         6. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the two defining characteristics of a project are that it
            has a beginning and an end, and it creates a unique product, service, or results.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because they exclude two defining characteristics of a pro-
            ject: It has a beginning and an end, and it creates a unique product, service, or results.

         7. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because a program is a set of related projects that are managed
            in a coordinated way to obtain the optimal results.
            A is incorrect because a large budget does not make a project a program.
            B is incorrect because a set of processes is called a process group.
            C is incorrect because the projects in a program should be related to each other.

         8. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the plan purchases and acquisitions and plan contract-
            ing processes are used to plan the procurement.
            B and C are incorrect because neither of these is a correct name for any of the project
            management processes.
            D is incorrect because the human resource planning process is used to plan the human
            resources in the performing organization; it is not part of procurement planning.

         9. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the next step after planning is to request seller
            responses.
            B and C are incorrect because neither of these is a correct name for any of the project
            management processes.
            D is incorrect because the select sellers process is performed after the request seller
            responses process.

        10. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the project manager has the highest level of authority
            in a projectized organization.
            A is incorrect because the project manager has the lowest level of authority in a func-
            tional organization.
            B is incorrect because project manager's authority in a strong matrix organization is
            not higher than that in a projectized organization.
            C is incorrect because project manager's authority in a weak matrix organization is
            lower than that in a projectized organization.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix B          337


11. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the project manager has the lowest level of authority
    in a functional organization.
    B is incorrect because project manager's authority in a strong matrix organization is
    higher than that in a functional organization.
    C is incorrect because project manager's authority in a weak matrix organization is
    higher than that in a functional organization.
    D is incorrect because the project manager has the highest level of authority in a pro-
    jectized organization.

12. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because performance evaluations belong to the
    monitoring/controlling process group.
    A and B are incorrect because performance evaluations belong to the monitoring/con-
    trolling process group.
    D is incorrect because there is no project management process group named evaluating.

13. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the
    project stakeholders' expectations.
    A is incorrect because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the project
    stakeholders' expectations.
    B and C are incorrect because the differences about objectives (and conflicts among
    the team members) must be resolved. Different expectations for the project mean that
    the stakeholders are not on the same page about the project scope, and that can be
    damaging for the project.

14. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because the five process groups are initiating, planning, execut-
    ing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Note that monitoring and controlling is
    the name of one process group; it is also called monitoring or controlling.
    A is incorrect because monitoring and controlling is one process group.
    C and D are incorrect because scoping and testing are not valid names for the project
    management process groups.
338   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        15. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the project charter must make the business' case to
            justify the project.
            B is incorrect because the SOW is an input to the develop project charter process.
            C is incorrect because the project scope statement is not part of the project charter.
            D is incorrect because the scope of the project management plan is much wider than
            the project charter.

        16. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because process groups usually involve overlapping activities.
            For example, you monitor and control the project at the same time as you are execut-
            ing it.
            A and D are incorrect because process groups are seldom either discrete or one-time
            events.
            C is incorrect because the level of involvement for a given process group might be dif-
            ferent for different phases of a project; it depends upon the needs.
            E is incorrect because it's silly--the processes that will be executed from a process
            group are determined by the needs of the project.

        17. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because reviewing the initiating processes at the beginning of
            each phase helps keep the project focused on the business need for which the project
            was started.
            A is incorrect because it's the wrong reason for reviewing the initiating processes.
            B is incorrect because one of the purposes of reviewing the initiating processes is to
            determine whether the project should continue. If the business needs have changed,
            either the project should be cancelled or its scope should be changed.
            D is incorrect because reviewing the initiating process is not a waste of time; it is a
            very important task.

        18. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because in functional organizations, the functional managers
            are the bosses who assign the work to the employees.
            B is incorrect because employees do not report to the project managers in a functional
            organization.
            C and D are incorrect because the project teams and project management teams do
            not make the work assignment decisions.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix B          339


19. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the initiating group is used to authorize a project or a
    phase of a project.
    B is incorrect because there is no project management process group named phase ini-
    tiating.
    C and D are incorrect because the planning and executing process groups are not used
    to authorize a project.

20. Answer: B and F
    B and F are the correct answers because the five project management process groups
    are initiating, planning, monitoring and controlling, executing, and closing.
    A, C, D, E, and G are incorrect because these are the valid names for the project
    management process groups.

21. Answer: B and E
    B and E are the correct answers because team management and outsource manage-
    ment are not valid names for the project management knowledge areas recognized by
    PMI.
    A, C, D, F, and G are incorrect because these are valid names for the project manage-
    ment knowledge areas.

22. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because a Pareto diagram is used to prioritize defects by dis-
    playing the frequencies of their occurrences. It is a tool used in the perform quality
    control process.
    A is incorrect because a control chart is used to determine whether an output variable
    is within the control limits. It is a tool used in the perform quality control process.
    C is incorrect because the decision tree analysis is a technique used in the quantitative
    risk analysis to choose between alternative capital strategies, such as to build or
    upgrade.
    D is incorrect because variance analysis is a technique used to measure the project
    performance by comparing the actual performance with the planned performance.
    The performance metrics are generally the schedule, scope, and cost. So, variance
    analysis can be used in cost control, scope control, and schedule control.
340   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        23. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the quality planning process is part of the planning
            process group.
            B and C are incorrect because identifying the quality standards and determining how
            to satisfy them is part of planning, not executing or controlling.
            D is incorrect because there is no process group named quality planning process
            group.

        24. Answer: D and E
            D and E are the correct answers because there is no process named time estimating,
            and the human resource planning process belongs to the human resource manage-
            ment.
            A, B, C, and F are incorrect because all these processes belong to time management.

        25. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because variance analysis is a technique used to measure the
            project performance by comparing the actual performance to the planned performance
            in terms of scope, cost, and schedule. So, variance analysis can be used in cost control,
            scope control, and schedule control.
            A is incorrect because a control chart is used to determine whether an output variable
            is within the control limits. It is a tool used in the perform quality control process.
            B is incorrect answer because a Pareto diagram is used to prioritize defects by display-
            ing the frequencies of their occurrences. It is a tool used in the perform quality control
            process.
            C is incorrect because decision tree analysis is a technique used in the quantitative risk
            analysis to choose between alternative capital strategies, such as to build or upgrade.

        26. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the purpose of the schedule control process is to man-
            age (monitor and control) the schedule changes and make sure the changes go
            through an approval system before implementation.
            A is incorrect because schedule control does not mean no change.
            C is incorrect because scope creep is an issue that belongs to scope control.
            D is incorrect because the schedule control process is to control all schedule-related
            changes, not just those related to the activities on the critical path.

        27. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the scope is determined by the project scope state-
            ment, not by the project charter.
            B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are correct statements about project
            charter.
                                                     FINAL EXAM               Appendix B           341


28. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because the preliminary scope statement is an output of the
    process called develop preliminary project scope statement.
    A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are all valid items to be included in
    the preliminary project scope statement.

29. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because the project scope statement, also called the detailed
    project scope statement, is the major output of the scope definition process.
    A and C are incorrect because the project charter and the preliminary project state-
    ment are input items to the project definition process.
    D is incorrect because you need to perform many other processes after the project
    definition process before you can develop the project schedule.

30. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because decision tree analysis is a technique used in the quan-
    titative risk analysis to choose between alternative capital strategies, such as to build or
    upgrade.
    A is incorrect because a control chart is used to determine whether an output variable
    is within the control limits. It is a tool used in the perform quality control process.
    B is incorrect because a Pareto diagram is used to prioritize defects by displaying the
    frequencies of their occurrences. It is a tool used in the perform quality control
    process.
    D is incorrect answer because variance analysis is a technique used to measure the
    project performance by comparing the actual performance to the planned performance
    in terms of scope, cost, and schedule. So, variance analysis can be used in cost control,
    scope control, and schedule control.

31. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because a constraint is a state of being restricted to a given
    course of action (or inaction). It limits the team's options. Hard deadlines and prede-
    fined budgets are examples of constraints.
    B and C are incorrect because quality standards and activities on the critical path are
    not constraints.
    D is incorrect because the possibility of a strike is a risk, not a constraint.

32. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because the project scope management plan is an output of the
    scope planning process, which does not take the WBS as an input.
    A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these are true statements about the pro-
    ject scope management plan.
342   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        33. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the output of the scope planning process is the project
            scope management plan.
            B is incorrect because the project scope management plan is only a part of the project
            management plan.
            C and D are incorrect because the project scope management plan, the output of the
            scope planning, only describes how to define the scope and create the WBS.

        34. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the detailed project scope statement is an output of
            the scope definition process.
            A, B, and C are incorrect because all these are the input items to the scope definition
            process.

        35. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the project scope statement is used to create the WBS,
            but it does not already contain the WBS.
            A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these items are included in the project
            scope statement.

        36. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because when you, the project manager, anticipate or see a
            potential problem, you should deal with it head on.
            A is incorrect because this option ignores the problem. You should not sit and let the
            problem happen before you act.
            B and C are incorrect answers because these options do not deal with the problem
            directly.
            E is incorrect because you are not confronting the problem, you are simply accepting it.

        37. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the SOW is written by the buyer to describe the prod-
            uct to be procured.
            A is incorrect because the SOW is not a contract.
            C is incorrect because the SOW is only written for the activities or the products to be
            procured.
            D is incorrect because the SOW is written by the buyer to describe the product to be
            procured.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix B          343


38. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because expert judgment, templates, forms, and standards are
    the tools used in the scope planning process.
    B and C are incorrect because product analysis and stakeholder analysis are the tools
    for the scope definition process used to develop the project scope statement.
    D is incorrect because the project charter is an input to the scope planning process,
    not a tool.

39. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because the project charter is an input to the scope definition
    process, not a tool.
    A, B, and C are incorrect answers because expert judgment, product analysis, and
    stakeholder analysis are all tools for the project definition process.

40. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-
    oriented hierarchical decomposition of the project work to be performed by the pro-
    ject team.
    B is incorrect because the hierarchy of resources is called the resource breakdown struc-
    ture (RBS).
    C is incorrect because the hierarchy of risks is called the risk breakdown structure
    (RBS).
    D is incorrect because the organization structure is called the organizational break-
    down structure (OBS).

41. Answer: A and B
    A and B are the correct answers because the WBS is a direct input to the activity defi-
    nition process and the cost estimating process.
    C is incorrect because the scope definition process is used to develop the project scope
    statement, which is an input to the create WBS process.
    D and E are incorrect because the WBS is not a direct input to these processes.

42. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because the WBS is created by decomposing the project deliv-
    erables into smaller components.
    A and B are incorrect because a Pareto chart is used in the perform quality control
    process, and analogous estimating is a technique used in cost estimating.
    D is incorrect because the bottom-up estimating technique is used in the activity
    resource estimating process.
344   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        43. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the purpose of the variance analysis is to measure the
            deviation of the actual project performance from the planned baseline and determine
            the cause of this variance.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the variance analysis.

        44. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because updates to cost estimates are an output of the cost
            control process.
            A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are all valid output items for the
            scope control process.

        45. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the create WBS process is part of the planning process
            group.
            A and C are incorrect because the WBS is created by using the create WBS process,
            which is part of the planning process group.
            D is incorrect because there is no process group named scoping.

        46. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the critical path results from sequencing of activities
            and their durations.
            A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these affect the activity duration.

        47. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because crashing is the schedule compression technique that
            involves analyzing a number of alternatives and choosing the one that lets you get the
            maximum schedule compression for the minimum cost increase.
            A is incorrect because fast tracking is the schedule compression technique that
            involves obtaining the schedule compression by executing activities (or phases) in par-
            allel that would normally be executed in sequence.
            B is incorrect because PDM (precedence diagramming method) is a technique to
            develop the network diagram; it's not a schedule compression technique.
            D is incorrect because there is no schedule compression technique named critical path
            elimination.

        48. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the RBS is not an input to the project definition
            process.
            A, B, and C are incorrect because the project scope statement, WBS, and project
            management plan are all input items to the activity definition process.

    A is the correct answer because fast tracking is the schedule compression technique
    that involves obtaining the schedule compression by executing activities (or phases) in
    parallel that would normally be executed in sequence.
    B is incorrect because PDM (precedence diagramming method) is a technique to
    develop the network diagram; it's not a schedule compression technique.
    C is incorrect because crashing is the schedule compression technique that involves
    analyzing a number of alternatives and choosing the one that lets you get the maxi-
    mum schedule compression for the minimum cost increase.
    D is incorrect because there is no schedule compression technique named critical path
    elimination.

50. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because parametric estimating is a technique used in the activ-
    ity duration estimating process.
    A, C, and D are incorrect because parametric estimating is not used for these tasks (or
    processes).

51. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because a project schedule network diagram is an output item
    of the activity sequencing process.
    A, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these are input items to the activity
    sequencing process.

52. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because the project scope management plan specifies how the
    proposed changes to the project will be managed.
    A and B are incorrect because you should check the scope management plan first.
    D and E are incorrect because these documents are not meant to contain the change
    management information.

53. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because the network diagrams are the output of the activity
    sequencing process.
    A and B are incorrect because PDM (precedence diagramming method) and ADM
    (arrow diagramming method) are techniques used in the activity sequencing process.
    C is incorrect because the WBS is an output of the create WBS process.
346   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        54. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because once a change request is made, it is your responsibility
            to evaluate the impact of the change across the project.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because you are taking an action without investigating.

        55. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the resource breakdown structure is an output of the
            resource estimating process.
            B is incorrect because the risk breakdown structure is not an output of the resource
            estimating process.
            C is incorrect because the WBS is an output of the create WBS process.
            D is incorrect because the activity list is an input item to the resource estimating
            process.

        56. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the Delphi technique is an information-gathering
            technique used to solicit expert opinions anonymously by hiding the identities of the
            experts to prevent the domination of one expert.
            A, B, and C are incorrect because the Delphi technique is basically an information-
            gathering technique.

        57. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because all these processes belong to time management.
            A is incorrect because the monitor and control project work process belongs to inte-
            gration management.
            B is incorrect because schedule compression is not a process.
            D is incorrect because the develop project team process belongs to human resource
            planning.

        58. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because this is the correct order of process execution.
            B is incorrect because the WBS is an input to the activity definition process, so the
            WBS must be created before performing the activity definition process.
            C is incorrect because resource requirements are an input to the activity duration esti-
            mating process, so the activity resource estimating process must be performed before
            the activity duration estimating process.
            D is incorrect because you need the resource requirements and the activity durations
            before you can develop the schedule.

59. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because the person or the team that will perform the work will
    have more realistic understanding of what is involved and how long it will take.
    A is incorrect because the project manager might not know the technical details of the
    work involved. Of course, the project manager will facilitate the estimate and make
    sure it happens in a timely fashion.
    C, D, and E are incorrect because the customer, senior management, and sponsor
    generally will not know the technical details of the work involved.

60. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because this is the wrong statement about the critical path.
    A, B, and C are incorrect because these are the defining statements for the critical
    path.

61. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because the work breakdown structure (WBS) dictionary con-
    tains the description of each work package in the WBS.
    A, C, and D are incorrect because these documents do not contain the work package
    descriptions.

62. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because the critical chain method adds duration buffers that
    are not work schedule activities to maintain focus on the planned activity durations.
    A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not true statements about the critical
    chain method.

63. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because the three-point estimating technique determines the
    uncertainty on the activity duration, which is taken as the average of optimistic, most
    likely, and pessimistic values.
    A is incorrect because the final value is the average value of the optimistic, most likely,
    and pessimistic values.
    C and D are incorrect because these are the false statements about the three-point
    estimating technique.

64. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because analogous estimating is the duration estimating tech-
    nique used to determine the duration of an activity based on the duration of a similar
    activity in a previous project.
    A, B, and C are incorrect because these are the false statements about the analogous
    estimating technique.

            value technique.

        66. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because rolling wave planning is a technique used in the activ-
            ity definition process to plan the project work at various levels of detail depending
            upon the availability of information.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the rolling wave
            planning technique.

        67. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because parametric estimating uses historical values and other
            variables to estimate activity duration and cost.

            estimating technique.

        68. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the actual cost of the completed work is not required
            to calculate EV according to the following equation:
                  EV = BAC * (work completed) / (total work required)
            B, C, and D are incorrect answers because each of these items is used in calculating EV.

        69. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the cost variance is calculated as the earned value
            minus the actual cost.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because these are wrong representations of cost variance.

        70. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because CPI is calculated as the ratio of the earned value and
            the actual cost of the performed work.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because these are wrong representations of CPI.

71. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the activity list is an input to a number of processes,
    including activity sequencing, activity resource estimating, activity duration estimat-
    ing, and schedule development.
    B is incorrect because the activity list is an output of activity definition.
    C is incorrect because the WBS is an input to the activity definition process that gen-
    erates the activity list.
    D is incorrect because the activity list is not there yet when you are planning the scope.

72. Answer: C
    C is the correct answer because
          ETC = BAC - EV = 300 - 90 = 210
    A, B, and D are incorrect because the formula for the given values does not provide
    these results.

73. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because
           ETC = BAC - EV, and
           EAC = ETC + AC = 300 - 90 + 100 = 310
    A, C, and D are incorrect because the formula for the given values does not provide
    these results.

74. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because:
          Cost performance index (CPI) = EV / AC
          From the given data, 1 / CPI = AC / EV = 0.83
          Therefore AC = EV * 0.85 = 120 * 0.83 = 99.6
    A, B, and C are incorrect because the formula for the given values does not provide
    these results.

75. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the activity list is an input to schedule development,
    but it is not an input item to schedule control.
    B, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are input to the schedule
    control process.
350   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        76. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the term "float" is synonymous with the term "slack,"
            which is the time by which you can delay an activity without affecting the early start
            date of the next activity in the sequence.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not mean the same in project management
            as the term float does.

        77. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the schedule development process uses the leads and
            lags technique to adjust when the successor activity should start relative to the finish
            date of the predecessor activity.
            A, B, and C are incorrect because the leads and lags technique is irrelevant to these
            processes.

        78. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the project scope statement is a major input item to
            the quality planning process.
            B and C are incorrect because quality checklists and quality metrics are the output of
            the quality planning process.
            D is incorrect because cost of quality is a technique used in quality planning.

        79. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because recommended preventive actions are usually the out-
            put of a control process, such as the quality control process.
            A, B, and C are wrong answers because all of these are valid output items for the
            quality planning process.

        80. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because you must have a quality management plan generated
            by the quality planning process before you perform any other quality process.
            A is incorrect because quality definition is not a valid name for any process recognized
            by PMI.
            C and D are incorrect because quality control and quality assurance need to be per-
            formed according to the quality management plan generated by the quality planning
            process.

        81. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because a Pareto chart is a technique used in the quality con-
            trol process.
            A, B, and D are incorrect answers because these are all input items to the quality con-
            trol process.

82. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because quality assurance is the process used to apply the
     planned quality activities and standards to ensure that the project employs all
     processes needed to meet the project requirements.
     A and B are incorrect because quality control is used to monitor the results to deter-
     mine whether they comply with the quality standards, and quality planning is used to
     determine which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to meet them.
     D is incorrect because there is no PMI process called testing.

83. Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because benchmarking is a technique for quality planning, not
     for quality control.
     A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these represent the techniques that can
     be used in quality control.

84. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because quality metrics is the output of the quality planning
     process, and you are performing the quality assurance process.
     A, C, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are valid outputs of the
     quality assurance process.

85. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because a cause and effect diagram, also called an Ishikawa
     diagram, is a tool used in the perform quality control process to explore all the poten-
     tial causes of a problem.
     A and B are incorrect because an Ishikawa diagram is a tool used in the quality control
     process.
     D is incorrect because auditing is a technique used in the QA process.
     E is incorrect because inspection is another tool used in the quality control process.

86. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because the control chart is a technique used in quality con-
    trol, not in risk management.
    A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these are characteristics of a control
    chart.
87. Answer: A and D
    A and D are the correct answers because there is no such quality control tool as a
    regression diagram, and benchmarking is a tool used for quality planning.
    B, C, E, and F are the incorrect answers because all these represent valid tools and
    techniques for quality control.
352   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        88. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because benchmarking is a quality planning technique that
            compares practices, products, or services of a project with those of some reference pro-
            jects for the purpose of learning, improving, and creating the basis for measuring per-
            formance.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about the benchmarking
            technique.

        89. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because creating the WBS is necessary to understand and
            finalize the scope of the project and to determine the schedule activities.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because creating the WBS is necessary to understand and
            finalize the scope of the project and to determine the schedule activities.

        90. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because there is no PMI process called procurement quality
            planning.
            A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these processes belong to quality man-
            agement.

        91. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the risk register is the only output of the risk identifi-
            cation process.
            A is incorrect because the recommended corrective actions could be the output of the
            risk monitoring and control process, but not of the risk identification process.
            C and D are incorrect because these are not the output items of the risk identification
            process.

        92. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because there is no risk response strategy named audit.
            A, B, and C are incorrect because avoid, transfer, and mitigate are the strategies to
            respond to negative risks (threats).

        93. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because a good mitigation strategy is to take action early on to
            first reduce the probability of the risk happening, and then plan for reducing its
            impact if it does occur, rather than letting it occur and then trying to reduce the
            impact or repair the damage.
            B, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are correct statements about
            mitigation.

94. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because the risk register is the output of the risk identification
    process.
    A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are input to the risk identification
    process.

95. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because the processes in risk management are risk manage-
    ment planning, risk identification, qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis,
    risk response planning, and risk monitoring and controlling.
    B is incorrect because risk evaluation is not a risk management process.
    C is incorrect because risk evaluation and risk mitigation are not risk management
    processes.
    D is incorrect because risk transference and risk assessment are not risk management
    processes.

96. Answer: A
    A is the correct answer because work packages, the components at the lowest levels of
    the WBS, are decomposed into activities. The activities eventually make it into the
    project schedule.
    B, C, and D are incorrect because activities are derived from the work packages of the
    WBS.

97. Answer: D
    D is the correct answer because risk response planning is used to develop options to
    maximize opportunities and minimize threats from the risks that have already been
    identified and analyzed.
    A, B, and C are incorrect because the risks are identified and analyzed before you look
    at the options to enhance opportunities and reduce risks from them.
    E is incorrect because the risk monitoring and control process is used to execute risk
    response plans rather than develop them.

98. Answer: B
    B is the correct answer because recommended corrective actions are an output of the
    risk monitoring and control process but not of the risk response planning process.
    A, C, and D are incorrect answers because these items are outputs of the risk response
    planning process.
354   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


        99. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because an acceptance strategy is used to accept the risk--that
            is, either take no action or take action contingent upon a condition that might become
            true in the future.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because these are false interpretations of the acceptance
            strategy.

       100. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because performance reports are input to the risk monitoring
            and control process.
            A, B, and D are incorrect answers because all these items are output of the risk moni-
            toring and control process.

            B is the correct answer because all the listed items are techniques that can be used in
            quantitative risk analysis.
            A is incorrect because mitigation is a risk response planning strategy.
            C is incorrect because checklist analysis is a technique used in the risk identification
            process.
            D is incorrect because contingency is a risk response strategy.

       102. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because risk response planning is performed in the risk
            response planning process.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because these are valid output items that can be included in
            the risk management plan document.

       103. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the risks are prioritized in the qualitative risk analysis.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because the probability and impact matrix is a technique
            used in the qualitative risk analysis.

       104. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because risk audits are used in the risk monitoring and control
            process.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are tools and techniques for the qualitative
            risk analysis process that can be used to prioritize risks.

       105. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the WBS is not part of the risk register.
            A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these items are part of the risk register
            after the updates from the risk response planning process.
                                                      FINAL EXAM              Appendix B          355


106. Answer: C
     C is the correct and the best answer because the project plan is developed starting
     from the concept and going through progressive elaboration.
     A and B are incorrect because A is the lifecycle and B includes the project lifecycle.
     Progressive elaboration does not include the lifecycle of the project; its goal is to plan
     the project. Because the project planning may develop (or change) throughout the
     project lifecycle, progressive elaboration may continue through the project lifecycle,
     but it does not include the work of the lifecycle.
     D is incorrect because it is the technique to create the WBS.

107. Answer: B and D
     B and D are correct because the project charter names the project manger and pro-
     vides the project manager the authority to use organizational resources to run the pro-
     ject.
     A is incorrect because the sponsor is not authorized by the project charter; the oppo-
     site might be true.
     C is incorrect because it will be your responsibility to identify all the stakeholders.
     E is incorrect because the project team is not formed in the initiation phase.

108. Answer: B
     B is correct because the project assumptions should be included in the project charter.
     A is incorrect because assumptions by definition represent uncertainty, and as a project
     manager, it is your responsibility to validate the assumptions at various stages of the
     project.
     C is incorrect because it is not the correct definition of assumption.
     D is incorrect because you can start the project with the assumptions. All you have to
     do is validate them at various stages of the project and analyze them as part of the risk
     management.

109. Answer: B
     B is correct because the project charter is created in the initiation stage and it is an
     input item to creating the preliminary project scope statement.
     A is incorrect because the project charter is input to the develop preliminary project
     scope process used to create the preliminary project scope statement.
     C is incorrect because the WBS is created before schedule development, and the pro-
     ject charter is created before the WBS.
     D is incorrect because the project scope statement is an input item into creating the
     WBS.

            planning process.

       111. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the scope statement, the WBS document, and the
            WBS dictionary combined make the scope baseline against which all the change
            requests will be evaluated.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because all these are true statements about the project scope
            management plan.

       112. Answer: C
            C is correct because, you, the project manager, create the WBS with help from the
            project team.
            A is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with the help from the
            team.
            B is incorrect because the project manager creates the WBS with the help from the
            team. The project sponsor can help as part of the team, however.
            D and E are incorrect because neither the customer nor the upper management of the
            performing organization creates the WBS.

       113. Answer: D
            D is correct because benchmarking can be used in quality planning but not in human
            resource planning.

     C is the correct answer because decision tree analysis is the technique used in the
     quantitative risk analysis.
     A, B, and D are incorrect answers because brainstorming, the Delphi technique, and
     SWOT analysis are the valid information-gathering techniques used for identifying
     risks.

117. Answer: C
     C is correct because secondary risks are those risks that arise as a result of risk
     responses.
     A is incorrect because a residual risk is a risk that remains after a response has been
     performed.
     B is incorrect because depending upon the nature of the secondary risk, it can have
     any priority.
     D and E are incorrect because the risk response will depend upon the analysis results
     of the risk.

118. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because an activity has external dependency when it relies on
     factors outside the project.
     B is incorrect because an activity Y has a mandatory dependency on activity X when Y
     inherently depends on X.
     C is incorrect because there is no such dependency called internal.
     D is incorrect because we have an external dependency here.
     E is incorrect because a finish-to-start relationship is not relevant to this dependency.

119. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because personal choices, such as lifestyles or political and reli-
     gious beliefs, should not be considered during these assignments.

360   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


       133. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because fixed price (or lump sum) is the most suitable contract
            type for a well-defined product.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because the product to be procured is well-defined.

       134. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because cost overrun is paid by the buyer, and the fee increases
            with the increase in cost as well.
            A is incorrect because the firm fixed price presents risks to both buyer and seller
            because the fixed price might turn out to be above or below the actual cost.
            C and D are incorrect because the fee in these cases does not rise with the rise of the
            actual cost.
            E is incorrect because in a time and material contract, there could be a cost overrun to
            be paid by the buyer, but unlike a contract in the category of cost plus percentage of
            cost, there is no increasing fee attached to the increasing cost.

       135. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the procurement documents should be rigorous
            enough to ensure consistent responses from different sellers that can be fairly com-
            pared with one another, and flexible enough to allow the sellers to offer suggestions
            on better ways to satisfy the requirements.
            A is incorrect because it does not allow the sellers to be creative on offering solutions.
            B is incorrect because the documents must be rigid enough that each seller under-
            stands the requirements.
            D is incorrect because the requirements are set by the buyer, not by the seller.

       136. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because when managed properly, differences in opinion can
            lead to better decisions and increased productivity.

            management.

       137. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because this is not the recommended approach toward adver-
            tising. It is a useful tool that can be used in the request seller responses process.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because all of these are true statements about advertising as
            a tool in the request seller responses process.

     project execution process.

139. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the manage project team process belongs to the pro-
     ject human resource management.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because all these processes are part of project integration
     management.

140. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because you might need to negotiate with functional managers
     to acquire project team members.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because negotiation is not one of the tools used in these
     processes.

     C is the correct answer because administrative closure must be performed at the end
     of a project or each phase of a project.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because these are false statements about administrative clo-
     sure.

142. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because releasing resources is part of the close project process.
     A and B are incorrect because there are no PMI processes named resource release and
     administrative closure. Administrative closure is a procedure that is an output of the
     close project process.
     D is incorrect because resources are released by using the close project process.

143. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because a Pareto diagram is a tool used in the perform quality
     control process to rank errors based on the frequency of occurrences.
     B and C are incorrect because a Pareto diagram is a tool used in the quality control
     process.
     D is incorrect because auditing is a technique used in the QA process.

       144. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because the formula for cost variance is:
                   EV = BAC * (work completed / total work required)
            which means
                   EV = $600,000 (10 miles / 30 miles) = $200,000
                   CV = EV - AC
            which means
                   CV = $200,000 - $150,000 = $50, 000
            A, C, and D are incorrect because if the correct formula is applied, these results will
            not be achieved.

       145. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because a CPI value greater than 1 means the cost perfor-
            mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than 1 means
            the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because a CPI value greater than 1 means the cost perfor-
            mance of the project is better than planned, and an SPI value of greater than 1 means
            the schedule performance of the project is better than planned.

       146. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because the close project process is part of project integration
            management.
            A and B are incorrect because the close project process is part of project integration
            management.
            C is incorrect because monitoring and controlling is a process group, not a knowledge
            area.

       147. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because implementation of recommended actions can be the
            output of the direct and manage project execution process.
            A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are the output of the close project
            process.

       148. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because the contract closure procedure is the output of the
            close project process, not the input.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because all these items are valid input to the close project
            process.

149. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the risk probability and impact matrix is a tool for the
     qualitative risk analysis.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because all these items are included in the risk register.

150. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because dynamic programming is a mathematical model, not a
     benefit measurement method.
     A, B, D, and E are incorrect because these are the valid project selection methods
     included in the category of benefit measurement methods.

151. Answer: A
     B is the correct answer because a project can have positive as well as negative stake-
     holders.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because these are true statements.

152. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because change requests are approved or rejected by processing
     them through the integrated change control process.
     A is incorrect because there is no PMI process named change approval.
     B and D are incorrect because schedule control and quality control can generate rec-
     ommendations for actions and requests for changes, but those actions and changes
     must be approved through the change control process.

153. Answer: A and B
     A and B are the correct answers because the initiating process group contains two
     processes: develop project charter and develop preliminary project scope statement.
     C and D are incorrect because project management and the project schedule are
     developed in the planning stage of the project.

154. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because a project manager is assigned to the project in the pro-
     ject charter, which is an output of the processes in the initiating process group.
     A and C are incorrect because a project cannot start until the project charter is
     approved and the project charter names the project manager.
     D is incorrect because there is no such process group called staffing.
364   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


       155. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because risk was discovered during execution and was not
            identified during planning.
            A is incorrect because testing is not a project management process.
            B is incorrect because risk was discovered during execution and was not identified
            during planning.
            D is incorrect because quantitative risk analysis is performed during the planning stage.
            E is incorrect because executing is not a process; it is a process group.

       156. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because it is a wrong statement about a program. A program is
            a set of related projects that can produce independent products for different customers.
            A, B, and C are incorrect answers because these are the characteristics of a program.

       157. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because changes are implemented by using the direct and
            manage project execution process.
            A, B, and C are incorrect answers because all these items are output of the integrated
            change control process.

       158. Answer: B
            B is the correct answer because after you have planned the procurement by using the
            plan purchases and acquisitions process and possibly also the plan contracting process,
            the next process will be request seller responses.
            A is incorrect because you have just finished the plan purchases and acquisitions
            process.
            C is incorrect because the select sellers process is performed after request seller
            responses.
            D is incorrect because there is no project management process named request bidders.

       159. Answer: D
            D is the correct answer because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the
            project stakeholders' expectations and keep them on the same page about the project
            objectives.
            A is incorrect because it is the project manager's responsibility to manage the project
            stakeholders' expectations.
            B and C are incorrect because the differences about objectives (and conflicts among
            the team members) must be resolved. Different expectations from the project mean
            that the stakeholders are not on the same page about the project scope, and that can
            be damaging to the project.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix B          365


160. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because it deals with the problem head-on with the intention
     of solving it.
     A, C, and D are incorrect because by choosing any one of these options, you are not
     dealing with the problem directly and effectively.

161. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because the first thing you should do about a change request is
     study its effects and process it through the change control process.
     A, C, and D are incorrect answers because the change first must go through the
     change control process.

162. Answer: D
     D is the correct answer because there is no such method as project-oriented program-
     ming used for project selection.
     A, B, C, and E are incorrect because these are the valid project selection methods
     included in the category of mathematical models. Another method included in this
     model is dynamic programming.

163. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the code of conduct clearly states that any situation
     that can be looked upon as conflict of interest should be disclosed.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because you are not being upfront and open.

164. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because your job is to understand and resolve the conflicts, not
     to create them.
     A, B, D, and E are incorrect because these are true statements.

165. Answer: C and F
     C and F are the correct answers because these are not part of the PMP Code of Pro-
     fessional Conduct.
     A, B, D, and E are all incorrect because these activities are included in the PMP
     Code of Professional Conduct.
366   Appendix B FINAL EXAM


       166. Answer: A and B
            A and B are the correct answers because the project charter and the preliminary pro-
            ject scope statement are the two documents produced by the two processes in the ini-
            tiating process group.
            C is incorrect because there is no such document called the project initiation plan
            document.
            D and E are incorrect because the project management plan and project schedule are
            produced in the planning stage of the project.

       167. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because if in a foreign land you are asked to do something that
            is unethical and illegal, you are supposed to investigate whether it is illegal and uneth-
            ical there as well.
            B and D are incorrect because you don't know yet whether the sponsor is asking you
            to do something illegal.
            C is incorrect because you think it is unethical and illegal, so you must investigate it.

       168. Answer: A and B
            A and B are the correct answers because the initiating process group contains two
            processes: develop project charter and develop preliminary project scope statement.
            C and D are incorrect because project management and the project schedule are
            developed in the planning stage of the project.

       169. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because if the project sponsor has cancelled the project, it's the
            end of the story, but you still need to close the project using the close project process.
            A, B, and D are incorrect because these are not the appropriate actions to take.

       170. Answer: A
            A is the correct answer because the purpose of the change control is to manage the
            changes, not necessarily oppose them.
            B, C, and D are incorrect because all these are valid purposes of the integrated change
            control process.

       171. Answer: C
            C is the correct answer because once you have a list of activities, you can sequence
            them.
            A is incorrect because there are a number of processes that must be performed after
            preparing the list of activities and before scheduling the activities.
            B is incorrect because you must have a schedule before you can control it.
            D is incorrect because you must have a WBS before you can create a list of activities.
                                                    FINAL EXAM              Appendix B          367


172. Answer: A
     A is the correct answer because qualitative risk analysis is performed before quantita-
     tive risk analysis, and planning is performed before executing.
     B is incorrect because qualitative risk analysis is performed before quantitative risk
     analysis.
     C is incorrect because planning is performed before executing.
     D is incorrect because you must identify and analyze risks before you can control
     them.

173. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because you cannot control a schedule unless you have a
     schedule; it's common sense. (Remember Thomas Paine?)
     A, B, D, and E are incorrect answers because all these processes need to be performed
     before you can develop the project schedule.

174. Answer: C
     C is the correct answer because the baseline should only be changed due to the
     approved changes in the factors that define the baseline.
     A, B, and D are incorrect because these are no reasons to change the baseline.

175. Answer: B
     B is the correct answer because project management involves performing processes
     belonging to knowledge areas, and you use your experience and skills to perform those
     processes.
     A is incorrect because this is not the defining characteristic of project management.
     C is incorrect because project management is a discipline that exists independent of
     functional managers.
     D is incorrect because the size of the project is not a criterion for using project man-
     agement. Each project needs to be managed for efficient execution.
