Sample Text: «"The volatility of the client requirements did not stop. In every other check point, there were new requirements that were apparently new discoveries. In one instance, a couple of new and fairly complex features were introduced. Each feature had a number smaller features. To add to the complexity, there was a fair degree of interdependency between the features. The project management methodology adopted by Nazareth was just not suited for such a high degree of dynamic development. It was too late in the project to experiment with Agile methodologies, such as Feature Driven Development. He could have also benefited from prioritizing scope based on risk and value. Even though the client was paying for these additions, the deadline was fixed. Nazerath battled to get new resources on board. The ones he got, needed time for ramping up.

Sample Text: «"One of the worst things about project management problems is that the team gets to bear the brunt. And, this was no exception. The Project Execution phase was all about people working late and not maintaining a work–life balance. Personal growth and coaching activities only existed on paper. The team just worked and worked, trying to play catch-up. Everyone seemed to have a short fuse and it was common for team members to use Elm as a truce broker. More often than not, Elm favored the Compromise approach to resolving conflicts. With the entire team compromising, the team’s happiness was taking a knock and morale was at an all time low. Many team members chose to jump ship. When the project is in the Project Execution phase, retaining talent is a challenge; hiring talent is a greater challenge.
On retrospect, Nazareth was better of using a different approach to conflict resolution, such as problem-solving. He might have also focused on developing intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in the team."»

MOST (6973, 0.5935649871826172): «With regard to project team procurement, reasons why the project manager can use this alternative include, but are not limited to, the following: * The performing organization lacks the internal resources with the needed skills to complete the project work. * The work is more cost-effective to procure. * The project team members are present within the organization, but they are not available to the current project because of the organizational structure, such as a functional or projectized structure. * The project team members are present within the organization, but they cannot complete the needed work due to other project assignments. Managing a Virtual Team Placing all of the project team members in one geographical location is ideal for many project managers. In theory, having all of the project team members together allows the team members to quickly communicate, work with each other, and generally work better as a team. In reality, that's not always possible: Team members are spread around the globe, space isn't necessarily available in one locale, and other logistics could prevent bringing all of the project team together in a project war room. (And yes, there's no fighting in the war room.) Virtual teams, however, are more likely in today's world. Collaboration software, Internet tools, phone calls, and e-mails can help increase communications and the 09-ch09.indd 349 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 350 sense of a co-located team without the expense and improbability of a co-located team. Virtual teams allow the organization to: * Create a project team that comprises experts from around the globe * Permit people to work from home offices * Permit people to work different shifts and hours * Include people on the project team who may have mobility limitations * Save monies by not incurring travel expenses EXAM TIP The negative side to virtual teams is that communication can be more difficult, and costs can be incurred from coordinating and managing the needed communication among the virtual team. Utilizing a Multicriteria Decision Analysis Process A multicriteria decision analysis process sounds real formal, scientific, and scary, but it's mainly a method to rank a potential project team member on several factors to see if the person should be on the project team. To use this approach, you'd identify several factors, assign scores to the different factors, and then measure each team member by those factors. Here's a quick example I made up with scoring: * Skills, 5 points What skills does the person have that the project needs? * Knowledge, 3 points Does this person have specialized knowledge about the processes, the customer, or the project life cycle? * Costs, 6 points How much is this person going to cost the project? * Availability, 3 points Will this person be available for the duration of the project? * Experience, 4 points Does this person have experience with the technology the project will be implementing? Using these simple factors, you could measure and compare each potential team member and make a determination of their scored value to the project. You can add as many factors as needed and perhaps create a minimum threshold of points that the person must have to be invited onto your project team. Assembling the Project Team With the project team assembled, the project manager can continue planning, assigning activities, and managing the project progression. Project team members can be assigned to the project on a fullor part-time basis, depending on the project conditions. Once the project team is built, a project team directory should be assembled. The project team directory should include the project team members': 09-ch09.indd 350 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 351 * Names * Phone numbers * E-mail addresses * Mailing addresses, if the team is geographically dispersed As well as: PART II * Contact information for key stakeholders * Additional relevant contact information for team members, such as photos, web addresses, and so on Developing the Project Team The project team is developed by enhancing the competencies of the individual project team members and promoting the interaction of all the project team members. Throughout the project, the project manager will have to work to develop the project team. The project manager may have to develop an individual team member's skills so that she can complete her assignments. The project manager will also have to work to develop the project team as a whole so that the team can work together to complete the project. In matrix organizations, the project team members are accountable to the project manager and to their functional managers. Developing the project team can prove challenging, since the project team members may feel pulled between multiple bosses. The project manager must strive to involve and develop the project team members as individuals completing project work--and as team members completing the project objectives together. Preparing for Team Development Team development is a natural process, but it's also a process that the project manager can usher along. If you're the project manager and you want your team to work together, get along, and focus on completing the project rather than on who's really in charge of the project, you'll need these inputs: * Staff assignments The assignments of the project team members define their skills, their needs for development, and their abilities to complete the project work as individuals and as part of the team. * Human resource plan Recall that the human resource plan details how project team members will be brought onto the project, managed, and released from the project team. * Resource availability You'll need to know when your project team members are available and when they're vacationing in the desert. This component also considers when project team members are on multiple projects within your organization and allows you to plan for when you'll utilize the project team members best. 09-ch09.indd 351 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 352 Leading Project Team Development Due to the temporary nature of projects, it can be tough for a group of strangers to form relationships and immediately create a successful project. Team development is the guidance, direction, and leadership the project manager offers to influence a project team. The project manager needs interpersonal skills, sometimes called "soft" skills, to help alleviate the project team's fears, concerns, and anxiety about the project. The project manager should use empathy, leadership, and group facilitation to move team development along. Training the project team is one of the best team development exercises. The staffing management plan defines the need for training, and team development is the execution of that plan. In other words, if team members don't know how to do the project work, train them! Another facet of team development is a focus on getting the project work completed. The project managers are the power on the project team. While there may be some resistance from the project team to cooperate with the project manager, complete assigned duties, or participate as requested, the project team should realize that the project manager is the project authority. There are five types of powers that the project manager wields: * Expert The project manager's authority comes from both experience with the technology the project focuses on and from expertise in managing projects. * Reward The project manager has the authority to reward the project team. * Formal The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager by senior management and is in charge of the project. This is also known as positional power. * Coercive The project manager has the authority to discipline the project team members. This is also known as penalty power. When the team is afraid of the project manager, the project manager has coercive power. * Referent The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can also mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him or her the position--for example, "The CEO assigned me to this position, so we'll do it this way." This power can also mean the project team wants to work on the project or with the project manager due to the high priority and impact of the project. Creating Team-Building Activities Team-building activities are approaches to developing the team through facilitated events. The goal of team-building exercises is to allow the project team to learn about each other, rely on each other, and form cohesiveness among the project team members. Events can include: * Involving the team during planning processes * Defining rules for handling team disagreements 09-ch09.indd 352 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 353 * Holding off-site activities * Facilitating quick team-involvement activities * Facilitating activities to improve interpersonal skills and form relationships There's a general belief that project teams actually go through their own natural development processes. These processes can shift, linger, and even stall based on the dynamics of the project team. This theory of team development was created by Dr. PART II Bruce Tuckman in 1965. Here are the five phases of team development that project managers may face: * Forming The project team meets and learns about their roles and responsibilities on the project. Little interaction among the project team happens in this stage, as the team is learning about the project and project manager. The project manager guides the project team through this stage of team development by introducing members and helping them learn about one another. * Storming The project team struggles for project positions, leadership, and project direction. The project team can become hostile toward the project leader, challenge ideas, and try to establish and claim positions about the project work. The amount of debate and fury can vary depending on whether the project team is willing to work together, the nature of the project, and the control of the project manager. The project manager's role in this stage is to mediate disagreement and squelch unproductive behavior. * Norming Project team members go about getting the project work, begin to rely on one another, and generally complete their project assignments. In this stage of team development, the project manager allows the project team to manage themselves. * Performing If a project team can reach the performing stage of team development, they trust one another, work well together, and issues and problems get resolved quickly and effectively. The project manager stays out of the project team's way, but is available to help the project team get their work done. * Adjourning Once the project is done, either the team moves onto other assignments as a unit, or the project team is disbanded and individual team members go on to other work. The project manager uses the staffing management plan as a guide for how project team members are released from the project team. NOTE Tuckman originally used just the first four stages of team development, but added adjourning to the model in the 1970s. 09-ch09.indd 353 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 354 Establishing Project Ground Rules Creating ground rules for the project team is part of team development. Ground rules establish the project expectations for the project team and define what is and is not acceptable behavior by all of the project team members, including the project manager. When all of the project team members agree to abide by the defined ground rules, misunderstandings diminish while productivity increases. Once ground rules are defined, it's the responsibility of all the project team members to enforce them. EXAM TIP Ground rules are enforced by the project team, not just the project manager. Relying on Interpersonal Management Skills As a project manager, you need interpersonal skills to lead the project team. You might know these as soft skills or emotional intelligence, but they're really about understanding what motivates a person, how you can lead the person, and how to really listen to a person on your project team. While project management is about getting things done, you're dealing with people that have issues, concerns, stress, anxiety, and a life beyond your project. You need to listen to the project team, empathize with them as needed, and help them manage their project work and assignment. This is a great example where a more experienced project manager can shift from the project manager role and see the project from the perspective of the team member. A chunk of project management relies on interpersonal skills. Specifically, the project manager relies on: * Leading Good project managers master the art of establishing direction, aligning people, and motivating the project team to complete the project work. * Communicating Good project managers are good communicators. Remember, half of communicating is listening. * Negotiating Project managers will likely negotiate for scope, cost, terms, assignment, and resources. * Problem solving Project managers must have the ability to confront and solve problems. * Influencing Project managers use their influence to get things done. Rewarding the Project Team When discussing human resource planning, I mentioned that you, the project manager, should create the rewards and recognition system. This system is part of team development and encourages the behavior you want from your project team--that is, the behavior that promotes the project to completion and meets the project scope statement. Performance appraisals tell the project manager, and sometimes functional manage09-ch09.indd 354 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 355 ment, which team members should be rewarded based on the confines of the reward system. Obviously, positive behavior should be rewarded. If a project team member willingly agrees to work overtime to ensure that the project will hit its schedule objective, that should be rewarded or recognized by the project manager. However, if a project team member has to work overtime because he has wasted time or resources, a reward is not in order. PART II Win-lose awards, sometimes called zero-sum awards, should be avoided because they can hurt the project team's cohesiveness. Any award where only some of the project team members can qualify shouldn't be given. For instance, I once worked on a project where the project manager awarded the software developer who created the most code a bonus every month. Well, since I wasn't a software developer, I could never qualify for that bonus. (Thanks a lot, Ron! Ron was my boss then, and oh what sweet printed vengeance this is. Just kidding... He dropped the bonus program when he saw the trouble with his plan.) EXAM TIP Your reward and recognition system should also consider cultural differences. Creating team rewards in a culture that encourages individualism can be difficult. In other words, the reward system must mesh with the culture within which the project manager is operating. Assessing the Project Team You want your project team to be the best unit of people possible. You want them to rely on one another, help each other, and communicate without fear of retribution. You also want the project team to be competent in the project work and execution of the project management plan. Personnel assessment tools, such as exams and surveys, can help you gain some insight into the project team and where each person's strengths and weaknesses lie. This can help you determine how to better manage the project team, improve performance, and gain insight into what motivates team members. The assessments of the project team can measure all sorts of factors, but there are some common measurements as a result of the assessment program: * Technical success of the project execution * Project schedule adherence * Cost baseline management * Improvement in competencies * Reduction in staff turnover * Team functionality in communications and problem solving Project team members' performance is reviewed and tied to their overall performance on the project team. Performance appraisals can be in the form of a 360-degree 09-ch09.indd 355 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 356 appraisal, where a project team member is reviewed in all directions by the project team, the project manager, stakeholders, and even vendors, where appropriate. Managing the Project Team Now that the project manager has planned for the human resources and developed the project team, he can focus on managing the project team. This process involves tracking each team member's performance, offering feedback, taking care of project issues, and managing those pesky change requests that can affect the project team and its work. The staffing management plan may be updated based on lessons learned and changes within the team management process. In a matrix environment, where the project team members are accountable to both the project manager and a functional manager, team management is a tricky business. The project manager and the functional managers need to work together to communicate the utilization of the project team member in both operations and on the project. The project team's demand for dual reporting to the project manager and the functional manager also has to be considered--and is often the responsibility of the project manager rather than the functional manager or project team member. Preparing for Team Management Managing the project team is based on many conditions and scenarios within the project. Management of the project team is really about one thing: getting the project work done as promised in the project scope statement. There are many inputs to project team management: * Human resource plan You know this plan, right? Just in case you forgot, it defines when project team members will complete their project work, the training needs for the project, certification requirements, and any labor compliance issues. It's an output of human resources planning. * Project staff assignments The project manager and the project management team both need a listing of the project staff assignments in order to monitor and evaluate each project team member's project performance. * Team performance assessments You'll know if your project team is doing a good job or not, but you'll want to quantify their performance so that you can make recommendations where needed. Assessments include information on the project team's skills, competencies, turnover rate, and team cohesion. * Issue log Any issues that have been found in the project should be documented in this log. A project team member is assigned to the resolution of the issue by a given date, so this log is considered an input to managing the project team. * Work performance reports The project management team observes and records the work a project team member performs. This doesn't necessarily 09-ch09.indd 356 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 357 mean the project management team peers over the shoulder of the project team member, but rather observes the team member's participation in team activities, their delivery on action items, and thoroughness in communication. * Organizational process assets Consider the organization's approach to rewarding employees for their work in a project. Organizational process assets in team management rely on dinners, certificates of appreciation, newsletters, and other methods to recognize a project team's hard work on a project. PART II All of these inputs feed directly into the actual process of managing the project team. The project manager and the project management team will use the evidence of these things to better manage the team in order to move the project toward completion. Dealing with Team Disagreements In most projects, there will be instances when the project team, management, and other stakeholders disagree on the progress, decisions, and proposed solutions within the project. It's essential for the project manager to keep calm, lead, and direct the parties to a sensible solution that's best for the project. Here are seven reasons for conflict, listed from most common to least common: * Schedules * Priorities * Resources * Technical beliefs * Administrative policies and procedures * Project costs * Personalities EXAM TIP You can expect questions on these areas of conflict on the exam. Don't be duped into thinking personality conflicts are the biggest problem with conflict resolution. They are the least important. So what's a project manager to do with all the potential for strife in a project? There are five different approaches to conflict resolution: * Collaborate/Problem Solve This approach utilizes multiple viewpoints and perspectives to find a resolution. To utilize this method, the participants need a collaborative attitude to confront the problem rather than each other. * Force/Direct The person with the power makes the decision. The decision made may not be the best decision for the project, but it's fast. As expected, this autocratic approach does little for team development and is a win-lose 09-ch09.indd 357 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 358 solution. It should be used when the stakes are high and time is of the essence, or if relationships are not important. * Compromise/Reconcile This approach requires that both parties give up something. The decision made is a blend of both sides of the argument. Because neither party really wins, it is considered a lose-lose solution. The project manager can use this approach when the relationships are equal and no one can truly "win." This approach can also be used to avoid a fight. * Smoothing/Accommodating This approach smoothes out the conflict by minimizing the perceived size of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm team relations and boisterous discussions. Smoothing may be acceptable when time is of the essence or when any of the proposed solutions will not currently settle the problem. This can be considered a lose-lose situation as well, since no one really wins in the long run. The project manager can use smoothing to emphasize areas of agreement between disagreeing stakeholders and thus minimize areas of conflict. * Withdrawal/Avoidance This conflict resolution has one side of the argument walking away from the problem, usually in disgust. The conflict is not resolved, and it is considered a yield-lose solution. The approach can be used, however, as a cooling-off period or when the issue is not critical. Creating an Issue Log It's okay to have issues within a project as long as the issues are recorded in the issue log. An issue, technically, is something that may be preventing the project team from reaching the project objectives. Typically, issues are identified and recorded in the issue log. Each issue is assigned to an owner who needs to find a method that will resolve the issue by a given date. Each issue should also be identified as to its status and possible resolution. Common issues are: * Differences of opinion * Situations to be investigated * Unanticipated responsibilities that need to be assigned to someone on the project team Examining the Outputs of Team Management Team management begins as soon as the project team comes together, and ends as soon as the project is closed. Throughout the project, different conditions and scenarios will affect how the project manager and the project management team will manage the project and the resources within it. There are five outputs of managing the project team: 09-ch09.indd 358 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 359 * Requested changes Seems like just about everything can result in a change request, doesn't it? Changes to the project team can have ripple effects on the project scheduling, project cost, and even the project scope statement, so a change request is needed when these conditions are true. Corrective actions can include moving people to different assignments, outsourcing some of the project work, and replacing project team members who may have left the organization or project. Preventive actions can include cross-training, role PART II clarification, and even additional labor through hiring or procurement to ensure that all of the project work is completed as planned. * Project management plan updates Just like any other area of project management, if the project management plan needs to be updated, it should be. Project management plan updates could include approved change requests, corrective actions, new project team member roles, and training decisions. * Project document updates Updates to the issue log, role description, and staff assignments should be reflected in the project documents as needed. You may need to update the roles and responsibility charts, such as your RACI chart, to reflect the changes within the project and/or project team. * Enterprise environmental factor updates It is possible that your management approach could affect the enterprise environmental factors within your organization. You may need to update the process for performance appraisals and any information about project team members' new skills as a result of the project training. * Organizational process assets updates You'll need to update the organizational process assets for your project as a result of managing the project team. This will likely include any templates you've created, historical information, and lessons learned documentation. What the project management team learns in the project becomes part of organizational process assets for future projects. For example, lessons learned in human resources include: * Staffing management plan * Organizational charts * Position descriptions * Ground rules * Conflict management techniques * Successful rewards and recognition approaches * Procedures for virtual team management * Negotiating techniques * Training programs 09-ch09.indd 359 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 360 * Successful team-building exercises * Issues and solutions documented in the project log Relating to Organizational Theories You can expect to see some of these topics on your exam, so let's have a look at these theories in more detail. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs According to Abraham Maslow, people work to take care of a hierarchy of needs. The pinnacle of their needs is self-actualization. People want to contribute, prove their worth, and use their skills and abilities. Figure 9-4 shows the pyramid of needs that all people try to ascend by fulfilling each layer, one at a time. Maslow's five layers of needs, from lowest to highest, are: * Physiological People require these necessities to live: air, water, food, clothing, and shelter. * Safety People need safety and security. This can include stability in life, work, and culture. * Social People are social creatures and need love, approval, and friends. * Esteem People strive for the respect, appreciation, and approval of others. * Self-actualization At the pinnacle of needs, people seek personal growth, knowledge, and fulfillment. Figure 9-4 Maslow's theory states that people ultimately work for self-actualization. 09-ch09.indd 360 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 361 Herzberg's Theory of Motivation According to Frederick Herzberg, a psychologist and authority on the motivation of work, there are two catalysts for success with people: * Hygiene agents These elements are the expectations all workers have. They include job security, a paycheck, clean and safe working conditions, a sense of belonging, civil working relationships, and other basic attributes associated PART II with employment. * Motivating agents These are the elements that motivate people to excel. They include responsibility, appreciation of work, public recognition for a job well done, the chance to excel, education, and other opportunities associated with work aside from financial rewards. This theory says that the presence of hygiene factors will not motivate people to perform because these are expected attributes. However, the absence of these elements will demotivate performance. For people to excel, the presence of motivating factors must exist. Figure 9-5 illustrates Herzberg's Theory of Motivation. EXAM COACH Use Herzberg's Theory for your exam. Find some things that will motivate you to excel so you can pass your exam: a career advancement, a day off work, new clothes, or some other reward. Create an incentive that means something to you. After all, part of Herzberg's Theory is that the motivating agents have to interest the person that's being motivated. McGregor's Theory of X and Y Douglas McGregor's theory states that, from their perspective, management believes there are two types of workers, good and bad, as seen in Figure 9-6. Theory X sees workers as lazy, uninterested in doing the project work, and that they must be micromanaged Figure 9-5 Hygiene agents do nothing to motivate, but their absence will cause performance and morale to decline. 09-ch09.indd 361 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 362 Figure 9-6 X People Y People Management believes that "X" people are bad and "Y" people Micromanagement Self-led are good. No trust Motivated Lazy Capable Avoid work and coerced to do the work. Theory Y sees workers as good, self-directed, and able to do the work that's assigned to them. * X is bad. These people need to be watched all the time, micromanaged, and cannot be trusted. X people avoid work, shun responsibility, and lack the aptitude to achieve. * Y is good. These people are self-led, motivated, and can accomplish new tasks proactively. Ouchi's Theory Z William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management style of the Japanese. This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of commitment, opportunity, and advancement. Workers in an organization subscribing to Theory Z learn the business by moving up through the ranks of the company. Ouchi's theory also credits the idea of lifetime employment. Workers will stay with one company until they retire because they are dedicated to the company, which is in turn dedicated to them. EXAM TIP If you need a way to keep McGregor's X and Y and Ouchi's Z theories separate in your mind, think of this: X is bad;Y is good; Z is the best. Vroom's Expectancy Theory Vroom's Expectancy Theory states that people will behave based on what they expect as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the expected reward of the work. If the attractiveness of the reward is desirable to the worker, she will work to receive it. In other words, people expect to be rewarded for their effort. McClelland's Theory of Needs David McClelland developed his acquired-needs theory based on his belief that a person's needs are acquired and develop over time. These needs are shaped by circumstance, conditions, and life experiences for each individual. McClelland's Theory of Needs is also known as the Three Needs Theory because there are just three needs for 09-ch09.indd 362 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 363 each individual. Depending on the person's experiences, the order and magnitude of each need shifts: * Need for Achievement These people need to achieve, so they avoid both low-risk and high-risk situations. Achievers like to work alone or with other high achievers, and they need regular feedback to gauge their achievement and progress. PART II * Need for Affiliation People who have a driving need for affiliation look for harmonious relationships, want to feel accepted by people, and conform to the norms of the project team. * Need for Power People who have a need for power are usually seeking either personal or institutional power. Personal power generally is the ability to control and direct other people. Institutional power is the ability to direct the efforts of others for the betterment of the organization. McClelland developed the Thematic Apperception Test to determine what needs are driving individuals. The test is a series of pictures that the test taker must create a story about. Through the storytelling, the test taker will reveal which need is driving his or her life at that time. Chapter Summary The project manager has to plan for the needed human resources to complete the project work. In addition, the project manager plans for how the human resources will be managed, trained, motivated, and led throughout the duration of the project. The project management team works to identify the roles within the project and their responsibilities, which are the activities needed to complete the project work. The key output of planning for human resources is the staffing management plan, which defines how the project team will be acquired, managed, trained, rewarded for the work, and then released from the project team. The staffing management plan also defines how the project management team will comply with government regulations and will manage team safety concerns. The project team is acquired just as the staffing management plan specifies. The team, however, isn't always selected--it's often preassigned to the project. Sometimes, the project manager gets to negotiate with the functional managers and other project managers to get the best resources possible on the project. When the resources aren't available inside the organization, the project manager often has to deal with contracted help, which means procurement. Some teams all work together in one locale and might huddle in the project's war room. This idea of a co-located team supports ad-hoc conversations, team cohesiveness, and project performance. However, in many cases, the project team is not colocated, and a virtual team is created. Virtual teams allow people with mobility handicaps or travel issues, as well as home office workers, to be actively involved in the project. 09-ch09.indd 363 7/12/2013 4:50:51 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 364 Whatever conditions surround the project team, the project manager must work to develop the team. Team development centers on building team cohesiveness through team-building exercises, training, and team involvement. One team development tool and technique is the creation of ground rules. Ground rules are created and agreed upon by the project team to promote performance within the project. Once ground rules are created, it's up to the project team to enforce them. Through conversations, observations, performance appraisals, conflict management, and the issue log, the project manager will manage the project team. The goal of team management is getting the project done--meaning, it's all about results. Human resource theories, such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, McGregor's Theory of X and Y, Ouchi's Theory Z, and Vroom's Expectancy Theory, all seek to determine what motivates an employee to complete her project tasks. Project managers can use these theories to determine the best approach to motivate or inspire a project team member to elicit the behavior the project manager expects. Key Terms Adjourning Once the project is done, either the team moves onto other assignments as a unit, or the project team is disbanded and individual team members go on to other work. Authority power Project management team members may have authority over other project team members, may have the ability to make decisions, and perhaps even sign approvals for project work and purchases. Coercive power The project manager has the authority to discipline the project team members. This is also known as penalty power. Collaborate/Problem solving This approach confronts the problem head-on and is the preferred method of conflict resolution. Multiple viewpoints and perspectives contribute to the solution. Collective bargaining agreement constraints Contracts and agreements with unions or other employee groups may serve as constraints on the project. Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capabilities are needed to complete the project work. Compromising This approach requires that both parties give up something. Vroom's Expectancy Theory This theory states that people will behave based on what they expect as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the expected reward. Expert power The project manager's authority comes both from experience with the technology the project focuses on and from expertise in managing projects. Forcing power The person with the power makes the decision. 09-ch09.indd 364 7/12/2013 4:50:51 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 365 Formal power The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager by senior management and is in charge of the project. Forming The project team meets and learns about their roles and responsibilities on the project. Little interaction among the project team happens in this stage as the team is learning about the project and project manager. Herzberg's Theory of Motivation Frederick Herzberg's theory of the motivating agents and hygiene agents that affect a person's willingness to excel in his career. PART II Hierarchical organizational chart A chart showing the relationship between superior and subordinate employees, groups, disciplines, and even departments. Human resource plan This plan defines staff acquisition, the timetable for staff acquisition, the staff release plan, training needs for the project team, any organizational compliance issues, rewards and recognitions, and safety concerns for the project team doing the project work. Interpersonal interfaces This organizational interface considers the formal and informal reporting relationships that may exist among the project team members. The interpersonal interface also considers the job descriptions of the project team members, existing reporting structures between supervisors and subordinates, and existing relationships, if any, that may affect the project work. This interface also considers any cultural or language differences among the project team that may need to be addressed. Issue log A logbook of the issues the project team has identified and dates as to when the issues must be resolved by. The issue log may also include team members or stakeholders who are responsible for finding a solution to the identified issues. Logistical interfaces The logistics of the team locale, time zones, geographical boundaries, and travel requirements within a project. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Abraham Maslow's theory of the five needs all humans have and work toward. McClelland's Theory of Needs David McClelland developed this theory, which states our needs are acquired and developed by our experiences over time. All people are, according to this theory, driven by one of three needs: achievement, affiliation, or power. McGregor's Theory of X and Y Douglas McGregor's theory that states management views workers in the Y category as competent and self-led and workers in the X category as incompetent and needing to be micromanaged. Multicriteria Decision Analysis A method to rate potential project team members based on criteria such as education, experience, skills, knowledge, and more. Norming Project team members go about getting the project work, begin to rely on one another, and generally complete their project assignments. 09-ch09.indd 365 7/12/2013 4:50:51 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide 366 Organization chart Traditional chart that depicts how the organization is broken down by department and disciplines. This chart is sometimes called the organizational breakdown structure (OBS) and is arranged by departments, units, or teams. Organizational interfaces The project management team needs to identify which departments are going to be involved in the project. Organizational structure constraint The structure of the organization has a direct correlation to the amount of power a project manager has within a project. Ouchi's Theory Z William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management style of the Japanese. This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of commitment, opportunity, and advancement. Performing If a project team can reach the performing stage of team development, they trust one another, work well together, and issues and problems get resolved quickly and effectively. Political interfaces The hidden goals, personal agendas, and alliances among the project team members and the stakeholders. RACI chart A RACI chart is a matrix chart that only uses the activities of responsible, accountable, consult, and inform. Referent power The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can also mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him the position. Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This hierarchical chart can decompose the project by the type of resources used throughout it. Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correlation between project team members and the work they've been assigned to complete. Responsibility A responsibility is the work that a role performs. Reward The project manager has the authority to reward the project team. Role This denotes what a person is specifically responsible for in a project. Roles are usually tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical engineer, and electrician. Smoothing This approach smooths out the conflict by minimizing the perceived size of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm team relations and boisterous discussions. Staffing management plan A subsidiary plan of the project management plan that defines staff acquisition, timetables, release criteria, training needs, reward and recognition systems, compliance issues, and safety concerns for the project. Storming The project team struggles for project positions, leadership, and project direction. The project team can become hostile toward the project leader, challenge ideas, and try to establish and claim positions about the project work. The amount of 09-ch09.indd 366 7/12/2013 4:50:51 AM All-in-1 / CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One / Phillips / 177604-4 Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources 367 debate and fury can vary depending on if the project team is willing to work together, the nature of the project, and the control of the project manager. Technical interfaces The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties that the project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical interfaces are the resources that will be doing the project work. Withdrawal This conflict resolution method sees one side of the argument walking away from the problem, usually in disgust. PART II Questions 1. You are the project manager for the JHG Project.

Sample Text: «"With the project brimming with scope changes and scope creep, the critical path defined at the start of project execution kept changing. Pretty soon, Nazareth was too busy with stakeholder and scope management to worry about activities in the critical path. Apparently, in such a crisis situation he deemed all activities to have equal importance. It was a fire fighting situation and the fire was winning! Nazerath learned never to lose track of the activities in the critical path. Otherwise, schedule delays are bound to happen and you will face project management problems in the Project Execution phase.
